00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
- Brady, welcome to Talk Python to Me.


00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.400
- Thanks for having me, Michael.


00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.480
- Yeah, it's great to have you here.


00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.760
I think people are gonna learn a lot


00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.120
about some machine learning on this episode,


00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.440
and you've got this really cool visual way,


00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.360
this visual tool of working with machine learning projects.


00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.040
And oftentimes people ask me,


00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.400
like, hey, I'm not really a web developer,


00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.800
but I have some machine learning stuff,


00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.760
or I'm a data scientist,


00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.640
and I wanna share it with people, how do I do that?


00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.400
So your project might be a good answer


00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.440
to that for some folks, right?


00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.320
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.700
I think, yeah, Gradio is kind of built for that use case.


00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.680
I think you can build like lots of complex stuff


00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680
with Gradio, like, you know, web apps and stuff,


00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.040
but you could, it's optimized for the sort of like ML


00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.760
use case, like how do you get like an ML workflow,


00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.600
like on the web and share it with people


00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.440
as quickly as possible,


00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.000
that's kind of what Gradio is built for.


00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.840
Awesome.


00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.240
I've got it running on my computer.


00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.480
How do I take it from a notebook to something


00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.280
that other people who are not programmers can use, right?


00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.200
- Yeah, exactly.


00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.040
That's kind of it.


00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.380
And with Gradle, it's like one line.


00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.180
You can get a shareable link directly


00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.260
from your Colab notebook, Jupyter notebook, SageMaker,


00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.000
local, whatever.


00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.760
Yeah, so it's really easy to share with people.


00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.600
- Excellent.


00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840
All right, before we dive into that, let's start with you.


00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.280
Quick story, quick introduction about you


00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.320
and how you got into programming Python.


00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.160
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.440
So I guess all the way from the beginning,


00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.640
I graduated with a degree in statistics


00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.920
and my first job was working as a data scientist in Chicago


00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.780
and that was kind of doing more bread and butter


00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.240
sort of data science-y stuff,


00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.520
like you pull data from a database


00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.480
and you train a model


00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.000
and then you try to communicate the results with someone


00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.280
and then at the time,


00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.360
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't that long ago, but to me, it feels like it was like, a millennia ago.


00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.360
Technologically speaking, it's so different.


00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.360
Yeah.


00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.960
Yeah, it was like a really, really, really long time ago.


00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.720
Yeah, but then basically, like what, what happens or what happened to me a lot was just


00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.000
like, okay, like, we need to like, we're training this model, like, how do we share, like, share


00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.520
with like, the relevant like, stakeholders, right?


00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.640
There's like a PM or like someone that's interested in this, like, how do you, how do we, how


00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.640
do you make them care?


00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.280
And then there really wasn't a good answer.


00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.760
like you would have to like, you'd like compute like some metrics and then like, try to explain


00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.280
what they mean. And you like draw like a bar plot or something. And it just like wasn't really


00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.560
that, that useful. And I think it really kind of was, you know, to be fair, was kind of like a


00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.440
skill gap. I didn't even know how to like build like an interactive website to kind of share with


00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.560
people because like, you know, at the end of the day, what really what people really care about,


00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.320
or, or how to make someone really care about it is again, play with it, right? Because like,


00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.160
if you kind of show them these plots, and these metrics, it's like a machine learning models,


00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.480
is like very abstract, right? It's like just this thing that's somewhere else. And then


00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.680
like, this is kind of like the output of it, but it's not really even like the actual output.


00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.200
It's just like some sort of summary statistics of it. Right. But if you give someone like,


00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.040
this is what the model is, and you can let them like, manually play with the inputs and


00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.400
see how the outputs change, you know, they get a sense of like, well, like what the model


00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.440
is, and you know, how it works and stuff like that. Right. And I think, yeah, so that's


00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.340
kind of where I learned about this problem and why this problem is important. And then


00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.400
ever since then, I've been sort of devoting to, you know, devoting myself to working on


00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.440
like open source tools to like make data science like more efficient. And like my, my, the


00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.160
latest product that I worked on is called Cradio, which kind of does this. It basically


00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.680
lets you turn a machine learning function into a web app in one line of code. And from


00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.600
there, you can kind of jump off and build like, as complex of a web app as you want.


00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.560
But from the beginning, you can kind of get up and running with just like basically two


00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.560
lines of code.


00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.560
So yeah.


00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560
Excellent.


00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560
I love it.


00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.200
I mean, well, the you talked about, you know, let people play with the machine learning


00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.880
model and you change, change the inputs and stuff.


00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.480
It just completely changes the round trip speed because the alternative might be I'll


00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.200
make I'll get you a PDF and you can read the report and then what if we change this?


00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.920
All right, at tomorrow's meeting, I'll bring the new PDF.


00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.600
It's like, no, no, no, no, no.


00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.960
Just empower people and give them these tools.


00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.200
And yet, at the same time, data scientists


00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.120
are not web developers, certainly not


00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.040
in the super dynamic front end AJAX callback


00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.720
way of programming.


00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.840
That's a different skill, to be sure.


00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.040
And so it's not like their data science skills, by default,


00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.540
make them able to build these.


00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.560
And even if you could, is it a good use of your time, right?


00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.640
Yeah, absolutely. And yeah, I think like, yeah, so it's like the PDF report is definitely


00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.200
like one one way of doing it the other way that we tried to do sometimes is we'll just


00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.560
hand it off to someone and like, we'll, we'll have them build the web, but then that just


00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.240
takes longer, you have to like explain everything to them. Right? I think like the, you know,


00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.120
the way to like, kind of make it really impactful as if, you know, the person who made the model


00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.600
can they themselves, they can just create the web app, the demo, like immediately. And


00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.940
And a lot of data scientists are in Python, so that means you need a Python-based tool


00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.520
that can get you up and running really quickly.


00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.560
And a lot of them, like you said, don't know about web programming, so you've got to abstract


00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.020
that away as much as you can, as much as it makes sense.


00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.760
So that they're not daunted or it's not like, "Okay, now I'm really good at PyTorch and


00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.920
training all these things, and now I need to learn about servers and all that stuff."


00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.240
It's almost a different skill set for a lot of people.


00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.980
It really is.


00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.180
And the hand it off to somebody else, it's slow,


00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.140
but also it only works for certain situations.


00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.920
A lot of data scientists, I suspect,


00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.700
don't have a whole software team supporting them.


00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.820
As they need, right?


00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.300
They're the sole person at their company.


00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.540
So you said you had gone into statistics


00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.340
and found your way over to this side of that world.


00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.500
Do you feel like it's kind of a golden age for statisticians


00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.820
Now, because when I went to college, it's like, well, you could be an actuary or you


00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.580
could work at an insurance company, or maybe some other company might be interested in


00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.780
hiring somebody who does stats.


00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.020
You work at the, you know, US, statistics.


00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.820
Yeah, exactly.


00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.220
and that was kind of, and now with the kind of blending into data science, there's


00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.700
just, you know, it's so in demand.


00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.460
So many is like, the world is so open for that now.


00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.900
Yeah.


00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.100
Yeah.


00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.500
it definitely became a much sexier career.


00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.180
And I think I kind of got lucky that I kind of got into it


00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.200
like right as it was starting to take off.


00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.900
Like at that point, like data science


00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.000
wasn't really like a term yet.


00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.780
I'm not that old, but yeah, at that time it wasn't really,


00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.120
like there were like, I think at that point,


00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.180
like they were called like, it's like research scientists


00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.660
was more like the term, right?


00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.060
Which still kind of sounds a little bit dry,


00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.780
but then it got rebranded as data science.


00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.580
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a, I mean,


00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.460
I would say it's always a good time to study statistics.


00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.580
I think like a lot of people that, yeah, I think if someone were to come up to me and


00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.860
say like, I have no idea what I want to major in, but like I have some aptitude for math,


00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.140
I would say like major in statistics, I think it's like really useful.


00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.420
As like a lot of applications, but I think now also in terms of like, tech, I feel like


00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.300
definitely like it's sort of like the, it's the era of like the Renaissance person, right?


00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.700
Like you kind of have to know a little bit of everything now, right?


00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.700
Yeah, I do.


00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:36.820
stats, programming, math, like all these things are starting to like kind of blend together.


00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:43.140
And yeah, I think it's kind of, you know, like a lot of people really respect kind of like pull


00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.020
from all these disciplines, like seamlessly, right? And I think it's, yeah, I think that's


00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.060
kind of where we are now. - Yeah, it's a super fun time. If


00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:57.700
you're excited about always learning new things, and sort of bettering yourself and bringing in


00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.040
in this thing and mixing it that way.


00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.760
If you'd rather just kind of be done learning, maybe not so much.


00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.840
Absolutely.


00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.340
Yeah.


00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.920
Can't just show up for 20 years.


00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.820
It'd be okay.


00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.120
I guess if you were like maintaining code, well, the code, it would be okay, but not,


00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.240
not in the machine learning space and machine learning also is just crazy.


00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.280
We've got large language models just running loose everywhere now.


00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.600
What do you think about all that?


00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.000
Yeah.


00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.120
I mean, I think it's definitely like a very exciting time to be alive.


00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.400
I think it's pretty crazy that, you know, when I started, when I got started in ML,


00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.920
like six years ago, it was, it definitely was like very niche, right?


00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.840
And like the tools that people use and like the language about it kind of definitely did


00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.200
not penetrate the mainstream.


00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.640
But now, you know, it seems like, you know, like the technologies and the algorithms,


00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.440
the models, the data sets are all things that people talk about now, right?


00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.000
And I think we've all had an older relative ask us about, you know, ChatGPT, or, you


00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.720
know, like the latest trend or like, stable diffusion with the


00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.200
image, the AI image generation, I think it kind of has


00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.680
penetrated, you know, every part of society, I think part of,


00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.360
you know, I think like part of the reason why that is one,


00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.600
because like, one, like the technology is like way more


00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.800
impressive now, right? Like these algorithms are able to do


00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.000
things that were, you know, unimaginable, like 2017, right


00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.600
when I graduated college. But, but also, it's just like, these


00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.240
models are much easier to share and use now, right. And I think,


00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:29.640
I think part of the reason why ChatsVT took off so quickly was just the interface is so intuitive.


00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.920
We've been chatting with each other for decades over the internet, right?


00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:44.440
And the user interface is so simple and it kind of fits our mental model so quickly or so easily.


00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.120
But under the hood, it's this incredibly complex process, right?


00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.000
Right, right.


00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.960
Yeah. Right. And I think that's kind of like where tools like radio kind of come into play, right?


00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:59.560
It's just like, there's a bunch of like, incredible, like amazing research happening. But unless other


00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.040
people can, you know, use it, play with it, evaluate it, like, it's almost as if it like, it


00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.000
doesn't exist, right? And I think radio, yeah, really helps you create like a demo and app that


00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.720
other people can use and play with and evaluate your model. And then, you know, and then just


00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.160
like that, anyone can can use it, right? Like, you don't, you no longer have to be like a technical


00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.080
person. You know, you don't have to like Python some script or something and then like go


00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.760
to like a website, right? You just go to a website, right? You can just send someone


00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.520
a link and then they can play with this state of the art. It's pretty, pretty cool.


00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.280
You know, can you control a combo box and a button? Yeah, something like that, right?


00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:39.360
Yeah, then you're qualified. Yeah, it's wild. One of the things that surprises me is for


00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:48.440
such insane technology that leverages so many servers to ChatGPT and friends, the user


00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.360
interface for it is so mundane.


00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.640
I don't mean that as a derogatory term, but it's just like, well, you just talk to it


00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.320
in this text box and it just talks.


00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.360
There's not like a crazy new UI where you put on 3D glasses and where you just, it's


00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.040
just a chat box.


00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.280
But what it does is incredible.


00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.560
Similar for Midjourney and other things.


00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.880
You just slash imagine.


00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880
Just chat.


00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.880
Just chat with it.


00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:23.160
But so there's this sort of weird paradox of like this incredible simple way to interact


00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.160
with it.


00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.040
And yet what it does is, I guess it's a natural way to interact with it, which is what's surprising.


00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.040
Yeah.


00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.200
- Yeah, I mean, I think that part of the reason,


00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.160
I think it's just like the natural language interface,


00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.880
I think a lot of people resonate with that.


00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.520
I think you don't have to explain it, right?


00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.400
You just type something and then it'll respond, right?


00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.280
Like it won't error, right?


00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.000
And I think, even like stuff


00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.440
that isn't just purely chat-based, I think,


00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.240
like stable diffusion, like the web UI, right?


00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.520
I think it has a lot of controls, right?


00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.360
But at the end of the day,


00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.760
it's kind of like a Photoshop-esque interface, right?


00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.160
It's like someone who's used to that kind of software like it's kind of what they expect


00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.000
where you like upload an image and then you like, you know, you can like


00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.360
Get a tool to like blur something out and then like, you know, you can in paint it or out paint it


00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.680
and stuff like that, so


00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.680
yeah, I think like the


00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.560
You know, I forgot who said it but I think some you know, someone said that like, you know


00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.920
MLS like it's like not really like the product. It's like the


00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.200
It's kind of like in the background right like, you know


00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.200
like the most successful ML products,


00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.960
like don't really feel like they're ML, right?


00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.120
It's kind of like the ML is kind of like abstracted away


00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.960
and it just makes your experience like that much better.


00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.600
Right. And I think that's kind of what all these different


00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.160
tools are showing.


00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.480
- Amazing.


00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.760
All right. So let's talk about Gradio


00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.840
and I'm gonna ask you to do something a little bit funky


00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.880
to kick this off, but let's talk about with just like


00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.040
what other apps are like Gradio.


00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.080
So things that come to mind for me are like StreamYard,


00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.520
for example, so I sort of made stream I'm reading the words of


00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.040
our app that we're using stream let not stream yard, streamlet


00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.980
and other give people a sense of like, what are what are the


00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.720
categories of apps that's kind of in the same space so they can


00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.320
get a mental model for what radio? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. So


00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.720
I think like streamlet is a good comparison. Like plotly dash, I


00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.720
I think is also like in the same ecosystem,


00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.920
you know, Shiny, if you know, I think.


00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.840
- Shiny, yeah.


00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.680
- Yeah, I think like the first--


00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.680
- I just had Joe on to talk about Shiny for Python.


00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.520
- Yeah.


00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.340
- Recently, yeah.


00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.180
- Oh, no way.


00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.200
Yeah, I think it's kind of like, yeah,


00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.720
they're all definitely in the same ecosystem, right?


00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.320
And I think, you know, if you go to the Gradio homepage,


00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.240
like, you know, gradio.app, right?


00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.240
You can kind of see some of the apps


00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.040
that you can build with Gradio really quickly.


00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.840
But that, yeah, but that doesn't necessarily limit,


00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.160
like what you see on the landing page


00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.520
is not all that you can build with Gradio.


00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.220
I think those are just like the eye-catching quick examples


00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.880
just because, you know, like I said,


00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.600
like Gradio's kind of built to get these kind of examples


00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.640
up and running really quickly,


00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.400
but you can do like lots of complex stuff with Gradio.


00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.840
- Excellent, yeah, so we'll, let's dive into it.


00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.840
So you've already given it a bit of a introduction for us.


00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.680
Maybe we could, let's see, maybe we could work on,


00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.480
just start by discussing how you might take,


00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.360
you've got some different types of problems


00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.520
you can solve on your homepage,


00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.600
and it shows you the code, the entire code,


00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.480
and then the UI that comes out of it.


00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.760
So maybe you could just talk us through


00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.800
the sketch recognition, it's one of the types of UIs


00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.640
you could build here.


00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.360
So sketch recognition, you just kind of draw,


00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.040
that's definitely a bird I drew there,


00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.720
or a mountain, I'm not sure.


00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.880
It could be either. Yeah, but I guess, you know, the, how do you


00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.640
think about how do you think about radio? So radio is a, you


00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.280
know, at the Python library, right? Python is the main


00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.560
language used to interface or to build radio apps.


00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.040
PIP install radio.


00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.120
Yeah, you install radio, right? And then what does radio do at


00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.520
the highest level radio turns a Python function, any Python


00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.800
function into a interactive web app. Right. So when you think of


00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:17.760
function, right, function has inputs and outputs. So, in, so


00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.400
these inputs correspond, these inputs and outputs correspond to


00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.960
things that will be drawn on the page, right, and Gradio comes


00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.360
with a standard set of inputs, right, there's like text boxes,


00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.240
drop downs, you know, number fields, data frames, you know,


00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.480
plots, anything like that, but also like drawing tools like a


00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.320
sketchpad. And then the output, you know, it can be, you know,


00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.560
It can be any of these other components, but it could also be like a label, right, to show


00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.160
like a machine learning prediction.


00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:49.640
Right, so all you need to do is take, you know, write a plain Python function that takes


00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.080
in a drawing and returns a set of probabilities or competences.


00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.040
And then Gradio can kind of wrap that in one line of code and turned it into an interactive


00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040
web app.


00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.360
Like, you know, like we see here, if you're on the YouTube stream, you can kind of see


00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.320
what Michael is doing, you know, there's like a sketch pad area, and then he can kind of


00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.320
scribble on it and then immediately he'll get a prediction out.


00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.320
- Yeah, let's see if I can draw an owl, maybe.


00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.320
Let's see how I do.


00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.320
- I don't know, yeah, syringe. We've got to make the model better, right?


00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.320
- It could be a cat. It definitely could be a cat.


00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.320
- I can see that. - I think I've got to make my drawing better.


00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.320
So the idea is you have a regular function


00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.640
that takes the inputs and outputs.


00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.200
There's no UI whatsoever.


00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.320
And there's also no reactive programming.


00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.200
You're not hooking events where I redraw and it just reruns.


00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.040
That's not part of my code I write as a Python person.


00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.840
And then you just say gr.interface,


00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.360
give it the function, and then you say the inputs are--


00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.520
in this case, you say it's just a sketchpad.


00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.320
And so I get this UI that I can draw on,


00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.200
that I've been attempting to draw an owl on.


00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.480
It's probably missing the eyes.


00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.480
I think it's the eyes that are missing.


00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.340
- Ladder. - Now it's a ladder.


00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:11.740
It's not about protesting the underlying model, is it?


00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.280
And then you say the outputs in our label.


00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.320
Now a lot of UIs, people might think a label


00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.460
is just a non-interactive piece of text,


00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.320
but here there's more of a machine learning label, right?


00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.320
You've got like a cool horizontal bar graph


00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.440
that has percentages and talks about its guesses.


00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.440
- So it's like a machine learning labeled response report,


00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.920
not just a cat.


00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.800
- Exactly, yeah.


00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.280
I think a machine learning person,


00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.320
when they see label, they kind of think this, right?


00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.320
They don't think of the standard web,


00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.360
just like a text box, right?


00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.360
- Yeah, like label four type of thing.


00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.120
- Right, so that's one of the things that,


00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.360
or one of the ways that Gradio


00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.120
kind of like is built for that kind of audience, right?


00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.840
It's like the high level primitives


00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.040
to kind of match that mental model, right?


00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.560
And then, yeah, so like one thing you mentioned earlier


00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.880
is that there's no like explicit reactivity


00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.800
that you as a programmer have to write.


00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.760
That's definitely true in the gr.interface case.


00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.160
Gr.interface kind of like abstracts all that away from you,


00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.000
but Gradle also--


00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.320
- So this is your simple case,


00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.000
like I just want, just run this function


00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.080
with these inputs and outputs


00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.200
and I want a real basic variant, okay?


00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.760
- Right, and then Gradle also offers like a lower level API


00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.560
where you can kind of like explicitly control the layout,


00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.760
So right now everything is like side by side.


00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.200
You can put them horizontally across columns, rows, you can add components, right?


00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:40.360
And then you can also, you know, be more explicit in saying like, okay, when this input changes,


00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.640
run this function and then that will populate this and stuff like that.


00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.320
And you can kind of change these things together.


00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:52.840
So yeah, but maybe it's expensive to generate some portion and you want to cache it as much


00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.840
as possible.


00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.840
Right.


00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:01.440
Or yeah, you just want to like be have like more control over like exactly what happens when when things change, right?


00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.920
You could be able to give you that that control but for a lot of use cases you can get you know


00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:12.480
You can get really far with your that interface and then the other companion piece which isn't on the landing page because we just we just


00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.140
Released it, you know, maybe like two weeks ago. It's dr. Chat interface, right?


00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.920
So you could build like I'll address it to an LM or something. Yeah, you can build a chat UI


00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.600
For like yeah like an LLM


00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.000
you know, just in one line of code.


00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.320
And I think, you know, I can try to maybe find an example of that real quick.


00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:38.200
- Sure. Yeah, while you're looking, do you offer any guidance or any opinionated


00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.440
stuff on which LLM to choose? Or do you just say...


00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.320
- Any...


00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.120
- It's just a chat interface and you write the code to make it happen?


00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.520
- Yeah, yeah. You just write the code to...yeah, just like, given the message,


00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.720
what should the response be? And then...


00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.240
- Right.


00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.080
- Yeah.


00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.080
- That's the interface.


00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.440
Yeah, and then, you know.


00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.560
- There's some interesting options people might want to pick.


00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.640
Obviously you could pick open AI and use their API,


00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.600
but there's things like private GPT,


00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.240
which allows you to ask questions about your documents,


00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.680
but 100% private, right?


00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.760
You could just like give it, you know,


00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.720
hundreds of docs and say, learn these,


00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.880
and we're gonna talk to you about it, you know,


00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.640
or something along those lines.


00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.040
There's the Lang chain, right?


00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.720
- Yeah, there's, yeah.


00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.920
- Which is a pretty interesting option.


00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.760
- There's a--


00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.760
- These things.


00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.720
- Llama, like the new Llama 2.


00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.000
- Yeah, the Llama 2.


00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.440
- Yeah, so I think in the chat,


00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.080
I just posted like a great Llama 2 UI that we can show.


00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.240
- Yes. - And it's on Hugging Face.


00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.960
So I think we can kind of talk about


00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.840
the hosting on Hugging Face as well.


00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.360
- Yeah, okay.


00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.840
- Yeah, so this is the chat UI.


00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.000
So it's, you know, if you were to scroll down a little bit,


00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.840
it's just, it's kind of like a--


00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.120
- The UI says chat bot.


00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.280
I can type a message.


00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.120
- Yeah.


00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.040
- I'll ask it what the podcast is.


00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.120
Hey, I'm here to help you.


00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.600
Talk Python is a podcast and community dedicated


00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.760
to helping developers improve their skills,


00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.360
interviews and experts in the field.


00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.560
That's you, Freddy.


00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.440
And resources, yeah, what do you wanna know?


00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.520
- Yeah, so under the hood,


00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:18.520
this is using LLAMA2, 70 billion LLM.


00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.920
- Nice, I can ask what the latest episode is.


00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.580
So it gives me a sense how far back it goes.


00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.740
That's about two years old.


00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.580
So, okay.


00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.700
- Yeah, it makes sense.


00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:31.140
- Oh wait, no, this is not so sure about that.


00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.660
Yeah, I think there's a little bit of a mismatch,


00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.500
but anyway, this is really cool.


00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.860
So you basically plug in whatever LLM you want to


00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.820
into this and they put the, or you put the LLM too.


00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.640
- Exactly, yeah.


00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.460
And then if you go, you know,


00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.980
If you scroll up a little bit in the website,


00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.980
if you see those three bars, I think.


00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.340
- Yeah, the hamburger deal.


00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.100
- Oh, no, no, sorry, that's not it.


00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.340
And where is it?


00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.180
It's in, oh.


00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.100
- There are three dots, maybe?


00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.760
- Oh, I guess maybe because you don't have an account,


00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.660
you can't see the file.


00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.260
Oh, yeah, if you go to files, there, if you go to files,


00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.660
and go to app.py, this is the source code


00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.380
of the Gradle demo.


00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.600
If you scroll down, so this is kind of just like the helper text and


00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.620
then this is the actual prediction function, it's about 20 lines of code.


00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.420
But if you scroll down, you see the chat interface code.


00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:32.700
>> There you go, with GR blocks as data, create a tab.


00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.500
>> And then, but yeah, the important thing is that GR chat interface is just


00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.620
it's just like a one line way to create a chat bot.


00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.980
It works similarly to the interface case, right?


00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.140
There's just a function in this case that it's an LLM, so


00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.460
So it handles like the responding to each user message.


00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.500
And then you just call that and then you can kind of call launch and


00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.900
then you get a UI.


00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.900
Yeah, so it's- >> Nice.


00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.580
>> Yeah, so you get like a chat to BTS UI and in this case,


00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:06.380
it's 100 lines of code, but yeah, pretty simple.


00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:10.180
>> That is simple, and one of the things that's pretty cool here is for


00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:15.180
the chat section, you hook it to the type you set up


00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:21.220
is a streaming type versus the place I type is a batch.


00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.860
And then the function you give it is a generator


00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.000
with yield keyword.


00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.260
So it just, as you go through it,


00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.580
it makes choices and sends them back.


00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.420
That's a pretty advanced interaction


00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.460
for the UI to be, to run in like that.


00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.300
That's cool.


00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.120
- Yeah, yeah.


00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.480
So I think it's, you know, in order to get streaming,


00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.160
like there's no special syntax.


00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.040
You can just use the normal Python yield


00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.880
and then Grado knows how to like, you know,


00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.120
feed that iteratively, you know,


00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.400
feed that to the front end


00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.840
and then you get like this responsive streaming UI.


00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.340
That's a really good call out.


00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.080
Yeah, so it's just kind of like the, you know,


00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.360
Grado tries to use like the core Python syntax


00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.680
and the core Python data types as much as possible.


00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.480
Just so to make it easier for people to get up and running.


00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.640
- So I just blew through this really quickly here,


00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.160
But basically, from what I can tell,


00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.160
is the amount of code here to actually implement this


00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.300
that is not just the details of giving this text,


00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:23.300
make the LLM do the thing, is five lines of code.


00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.400
- Yeah.


00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.220
- Yeah.


00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.960
- Yeah, that's definitely true.


00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.960
- That should make people pretty excited about like,


00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.920
hey, I can write five lines of code,


00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.880
especially with an example to work from.


00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.720
- Exactly, yeah.


00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.840
So yeah, definitely we need to get chat interface


00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.120
up in the landing page.


00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.560
but yeah, I think it's super easy to get complex demos,


00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.840
you know, running and think it's just a handful lines of code.


00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.680
- Yeah.


00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.800
We mentioned Shiny a little bit.


00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.440
Umar asks, how does it compare to Shiny?


00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.680
How familiar with Shiny?


00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.720
Can you?


00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.400
- I'm not super familiar.


00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.240
No.


00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.560
- Yeah, I'm obviously not familiar.


00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.500
I'm familiar with Shiny,


00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.520
but not well enough to compare it directly to Gradio either.


00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.600
I mean, they live in the same general world


00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.720
of trying to kind of create a UI


00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.440
that's, you don't have to write web apps for.


00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.800
But I don't think they're totally the same,


00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.620
but they're similar.


00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:19.620
Okay, so we talked about setting up pip install, that's easy.


00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:24.680
You say you can choose from a variety of interface types.


00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.640
These are the widgets that you're talking about, right?


00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.120
- Yeah, exactly, yeah.


00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.200
Yeah, so you could, like,


00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.080
in terms of like the inputs and the outputs,


00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.960
you know, we call them components,


00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.560
but yeah, there's, if you go to the docs page,


00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.720
which is about, we have about 30-something components.


00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.840
Yeah, so you know, code, buttons, data frames,


00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.180
plots, files, pretty much like name it.


00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.600
And we're adding components all the time.


00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.980
And we're also, one of the things that we're gonna work on


00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.400
is letting the community create their own components.


00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.120
So like if you have your own particular demo,


00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.980
your own particular web app, and you want this new component


00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.000
that we don't support, like how do you,


00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.160
we're working to make it easy for you to do that


00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.400
without having to merge something into a 3DO upstream,


00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.560
and then other people can play with it.


00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.220
So we're working on that as well.


00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.320
But for the time being, it's yeah,


00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.000
about these like 30 something components.


00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.360
And then yeah, you can mix and match them


00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.600
however you want.


00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.240
- You've got quite a bit of them.


00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.680
Many of them I expect people would imagine.


00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.800
So you've got button.


00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:32.120
Let's see, you've got data frame, which is pretty cool.


00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.280
And then gallery image. - The plots.


00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.160
The plots, like the line plot, scatter plot,


00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.000
those are all pretty cool.


00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.200
But you've also got things like audio.


00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.240
What's the story with audio?


00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.880
This is how you--


00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.880
- Yeah, you can upload like an MP3 or a WAV file directly.


00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.120
- Maybe for transcripts or sentiment analysis or something.


00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.120
- Exactly, like Whisper, essentially like audio transcription


00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.960
or also just synthetic audio, right?


00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.040
So there's like a bark and there's all these


00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.280
like kind of like machine learning demos


00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.800
they go text to speech basically,


00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.480
and they're really advanced.


00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.680
So if you wanted to display that,


00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.320
right, like you ingest text, come out with audio,


00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.240
like you can use like an audio output component,


00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.440
and then you get like a, yeah, you get like a,


00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.160
you can play the audio directly in the browser.


00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.000
- Okay, I got it.


00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.800
So it's like a, it's just like an audio tag in HTML,


00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.900
but obviously it does more from the UI, I'm sure,


00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.480
but it's to not just, I guess you would just do file


00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.800
if you really wanted to drop an MP3,


00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.280
but if you wanted to generate audio


00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.640
and let people see the results,


00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.960
then this audio thing would be the way to go.


00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.120
- Yeah, and then you could also,


00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.920
the audio could also be like the input, right?


00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.560
You could just drag and drop, but you know,


00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.120
if you click on that box,


00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.480
it'll let you upload an audio if you have it,


00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.800
and then you could-- - Interesting.


00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.720
- You could play it. - I'm sure I have some audio.


00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.640
- Yeah.


00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.040
- I know that I have some, but how,


00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.360
let's see if I can find something to upload here.


00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.920
Here, I'll upload a sponsor.


00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.720
Here, let me find one.


00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.660
Yeah, this is super short.


00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.620
So I can upload, yeah, look at that.


00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.120
And it just becomes a player, excellent.


00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.960
- And you can play it,


00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.300
and then you can also edit it as well.


00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.940
So you see that little pencil?


00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.940
You could like kind of trim it.


00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.940
- Oh, I could do like trim it to make it shorter.


00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.580
- Yeah, yeah.


00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.100
So, yeah, lots of cool components like that,


00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.700
that we have, you know.


00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.220
Yeah, all the standard form stuff,


00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.780
like sliders and dropdowns and yeah,


00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.780
like highlighted text.


00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.180
And, you know, yeah, so the standard like form stuff,


00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.900
but then there's also like complex, you know,


00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.140
not complex, but more maybe domain specific ML stuff.


00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.500
So like highlighted text, for example,


00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.180
like really big and like part of speech tagging,


00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.180
like NLP, right?


00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.740
So you can kind of get like a highlighted,


00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.300
it's like, depending on the tag that you apply


00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.540
to each word in the text,


00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.820
you'd get like different coloring and stuff like that.


00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.220
Yeah, so it's, you know, for MLP, like model 3D.


00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.500
So there's a lot of ML demos that come out


00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.860
that you can generate model 3D assets directly.


00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.940
So this lets you display them as well.


00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.220
So yeah, so everywhere-- we have everything


00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.700
from the most basic general web app stuff,


00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:20.420
kind of domain-specific machine learning components as well.


00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.420
- Yeah, let's see what else jumps out here.


00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.080
We have video as well, which is pretty cool.


00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.520
JSON, yeah, there's a lot of what you can type in.


00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.360
JSON, I guess it probably validates it


00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.160
and auto-formats it or something,


00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.000
rather than just--


00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.120
- Yeah, when you return the JSON,


00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.840
it highlights it for you.


00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.400
You can copy it directly as well.


00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.840
- Okay, so when we were talking about


00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.520
the Gradio.interface thing,


00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.160
it had, well, here's an input and here's an output.


00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.920
It's plural.


00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.120
- So could you have, could I say there's a sketch pad


00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.600
and a text box?


00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.440
- Yeah.


00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.080
- As input and then the outputs are, I don't know,


00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.440
three other things and.


00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.520
- Yeah, that's a really good observation.


00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.280
Yeah, so you can have more than one input,


00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.440
more than one output for sure, right?


00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.120
So like if you go to the,


00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.360
I think the time series forecasting demo,


00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.560
I think that one has like two inputs.


00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.880
- That's also on the homepage, yeah.


00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.400
- Also on the homepage, right?


00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.360
So you can pick like, you know, it's like a toy example,


00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.700
like forecasting, your PyPy installs,


00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.900
but you could pick, here has two inputs, right?


00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.020
Like the time horizon and the library itself,


00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.540
both of them are drop downs, right?


00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.200
And then when either updates, the plot updates, right?


00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.020
So there's also like how you can do plotting in Gradio.


00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.740
And then also this is interesting,


00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:46.380
this demo is built with like the lower level API.


00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.040
You could build it with interface if you wanted to,


00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.620
but just as an example,


00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.540
it's built with like the lower level API.


00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.620
- Cool.


00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.540
- Yeah, so I guess there's probably a library


00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.760
and time span to arguments to the function that you write.


00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.860
And then just as you interact with these widgets,


00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.100
it just recalls it with whatever the values are.


00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.820
- Exactly, and then the function itself returns a plot.


00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.420
So in this case, it's a plotly plot, right?


00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:16.380
So by default, we ship with support for matplotlib,


00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:20.580
plotly, bokeh, and alter.


00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.620
- I see, so if I would create like a matplotlib object,


00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.300
do all the stuff to it that I would do in a notebook.


00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.900
Instead of calling show, I just return it from my function


00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.500
and then it becomes part of the UI.


00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.700
- Yep.


00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.980
- Okay, yeah, that seems pretty straightforward.


00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:35.980
- Yeah.


00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.940
- And this one happens to be done with profit


00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.420
at time series library.


00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.460
Yeah, you've got integration with a bunch of cool


00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.260
machine learning libraries here as well.


00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.500
- Yeah, yeah, so the cool thing is,


00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.380
you know, pretty much if you can write a Python function


00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.580
for it, like it'll work with radio.


00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.460
Like there really doesn't need to be,


00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.420
you know, like us as the development teams


00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.980
don't really need to build that many integrations to get anything that you're working with to


00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:04.740
work with Gradio. Pretty much if you can call a bread and butter function to do it, and


00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:09.260
we have like the supported output types and stuff like that, you can display it with Gradio.


00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:15.940
Yeah. So yeah, there's a couple of demos, for example, like connecting to like databases


00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.900
and stuff. You can connect to S3 if you want.


00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.900
Oh, interesting.


00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.500
Like you're not, I don't know exactly where they are now.


00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.340
- Yeah, like this.


00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.160
- It's gotta be one.


00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.000
- Yeah.


00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.660
- It looks like it might be one potentially.


00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:29.980
Now, I'll click to find some S3 stuff.


00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.100
Here's, yeah, there's gotta be something here somewhere.


00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.780
Yeah, very cool.


00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.940
So one of the things people may be wondering,


00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.020
and the fact that I don't see a pricing up at the top,


00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.900
it might be a big hint here.


00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.380
What's the business model?


00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.540
What's the story with this?


00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.980
Is this just straight open source?


00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.140
Is it a open core?


00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.820
What's the story around your project?


00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.540
- Yeah, so Gradio is completely open source


00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.180
and you can host it anywhere.


00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.740
So you're not tied into any platform.


00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.700
Gradio did get acquired by Hugging Face


00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.460
maybe like almost two years ago.


00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.620
So Gradio integrates really tightly


00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.640
with the Hugging Face ecosystem.


00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.820
But all those integrations are normally free.


00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:25.820
So for example, you could host radio demos on Hugging Face.


00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.420
- Hugging Face spaces or something.


00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.540
- Yeah, on Hugging Face spaces, right?


00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.900
And then if your demo needs special hardware


00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.780
or stuff like that, you could pay Hugging Face


00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.700
to provision that for you.


00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.380
But you're not paying for the radio, right?


00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.820
You can, it's kind of like, you could use whatever you want


00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.580
on Hugging Face spaces now, right?


00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.220
It doesn't have the radio. - Excellent.


00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.380
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, so it's


00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.700
freely available.


00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.920
So it's completely open source with a kind of a Gradio


00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.380
as a service via Hugging Space.


00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.740
Hugging Space, yeah.


00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.460
Yeah, on their spaces.


00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.460
Say that fast a bunch of times.


00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.580
So yeah, really cool.


00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.740
One of the things people might not


00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.280
know if they haven't heard of Gradio


00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:12.900
before is if you go to your GitHub repo for it,


00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.060
almost 21,000 GitHub stars.


00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:21.280
That's some serious bit of attention that it's gotten.


00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.640
Yeah, definitely.


00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.880
We've seen a lot of growth in the last year and a half,


00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.880
ever since the Hugging Face acquisition.


00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.280
That's really helped us put the library


00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.560
in front of a new audience.


00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.120
And as well, with the recent advances in ML,


00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.160
people want to build demos for ML models now.


00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.080
So I think that's definitely helping Gradio as well.


00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.540
- Yeah.


00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.680
I'm trying to give people a sense of scale.


00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.520
This is like a third of FastAPI, third of Flask.


00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.500
Like that's a lot.


00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.520
That's a lot of people using this.


00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.840
So the reason I'm bringing that up is


00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.440
it's not some brand new thing that you came up with


00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.240
that seems kind of neat that maybe people could try,


00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.400
but it's got a lot of users, right?


00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.920
- Yeah, yeah, I think month to month,


00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.200
we're seeing like hundreds of thousands of people


00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.160
building these Gradio demos, repeatedly.


00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.080
So yeah, definitely a lot of growth.


00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.760
And yeah, Gradio is about five years old now, so it's not.


00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.000
- Awesome, congrats, that's really cool.


00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:29.840
- That's nothing new.


00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.480
- Yeah, 3.9, almost 4 million monthly downloads.


00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.440
- Yeah.


00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.040
- That's a decent chunk.


00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.520
All right, what do we think about,


00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.320
I don't want to do an image in one.


00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.040
So you can do other demos.


00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.240
You've got here, you've got time series forecasting.


00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.720
We talked about that as the multiple inputs.


00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.080
XGBoost with explainability.


00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.960
You want to tell us about this a little bit?


00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.800
- Right, yeah.


00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.320
So this is kind of, this one also I think has like,


00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.920
you know, this one has like 12 inputs, right?


00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.440
And the idea is, you know, like,


00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.360
it's one of like these like kind of Kaggle-esque things


00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.240
where you're like predicting income based on,


00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.160
you know, a slew of predictors.


00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:14.160
Right. And then like the cool thing is that, you know, this isn't explicitly built into


00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.360
Gradle or yeah, this isn't explicitly built into Gradle, but you could you kind of hook


00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:24.040
into the shop really easily, right? So if you hit explain, it'll, it'll, it'll try to


00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:29.600
explain the prediction of the model and display it in a plot for you. Right. So, right. So


00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.160
for those of you don't know, like shop is like this algorithm for explaining you know,


00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.600
the predictions of like any machine learning model. And in this case, it's hooked, it's


00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.840
it's hooking into XGBoost, right?


00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.200
But there isn't like an explicit, you know,


00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.560
in this demo, there isn't like an explicit radio feature


00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.400
that's being used.


00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.740
It's just kind of calling Shep directly


00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.920
from this Python function


00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.340
and then displaying the results as a plot.


00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.560
So you can kind of, yeah.


00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.080
- Yeah, so what people, what this thing does


00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.360
is it's got a bunch of different sliders and dropdowns.


00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:03.360
It says, given an age, your education level,


00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.160
years of school, whether you're married or not,


00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.840
all those male, female, how many hours a week you work,


00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.280
and then it predicts, what is this like?


00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.920
Yeah, predicts your yearly income.


00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.220
And then this thing you're talking about


00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.580
is with that model, you can ask it,


00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.100
okay, well, of all these different things


00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.860
we could put into it, what features,


00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.320
what aspects of that are more important


00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.000
and what are less important, right?


00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.080
- Right.


00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.920
- Okay, so right. - Exactly, right.


00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.960
And then, yeah, so, you know, like the use cases,


00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.640
you know, let's say like you are a data scientist that, you


00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:40.600
know, is charged with building this kind of model. You know,


00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.500
the first question after someone seeing the prediction is, you


00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.320
know, someone might have like, why, like, why is it? Right.


00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.640
And then, you know, you ideally want to like be able to explain


00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.920
exactly what, what element of the predictors contributed to


00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.640
the prediction the most. And there's a lot of tools that you


00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.520
can use for that, right? Shab is, I think, like the most


00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:05.120
well known to my to my understanding. And then, yeah, and then you can kind of just with radio


00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.760
really easily just like, call that algorithm and then just display it in a plot, right. And then,


00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.840
you know, in this example, like one of the inputs is like the capital gain, so like how much you


00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.000
make on your investments, right. So and I think in this particular case, like the capital gain is


00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.920
a really big, right. So obviously, like, because the capital gain is so big, in this particular


00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.840
case, we predict that the income will be really big, right, because capital gain is pretty much,


00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.280
and it's kind of synonymous with income really.


00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.920
So yeah, so that's kind of what this is showing.


00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.320
But yeah.


00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.560
- Yeah, and I suspect this is important


00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.120
for a lot of reasons.


00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.160
You know, if you're building this for your company


00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.760
or for some kind of project,


00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.640
people wanna know, well, we have all these different inputs.


00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.900
What ones actually matter in making a prediction?


00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.600
Maybe only the top three are the ones that really matter


00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.520
and you can throw out things like marital status.


00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.880
Like it actually doesn't make much of a difference, right?


00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.300
Or if you're a policy person and you know this model


00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.520
actually matches real data, you could say,


00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.000
well, we're trying to improve the policy


00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.880
for a certain group of people.


00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.600
We could focus on any of these aspects,


00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.960
which one or two would make the biggest return


00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.240
for our effort to make a change, right?


00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.520
There's a lot of cool stuff that comes out of this, I think.


00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.160
- Yeah, no, absolutely.


00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.600
And then like you as a developer, I think it's,


00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.560
you know, it's like the data scientist, right?


00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.940
It's really easy to make this kind of thing, right?


00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.400
Like this is like a GR interface, I believe, right?


00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.400
So this is just one line of code to build this.


00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.000
- Yeah, let's see here.


00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:35.840
- I don't know, I think it's more.


00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.640
Yeah, so it's not- - Somewhere.


00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.880
Oh, it's the other one.


00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.800
- Yeah, it's not GR.interface.


00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.040
You know, the other API that we can talk about now


00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.520
is called blocks.


00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.360
But yeah, you can kind of- - Yeah, tell us about that.


00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.400
- Yeah, so yeah, the way that it works


00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.080
is that you declaratively define your UI, right?


00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.640
So it's like this input is going to go in this column,


00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.000
and you can kind of say, well, this input is a dropdown,


00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.800
for example, right?


00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.800
So in this example, there's lots of dropdown components,


00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.000
lots of sliders for the age and stuff like that.


00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.400
And then you kind of define all these components.


00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.240
And then you can kind of define the reactivity separately.


00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.960
So if you were to scroll down, you'll


00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.120
see there should be a button dot click, right?


00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.640
So whenever the predict button gets clicked, yeah,


00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.360
So you call this function with these inputs


00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.140
and then return this one thing.


00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.760
So that's kind of like the model, right?


00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.320
Right now it kind of looks like a lot of code


00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.160
just 'cause there's a lot of inputs and stuff,


00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.220
but at the end of the day, it's pretty simple.


00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.920
You're just defining a UI and then you define


00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.460
what happens when and then Gradle handles the rest.


00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.240
- Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.


00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.760
So people listen, basically the UI


00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.040
for the more advanced version is you use context managers,


00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.840
you create with blocks.


00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.320
So then you'd say, here's something that goes across


00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.280
and with another row, put some columns in there


00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.120
with another row, and then that's kind of


00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:54.960
how you build it up.


00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.560
So it's pretty straightforward.


00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.040
You know what it reminds me of a little bit


00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.300
is it reminds me a little of Flutter.


00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.320
Are you familiar with how Flutter looks?


00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.160
- No.


00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:05.980
- And the code.


00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:10.320
I don't know if I can find a quick example,


00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:15.320
but how about an example Flutter?


00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.820
Come on.


00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:27.820
It's really sort of hierarchical, so the thing that I think is interesting is the code


00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:35.380
hierarchy matches the sort of UI hierarchy.


00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:41.460
So it's kind of a code-driven UI, where as it gets more indented, that talks about, "Okay,


00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:46.260
well that's a row," and then you kind of pop off and stuff.


00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.020
It's real similar in that sense that it's kind of all right there in the code.


00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.220
There's not a designer or a markup language or something like that.


00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.220
But yeah, pretty cool.


00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.220
Yeah.


00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.220
Yeah.


00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.220
So like the UI, it's all declarative.


00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:58.220
Right.


00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.780
So yeah, like you said, you just kind of say like, this is this row.


00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:06.180
And then yeah, there's ways to control like the relative width of each of these columns,


00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.180
for example.


00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.060
So if you wanted that, you could.


00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:13.300
And then another thing I saw, I can't remember what you demo is, I'm not going to pull it


00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:17.660
But I saw that there's a way to pass like CSS


00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.260
and styling over as well.


00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.180
Is that right?


00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.460
- Yeah, so there's a-- - That was my first thing.


00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:26.100
- Yeah, so there's like a Python API


00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.260
for like defining the theme, right?


00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.460
So like every UI element has certain CSS variables


00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.060
and you can control their value


00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:37.740
via like the values of this Python class


00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.780
that you then pass to your Gradle instance.


00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.740
But at the same time, there's like a top level CSS parameter


00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.500
that you could kind of, you know,


00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.300
you can kind of do whatever you want in that case.


00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.140
Like you don't have to use like the Python API


00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.180
if you don't want to, like,


00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.860
if there's something different that you want to change,


00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.860
you can change, you know, via these CSS variables.


00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.540
- Okay, so you're saying I could do something like,


00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.100
in Python, I could say, well,


00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:06.220
the style is button border width is three


00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.340
and the color of the border is blue.


00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.700
but if I just wanna have arbitrary CSS,


00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.740
I can just go, here's your arbitrary CSS string,


00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:13.580
go with that.


00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.220
- Yeah, you could pass it a file


00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:16.780
and then like it'll, we'll read that file


00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.300
and then use that CSS in the demo.


00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.380
Yeah, and then with that,


00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.300
you can also kind of like add IDs


00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.500
to each of the UI elements.


00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.300
And then, you know, you could write your CSS


00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.120
to target the IDs that you add, right?


00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.740
So like, let's say like you only wanted to modify


00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.580
like one button, you could do it that way.


00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:41.100
>> Right, you just want to control one of the plots or something.


00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:46.340
I guess if you're writing arbitrary code to return things like matplotlib plots,


00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:50.380
you could do things like the XKCD matplotlib.


00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:53.180
>> Yeah, for sure.


00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.340
>> Right, like you could control, I mean, I'm kind of joking, but


00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.820
it's also awesome.


00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:58.540
But- >> No, I mean,


00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.740
there's an XKCD radio theme, right?


00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.660
So you can, let me show you.


00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.580
>> There it is.


00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.900
>> Yeah.


00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:09.220
>> That takes it to another level. That's pretty excellent.


00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:13.380
>> Yeah. That's a cool thing about the theming is that it's shareable.


00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:16.940
Someone built this XKCD theme.


00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.900
Then anyone can use this in their Gradio demo.


00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.500
All you have to do is pass theme equals gstaff/xkcd,


00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.020
and then your demo will look like the XKCD theme.


00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.940
>> It's so good. I love it.


00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:30.420
>> Yeah.


00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.660
>> Oh my gosh. This is wild.


00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.140
- Yeah, completely community driven.


00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.580
So.


00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.980
- Yeah, well done to whoever did this one.


00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:39.980
That's really cool.


00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.660
Yeah, I like it.


00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.820
- Yeah, so if you, yeah, so it goes beyond the plot, right?


00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.980
You could for sure return a plot in the XKCD theme,


00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.220
but you could also have the whole demo in the XKCD theme.


00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.820
- You know, I often pull this example of this theme,


00:44:55.820 --> 00:45:00.420
this XKCD thing for Matplotlib because it's fun,


00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:05.100
But also I think there's genuine value in putting together


00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.980
something that looks like this.


00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.820
Because if you show this to decision makers,


00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:13.860
you know, bosses, managers, types,


00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.220
and they see that they look at something


00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.780
that looks like it's working and they're like,


00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.060
oh, well, we're done then.


00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:21.100
Like, no, no, no, we have two months more work.


00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.100
We're not done.


00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.820
But I click the button and it's giving me answers.


00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.180
We're really not done.


00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.260
You know, it's not scalable.


00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.400
It's not this, it's not that, right?


00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.800
It's only an estimate.


00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.720
But if you put just an XKCD front end on it,


00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.600
you're like, look, you see it's not done.


00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.040
It's just, it's got squiggly lines, hand drawn.


00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.560
It's clearly a prototype.


00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.400
Like, oh yeah, okay.


00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.800
But I could see where this is going.


00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.040
I think actually psychologically,


00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.480
it may have a big impact, even though it's silly.


00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.600
- Yeah, it's a super interesting point.


00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.520
Never thought about it that way.


00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.200
But yeah, I mean, I think it definitely gives it


00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:54.160
a little bit more like, you know, like sketch vibes.


00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.000
You know, like this is kind of like-


00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.960
- Yeah, yeah, like a wireframe vibe, yeah.


00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.080
- Yeah, wireframe, like straight from the workshop.


00:45:59.080 --> 00:45:59.920
Like, yeah.


00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.840
- Exactly, yeah.


00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.040
And that's what I was thinking,


00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.640
'cause I presented projects to various stakeholders


00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.000
when I used to do that kind of stuff.


00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.480
And they'd be like, "Oh, well, that looks like


00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.320
it's kind of done."


00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.360
Like, no, we're gonna need some time


00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.560
'cause it's really not done.


00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.240
I know it looks good, but it's not.


00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.360
- Yeah, you made it look too good, basically.


00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.200
- Yeah, exactly.


00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.240
That was a serious mistake.


00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.040
Okay, so we got a little bit more time


00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.760
to talk about a couple of things.


00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.960
I wanna talk about how people actually share this.


00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.440
You know, like we're still talking about a thing


00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.600
I pip install locally and it has a UI, but what do I do?


00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.440
I still don't want to set up a Linux machine


00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:36.640
and Nginx and domains and all that.


00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.520
So what are the options?


00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.600
But before we get to that,


00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.440
tell us a bit about the internals.


00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:47.440
Like when you guys work on Gradio and I pip install it,


00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.920
like what's running, what is this project?


00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.760
- Yeah, for sure.


00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:56.360
So the backend is a FastAPI server.


00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:59.160
So what Gradle will do, it'll spin up a server for you.


00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.840
And then that server will serve the front-end assets.


00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.760
The front-end is built in Svelte.


00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:13.240
And then basically, whenever these reactivity events happen,


00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.600
what will happen is that the front-end will just


00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.040
call the back-end API and then run your function


00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.640
and then make sure that all the necessary processing that


00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.360
needs to happen to get your data ready happens.


00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.920
But at the end of the day, it's kind of a simple model in that sense.


00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:34.320
Right. Obviously, there's like some more complications with, you know, like the streaming, for example.


00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.040
So that's a whole kind of different code path almost.


00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:44.840
But at the end of the day, it's kind of like a REST server that's talking with a JavaScript client.


00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:53.160
So it's kind of like the standard developer tools story for Python people.


00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:57.760
is it's not, some of it is Python, but you probably end up writing a lot of


00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.040
JavaScript or TypeScript.


00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.240
Yeah.


00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.040
Like most of the tool for other people.


00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:02.360
Right.


00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.640
So they don't have to.


00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.240
Yeah.


00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.640
The I'm not, I'm not a huge Svelte expert.


00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:11.200
I like, thankfully there's some of the people I work with are like really good


00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.280
at, you know, the really knowledgeable and that stuff.


00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.480
And like, yeah, like the front end code, I think it's, I think there's more


00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.920
Svelte code than Python code.


00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.200
Actually.


00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:18.600
I'm curious.


00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.040
Like what the, what the language says are.


00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.280
Let's break it down.


00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.560
65% Python, 16% Svelte, 13% TypeScript.


00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.600
- Well, so I think the reason might be that


00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.040
we have a lot of like demos and stuff that-


00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:33.880
- Yeah.


00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.080
- Yeah, I think there might be some stuff-


00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.640
- Yeah, the demos are in there.


00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.480
- Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of demos.


00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:39.780
- So what would feature GitHub needs


00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.960
as you navigate the source tree, right?


00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.520
When I click on like client or demo or Gradio,


00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.240
it would be awesome if those stats would also be repeated,


00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.680
but just for that section of code, wouldn't that be great?


00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.520
- Yeah.


00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.480
- Like how much of the demos are Python?


00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.640
I don't know.


00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.480
Maybe I just want to know that, but that'd be cool.


00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.520
Anyway, yeah, so I suspect that is,


00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.760
there's probably a lot of code


00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.760
and you've got a lot of notebooks and stuff in there too.


00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.000
That probably puts a big.


00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
- Yeah, but yeah, the, yeah,


00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.080
like a lot of the code is actually,


00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.400
yeah, JavaScript's built.


00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.880
- Right, it's the, you know, take one for the team


00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.800
so the rest of us don't have to write JavaScript.


00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.880
- Exactly, yeah.


00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.040
- Yeah, cool.


00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.720
Okay, interesting, very nice.


00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.860
And it says it can be embedded in a notebook,


00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:28.700
which is interesting, or it can be presented as a webpage.


00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.140
Tell us about this part.


00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:35.140
- Right, so if you were to run this on any notebook,


00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.840
you know, like Google Colab, for example,


00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.900
I think this might be it.


00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.780
Right, so if you call like,


00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:41.820
the way that Gradle works, right,


00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.980
like once you create your Gradle interface or blocks,


00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:46.900
once you call launch,


00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.340
that's kind of how you start up the server.


00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.180
That's how you, you know,


00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.780
kick off the whole process of serving this.


00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.060
That'll create the server locally, right?


00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.860
So like no data is like leaving your machine.


00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.260
Right, and then if you click,


00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.900
if you call launch on like a Jupyter Notebook,


00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.260
Colab, SageMaker, like the UI will display


00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:03.540
like in the notebook, right?


00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:07.680
Right, and then you could, if you're doing locally as well,


00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.460
like the, you know, you can kind of go to like


00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:13.860
the local host URL and, you know, go to the server that way.


00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.420
And then like the really cool thing is that,


00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:18.060
yeah, there you go, there's a UI.


00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.060
- Nice, okay.


00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.060
- Yeah, so that's kind of what we mean


00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.060
that it's like embedded locally.


00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.060
And then if-- - So it feels good,


00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.060
like a little bit like the


00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.060
like I


00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.060
widgets.


00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.060
- It's similar to that, right? Like it'll


00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.060
display right underneath the cell, right? And then if you


00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.060
run the cell again, like you'll get


00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.060
like a new server


00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:42.060
basically, right? So you can kind of-- - Got it, okay.


00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:44.060
- You can iteratively build these things, right?


00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.060
- Is it running FastAPI


00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.480
- Yeah, it's pretty nuts.


00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.680
- Turtles all the way down.


00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.520
- Yeah.


00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.340
(laughs)


00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.220
And then, yeah, so then,


00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.060
that's kind of like what we mean,


00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:55.220
that it can be embedded in a notebook.


00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.340
And then you could also like host it anywhere, right?


00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:00.060
So you could, you know, if you have your own,


00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.460
if your machine is, you know, exposed to the internet,


00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.940
right, you have like a fixed IP address,


00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:07.180
you could just kind of give people that URL.


00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.060
You could also share it another way, right?


00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:09.980
Like, so,


00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.500
you know, you could share it to your friends,


00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:18.300
So every Gradle interface is like a launch method.


00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.080
That's what kicks off the server.


00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.260
And that takes a parameter called share.


00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:24.900
So if you hit share equals through, true,


00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:28.180
that'll create like a temporary link for 72 hours


00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.460
so you could share with someone.


00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.300
So you don't have to,


00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.900
you could host it right on your laptop if you wanted to,


00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.740
as long as your laptop is available.


00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.700
- As long as you leave it on, yeah.


00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:35.900
- Yeah, as long as you leave it on,


00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.540
it's like not sleeping and stuff,


00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.900
like people can access your demo.


00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.620
So if you go back to that Colab notebook,


00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.420
I think we might be able to like demo that.


00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:45.260
- I see.


00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.100
- So if you go to launch--


00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:49.720
- So I just say here, say share equals true and rerun it.


00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.560
- Yeah.


00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.260
- So we're good.


00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:53.780
- I scroll all the way down.


00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.380
Yeah, so you see a greater dot live, right?


00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.220
So if you click that--


00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:59.420
- Wow, that totally works.


00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.300
- Yeah, you can select that to wherever you want


00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.620
and they can just use this.


00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.460
- Okay.


00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.940
- So that, yeah, like no, like no install needed, right?


00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.820
Like if you're sharing this with your collaborator,


00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:12.200
your PM, your manager, your friend, whatever,


00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.100
you could just give them this link, right?


00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.760
So you don't have to do anything.


00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.240
So to get--


00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.540
- Yeah, I guess it's probably worth emphasizing,


00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:23.660
you should never try to host production.


00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:24.500
- Absolutely. - Up over this,


00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.340
it sounds like, 'cause it's only for a limited time


00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:29.420
and it's just a good looking URL.


00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:34.180
But so often you'll be in meetings over Zoom


00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:35.380
or something else and they'll be like,


00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.260
"Hey, what have you done?


00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.100
"Can you show me?"


00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:37.920
And then you're like, "All right,


00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.040
let me do screen sharing.


00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.360
Oh, I don't have, I'm not a host.


00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.240
Can you make me a host?


00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.280
Now can I, you're sharing, can I share?


00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.840
And then finally you get it up and it's blocky


00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.580
and they're like, oh, zoom in, it's too small.


00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.920
I'm on my phone.


00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.800
You know, this way you just take that


00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.080
and you give it to them in the meeting, right?


00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.160
And they have a full fidelity thing they can play with,


00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.180
which is awesome.


00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.060
- Yeah, they have the demo itself


00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:59.320
that's running on your machine, right?


00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.640
So they don't have to, you know, like, yeah, like no,


00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.880
you don't have to install anything, right?


00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.960
It's just, just go to your,


00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.600
point your browser at this URL and then yeah,


00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.300
It'll work for that quick demo.


00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:10.480
- Yeah, exactly. - Use case as well.


00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.840
Yeah, definitely don't use it for production.


00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.360
Yeah, if you wanted to use, you know,


00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.720
for production, I think, you know,


00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.200
like the easiest, the absolute easiest way


00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.240
is to use Hugging Face Spaces.


00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.840
So if you go to Hugging Face Spaces,


00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:22.400
it's basically like a drag and drop, right?


00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.700
Like all you have to do is just drag your Gradle script


00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.880
into like their UI and then that'll upload it.


00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.880
And then like Gradle will already be installed


00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.880
and then like the server will start


00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.640
and then like there you have your permanent hosting.


00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.880
And then it's also like, it has like a Git interface, right?


00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.680
So like your demo has like, you know, several files,


00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.240
like directory, there's like some assets,


00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.640
some images that you need that you want to like upload


00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.400
as well, like you could just like get pushed


00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.820
to your Hugging Face space.


00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:52.640
And then, you know, you can do it like that as well.


00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.480
So, yeah.


00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.800
- Okay, so you add it as an origin or something


00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.080
and then just push to it.


00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.880
- Yeah, so yeah, I could try to show it.


00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:03.400
I don't know if you can have a,


00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.280
can I share my screen?


00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.120
I want to.


00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.280
- Yeah, sure, click at the bottom.


00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.920
Share, it's easier if you share an app, yeah.


00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:18.000
- Okay, so I'm sharing this,


00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.480
but if I go to like my Huggy Face account,


00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:26.440
I can go here and then new space,


00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:30.760
and then this is talk Python demo.


00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.400
- Nice. - MIT.


00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.480
- Oh yeah, do whatever you want with this.


00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.240
- Yeah, right, so you could host Streamlight, Radio,


00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:41.880
you know, Docker, you know, anything you want, right?


00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:44.360
So for free, you know, very generous free tier,


00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:46.280
you have two CPUs. - That is a generous free tier,


00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.000
two CPUs, 16 gigs. - Yeah, and then--


00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.480
- That's good. - Yeah, and then


00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.360
the only caveat is that this will go to sleep


00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.800
after like 72 hours if no one uses it, right?


00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.640
So, but, you know, you could also like upgrade,


00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.280
you know, if you have a machine learning model,


00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.800
you need a GPU, you pay for the GPU per hour,


00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.440
And then yeah, you just have public or private


00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.100
and then you just create space.


00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.800
And then yeah, this is kind of how


00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.240
the Git interface real works, right?


00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.880
So you could just get clone this


00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.040
and then add your code and then just get push.


00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.900
Or you could just copy this.


00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:22.440
- Copy the code and just paste it to a file, yeah.


00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.280
- Add file.


00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.160
- It does feel very Git-like, right?


00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.400
Even has the similar look and feel of like


00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.320
you go to Git and you say add new file.


00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.160
Yeah.


00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.880
- So hello.


00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:36.880
- Talk Python.


00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.720
And then.


00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.960
- A perfect commit message.


00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.360
No, no comment, just blank.


00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.200
I love it.


00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:51.560
- And then we'll give it a.


00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.640
- Give it a second to provision itself.


00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.540
- Yeah, and then it should be.


00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:57.760
That shouldn't take too long.


00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:00.320
- So over here, they run in Docker containers


00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.360
or Kubernetes or something like that?


00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.720
- Yeah, it's a Docker container.


00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.960
So what this is doing, it's that it's,


00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:09.080
it has like a pre-configured Gradio Docker image, right?


00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.860
That comes with, there we go, I've already built,


00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:14.020
but it comes with Gradio and, you know,


00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:18.380
like a bunch of standard, like data science libraries.


00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:21.140
And then you, right, and then like it'll,


00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:22.980
and then it adds your code to the container


00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:23.980
and then it starts a container, right?


00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.300
But you could also just use your own Docker file


00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.880
if you wanted to.


00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:28.720
- Okay.


00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.580
- You can post whatever you want, right?


00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.300
So here, let's say--


00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:33.900
- Yeah, you gotta put your name and a present.


00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:34.740
Wow, look at that.


00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:35.560
- Michael, yeah.


00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.400
So yeah, so that's--


00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.020
- So in the time that we've been talking about this,


00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.740
you've created a space and created a new UI and hosted it.


00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.260
That's pretty ridiculous, yeah.


00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:47.980
- And then you could just share this, share that stuff.


00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:49.140
- Share the URL or whatever.


00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.460
- Yeah, you can just share the URL with them


00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:55.460
and then they have like a machine learning app


00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:58.020
that they could share it, they can use with,


00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:58.940
they could share with anyone


00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:00.980
and it'll stay up.


00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.220
Yeah, and like, it's just Git, right?


00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:04.620
So if you have Git locally, if you know how to use Git,


00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:06.820
you can very seamlessly use,


00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:07.980
push to the Hugging Face platform.


00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:09.300
There's no special--


00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.100
- Yeah, yeah, that's super cool.


00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.420
- Yeah.


00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.300
- So what if I'm not a hugger?


00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.580
What if I, for some reason, don't wanna use Hugging Face,


00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:20.380
can I host this on behind Nginx


00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:23.500
or somewhere if I like infrastructure,


00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.820
or I'd like to do my infrastructure as a service?


00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.020
- Yeah, no, absolutely.


00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:30.580
you could just, just that app.py file, right?


00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:34.940
Just call, you know, Python that app.py from your cloud


00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.760
and then just make sure that the URL is, you know,


00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.180
the port is accessible for the internet


00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.020
and you just get that to everyone.


00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:40.840
- Right, right.


00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.420
Or front that with Nginx and put it in--


00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:43.260
- Yeah, exactly.


00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.060
- Let's encrypt and then just point it over to that URL


00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:47.840
and let it go, it'd be pretty straightforward.


00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:49.340
- Right, yeah, so you could, you could post it


00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.460
wherever you want, it's just, you know,


00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:52.260
it's all open source tech under the hood, right?


00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:54.380
It's just FastAPI, belts,


00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:55.980
and then some Python libraries, right?


00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:58.120
There's no lock in anywhere.


00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.040
- Yeah, cool.


00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.620
So it's probably running uvicorn, I would guess,


00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:05.620
as the server, which is production-ish.


00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.300
I guess if you did really large scale,


00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:13.220
you might wanna do g-unicorn with the uvicorn workers,


00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:14.580
or rather than just uvicorn itself,


00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:16.320
but for the failover and whatnot.


00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:19.060
But still, that sounds like,


00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:22.820
if these words sound familiar to you,


00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:23.820
it should sound really familiar.


00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.740
If they don't, then don't worry about it, right?


00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.740
- Yeah, exactly.


00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:30.500
- That's the standard Python web infrastructure stack


00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:31.500
type of stuff.


00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:32.620
- Right.


00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:37.540
- Okay, so in that model, it's completely free, right?


00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:40.500
It's open source, I can do, I can just run it there, right?


00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:42.940
- Yeah, you just run it, run it wherever you want.


00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.140
- Okay, yeah.


00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.340
Very nice.


00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:48.180
Well, Freddy, let's wrap up our conversation,


00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:50.940
give a short on time with just where things are going.


00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:53.900
We talked about where we are, where it came from,


00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:55.140
where are we going?


00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:59.040
- Yeah, no, that's, yeah, thanks for, yeah, thanks for that.


00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:02.860
So I think, like, where we are, so I think,


00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:04.860
we're trying to get Gradio into, like,


00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.900
as many platforms as possible, right?


00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.500
So, and like, as many kind of, like,


00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.880
deployment modes as possible.


00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:14.080
So, like, one of the cool projects that we're working on


00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.760
is Gradio Wasm, right?


00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.840
So, like, running Gradio entirely in the browser.


00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:19.680
- Oh, okay.


00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.740
- So, yeah, so that's, like, it's not ready,


00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:23.840
it's not released yet, but it's something


00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.280
that we're actively working on, right?


00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:28.720
So you can, yeah, so if you wanted to like,


00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:31.800
you know, just build your machine learning demo,


00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.640
running everything directly in the browser, right?


00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.520
There's like the ML for the web space is growing a lot.


00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:37.520
It's advancing really quickly.


00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.240
Like we're getting ready,


00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.320
we're getting ready for that.


00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:45.920
- So what's that look like in terms of foundations?


00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:48.200
Is that Pyodide?


00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.320
Is that PyScript?


00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.640
Is that something else?


00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:54.600
- It's using Pyodide right now.


00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.440
- Okay.


00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:59.600
- Yeah, so I think that's kind of how--


00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.760
- Yeah, that's a pretty good choice


01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.240
because one of the selling points of Pyodide,


01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.640
not just that it has Python in the browser,


01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.280
but that it has the ability,


01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.740
it has a bunch of the machine learning libraries,


01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.960
either available or compiled over to Wasm,


01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.860
- Yeah. - The assembly.


01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.960
And so you can actually do machine learning stuff,


01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.280
not just like, hi, my name is plus name,


01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.280
you know what I mean?


01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.120
- Yeah.


01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.800
Yeah, so that's one of the cool parts


01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.760
we're working on this year.


01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.820
The other cool project that we're working on is,


01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.960
yeah, like the custom components, right?


01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.320
So like, let's say that you wanted to, you know,


01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.240
build your own custom machine learning demo,


01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.640
your own custom web app, right?


01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.880
But you need something that we don't have.


01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.360
Giving you the API to kind of build that component locally,


01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.180
and then just kind of hook it into the app


01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:48.820
without having to merge anything into Gradio upstream.


01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.460
So we're working on that actively.


01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.780
So that'll be really exciting.


01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.660
And then, yeah, really excited just 'cause


01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:58.060
it'll enable a lot of people in the Gradio community


01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.340
to kind of collaborate with each other


01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.420
and kind of build really impressive stuff


01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.380
kind of on their own, right?


01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:07.580
Like they don't need the core development team necessarily


01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.420
to build stuff for them. - Sure, kind of like


01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.420
pytest plugins rather than trying to change pytest.


01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.260
- Exactly, right? - Okay.


01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.380
So yeah, really excited about that.


01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:19.980
And then, yeah, I think the other cool stuff is that,


01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:23.140
you know, we're, one thing that we didn't talk about


01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.780
that I kind of want to talk about if we have time


01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.580
is that, you know, all these demos that we've built


01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.780
are sort of available via API, right?


01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.220
So if you click on any of these demos,


01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.020
like if you click on that first one,


01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.740
if you scroll to the bottom,


01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:40.800
and you'll see it says use via API, right?


01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.180
So this gives you like a little code snippet,


01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:48.180
So how you can call this demo from Python or JavaScript.


01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:52.100
Right, so like, what does that mean, right?


01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:54.220
Like that means that basically all these ML apps


01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.380
that are available on HuggyFace


01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.420
or just anywhere on the internet,


01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:58.260
like they now become like building blocks


01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.780
that you can use in your own workflow, right?


01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:04.060
So, and actually this demo itself,


01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.700
I'm familiar with it, it's actually really cool


01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:09.820
'cause it's calling two other Gradio demos via API, right?


01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.220
So this is an example of someone building their Gradio app


01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.180
by calling other Gradio apps, right?


01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:17.620
So, yeah, so we're kind of creating this ecosystem


01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:18.460
where-- - It's like


01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.500
Gradio microservices.


01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.340
- Exactly, right?


01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.620
So it's like all these Gradio apps or building blocks


01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:25.980
that you can then kind of connect together via API.


01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:26.900
And that's really cool, right?


01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.020
'Cause like it basically means that


01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.300
machine learning is available, you know,


01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.380
like you don't need to use the GUI


01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:36.380
to get state of the art machine learning, right?


01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.300
You could kind of like use an API


01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.940
and that means that you could put these models


01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.940
like pretty much anywhere, right?


01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:44.480
So like one of the cool things that we launched two weeks ago, I believe, or like a week and


01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:51.620
a half ago is that you can deploy any, you can deploy like a Gradio chat bot to Discord,


01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:53.180
like just one line of code, right?


01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:57.900
So like, like if you, let's say if you have a Gradio app that, you know, talks with like,


01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:03.420
you know, OpenAI, like QTT3 or LLAMA or, you know, any of these like open source LLMs,


01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:07.220
if you can build a Gradio app for it, you can like seamlessly kind of like hook it into


01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.460
your Discord server, right?


01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:12.700
And then that's all built via this API functionality.


01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:15.900
So this is something that I'm personally super excited about it.


01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.700
We want to push this further.


01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:23.340
Just because it's like, Gradle historically has been built for the UI,


01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:27.660
but it can also be used to get these machine learning models into more places.


01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:32.660
Yeah, so that's one of the things that I'm really excited about in the coming years,


01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:36.220
making this a little bit more visible.


01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:40.680
Yeah, you could integrate some really cool LLMs


01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.000
and other types of chat into your--


01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.320
Right, into your WhatsApp.


01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.720
I imagine you could probably do it with Slack as well.


01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:52.160
And if somebody asks in your company, how do I whatever,


01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.760
the thing could go, hey, I'm private GPT.


01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.720
I've already ingested all of our docs.


01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.000
You want me to take a shot at answering that?


01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.240
Sure, why not?


01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:01.920
Exactly.


01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.040
Yeah, that's kind of--


01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.040
That's one of the pet projects I want to do


01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.480
is just do that for the Gradio Discord.


01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.720
So there's a Gradio Discord where you could


01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.680
chat with the Gradio community.


01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.000
And people ask questions in it.


01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.080
But it'd be really cool if we had a Gradio chat bot


01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.760
that knew a lot about Gradio that then you could just ask,


01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.000
right, @bot or /GradioChat,


01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.600
how do I, whatever, how do I display a plot, right?


01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.800
And then it'll tell you,


01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.800
just return a matplotlib from your--


01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.120
- Right, and people could think,


01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.900
well, why don't I just use ChatGPT or something?


01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:38.780
But you teach it deeply.


01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.220
You give it all the docs.


01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:44.340
And you say, study this, and then I want to ask you about it.


01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:47.820
And a lot of times, the docs and other things


01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:51.900
go beyond the token level that the standard models can take.


01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:55.700
I've tried to get GPT to tell me about transcripts on Talk Python,


01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.220
and it can't even adjust one transcript


01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.140
before it runs out of space.


01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.020
I can't quite load all that.


01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.540
I want to ask you about all of them.


01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:04.460
You can't even do one.


01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.020
- Yeah, this is not working for me.


01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.740
- Exactly, right, so yeah, so you could fine tune


01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.340
like an open source LLM and then host it


01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.180
wherever you want, right?


01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:11.540
- Yes, exactly.


01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.900
- More control.


01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.240
- Yeah, that's cool.


01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.260
So you could teach all about Gradio.


01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.700
Real quick question, Mr. Magnetic in the audience asks,


01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:21.140
what about a Hugging Face desktop app


01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.660
instead of the browser app?


01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.420
- Yeah, so that's something that,


01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.460
there's an open issue for that.


01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:29.220
It's something that we've kind of been kicking around as well


01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:31.980
it's just like, how do we get, you know,


01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:34.060
like a Gradio desktop app as well?


01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.740
So yes, stay tuned.


01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:38.300
I think, let me try to find that issue


01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.500
and then comment in the YouTube.


01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.720
But yeah, would love your thoughts on that,


01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.080
if anyone has thoughts on that.


01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.900
But yeah, it's something we're thinking about.


01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.140
It's not, I don't think it'll happen


01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.620
maybe in the next like month or two,


01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.060
but maybe before the end of the year


01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:50.900
or next year it could happen.


01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:51.740
- Excellent.


01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:56.260
All right, well, I think that pretty well covers it.


01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.540
It's a super exciting project.


01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:58.780
So good luck with it.


01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:00.500
I mean, already you've had a lot of luck with it,


01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.640
so you don't need my wishes.


01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.120
but further good luck on that.


01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.160
And yeah, before we get out of here,


01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.360
let me ask you a final question here.


01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.840
If you're, you know, I always ask,


01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.840
like to ask the guests are like some cool


01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.480
PyPI project they've run across.


01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.720
That's been really awesome.


01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.360
Maybe not super popular, but is,


01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.440
it's really kind of made a difference or you've like, wow,


01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.840
how did I not know about this?


01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.800
Any come to mind for you?


01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.960
- Python project?


01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.800
- Yeah, yeah.


01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.000
Like something I can pip install.


01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:28.840
- I think-


01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.040
- Like FastAPI, but not FastAPI.


01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:30.880
- Yeah, yeah.


01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.640
I think when I was just starting out,


01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.080
I think I was a really big noob


01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:41.200
and I always ran into environment issues.


01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.920
And then a friend of mine showed me a PipDep tree


01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:47.000
and it shows you exactly why things get installed.


01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.360
And yeah, I think it's really magical, honestly.


01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:54.820
Yeah, I think it's really helpful just to figure out,


01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:59.200
especially when someone files an issue


01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.400
and we don't know what's wrong with them.


01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.680
Sometimes I'll just like,


01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.280
where did this thing even come from?


01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.680
And then just use like TipTapTree.


01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.520
I think that's really cool.


01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.320
It's really simple.


01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.040
But yeah, I think it definitely has saved me


01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.600
a couple hours of time.


01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.920
So yeah.


01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.760
- That's cool.


01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.580
I've used it for my own stuff.


01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.240
I hadn't thought about using it for tech support,


01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.280
but yeah, of course.


01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.240
Because often people run into problems


01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.680
'cause their environments are screwed up


01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.120
and they say they have a thing or they don't,


01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.500
or they say they have a version of a thing,


01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:26.340
but they don't.


01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.320
And with this, you can just say run this one command


01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.960
and it'll give you like a really cool.


01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.240
They have all these things installed


01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:37.160
and this is installed because it's required.


01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.040
Yeah, exactly.


01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.520
It's really nice.


01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.340
- Yeah.


01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:42.360
- Cool, excellent recommendation.


01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.440
All right, final call to action.


01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.560
People wanna get started with Gradio.


01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.040
What'd you tell them?


01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:51.160
- Yeah, install Gradio and then go to gradioapp.com


01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.240
and then see the demos there.


01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:56.880
In our website, there's a link to our Discord server.


01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.300
So yeah, join the Discord and say hi.


01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.040
And then yeah, there's lots of people there


01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.240
who are willing to help.


01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.840
And then yeah, never hesitate to file an issue.


01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.000
But yeah, I think what's really cool about this


01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.880
is like seeing the demos that people build


01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.160
and like people build stuff that I, you know,


01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.520
frankly like push the limits


01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.360
of what I thought people could build with Gradio.


01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.000
And it's really cool seeing that.


01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.320
So yeah, like don't be afraid to,


01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.400
or don't hesitate to build really cool stuff with Gradio.


01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.600
I think we're really good about amplifying that.


01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.080
So if you have something really cool,


01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.200
just tag the Grady Twitter account


01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.440
or reach out to us on Discord or something.


01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.640
We'll amplify it for you.


01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.720
- Cool.


01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.240
Well, excellent project and thank you for being on the show.


01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.080
- Thank you for having me, Michael.


01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.280
I had a lot of fun.


01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.280
- Yeah, same.
