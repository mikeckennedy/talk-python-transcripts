00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Richard, welcome. We've voted.


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Great to be here. I had some adventures this morning. I'm sorry to delay so long.


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yeah, you had to go to space, which is very, very accurate.


00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Yeah. You know, compared to all the things that you're into and the things we talked about before. So yeah, people out in the live stream. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being patient and sticking around.


00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.780
Yeah, Richard had a little bit of internet trouble.


00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.360
He's in this glorious, but somewhat remote location.


00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.760
- So we do have cable modems up here,


00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.360
but the cable modem died.


00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.720
We're in Pacific Northwest,


00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.680
and it looks like the stream heat may have damaged the wire.


00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.160
So now they're, they want to replace the wire.


00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.800
But I had, I got on the beta of Starlink a while back.


00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.640
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.280
- Fun to play with,


00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.600
but suddenly we're depending on Starlink


00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600
because the cable modem stopped working.


00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.760
Although, and it's been pretty good,


00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.000
but if you're watching this,


00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.800
you can see the video and certainly this audio,


00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.440
it's coming to you from space.


00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.480
- Yeah, it may or may not glitch just a little bit,


00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.080
but the recording-- - There are some dropouts.


00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.480
- Yeah, yeah, so, and thanks for your patience with that.


00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.680
All right, Richard, you ready to kick this off?


00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.520
- Do it.


00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.200
- Richard, welcome back to Talk Python To Me.


00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.040
- Yeah, it's been a year, quite a year, as I recall.


00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.720
- We're living in like dog years or something like that.


00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.120
Every year is like seven years.


00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.440
I don't know if we spoke about it,


00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.920
but I have definitely joked that historians,


00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.080
when they come back and study this timeframe,


00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.920
they won't be able to say what decade


00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.920
or what era they studied.


00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.260
It'll be like, well, what part of 2020 did you study?


00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.600
What part of 2021 did you study?


00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.320
Did you study the summer or was it the spring?


00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.120
'Cause that's a different specialty.


00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.000
- How much it's changed.


00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.840
And that we're still living


00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.920
with a certain level of uncertainty.


00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.880
that at the time that we're recording this,


00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880
the Delta variant's having an impact


00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.720
and I think everyone's sort of leaning back again,


00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.960
going, "How bad is this gonna get?"


00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.360
So, yeah, I don't know.


00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.680
A month from now, things would be very different.


00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.040
Either way.


00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.320
- Yeah, it could go either way.


00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.380
That's absolutely right.


00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.840
Yeah, so I'm cautiously optimistic,


00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.280
trying to live life, be safe,


00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.360
but not be huddled in a corner for too badly.


00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.360
- And for your own sanity.


00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.400
I mean, one nice thing about being up on the coast


00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.520
is like the view is impeccable.


00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.880
The we're right on the ocean.


00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.920
You'll probably even hear a bit in the recording,


00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.080
like to be able to be out here and breathe the air


00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.280
and just try and connect with folks.


00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.320
Even if it's, it has to be remote, that's all.


00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.000
- Yeah, yeah.


00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.240
Well, for the audio podcast listeners,


00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.600
tell us how you are speaking to us.


00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.160
- How am I speaking to you?


00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.000
- Yeah, yeah.


00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.240
on the internet?


00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.040
I got on the beta for Starlink right at the very beginning and because we're in this relatively


00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.960
new era, we opted in very early on.


00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.520
There is cable modem service up here but it's broken at the moment and so there's repairs


00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.400
trying to be done this morning which is one of the reasons we delayed recording.


00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.320
But they have not been successful so far.


00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.800
counting on Elon's magic as now the largest satellite operator in the world.


00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.800
And soon he'll be more satellites than everybody else combined at the rate he's going.


00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.120
And it's been pretty good. There are dropouts, it's never flawless. And this is what we're asking


00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.640
it to do, this real-time thing is of course the hardest thing to do. Right, right. We're going


00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.760
real-time to space, which is pretty amazing, but it's kind of cool. I haven't had a chance to speak


00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.880
with anyone who's had real experience with Starlink.


00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.080
So it's neat to have it.


00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.280
- You're part of the experiment now, friend.


00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.480
Here we are.


00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.320
- Exactly.


00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.440
We were planning on using high-speed wired internet,


00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.280
but it broke.


00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.640
And so it's a really cool fallback to have.


00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.000
And I think it's actually gonna be really empowering


00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.520
for people in places where that's not an option.


00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.120
- Yeah, and certainly I've talked to a bunch of friends


00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.760
who are all very interested in it.


00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.480
And because I'm right on the ocean,


00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.880
I have a view of the sky.


00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.600
And that's the real problem with Starlink,


00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.480
is you need an absolutely clear view of the sky.


00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.160
And often when you're in remote locations,


00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.800
you're surrounded by trees,


00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.200
and trees and Starlink are not friends.


00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.320
- And satellites definitely don't mix.


00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.000
- Yeah, it just doesn't work.


00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.400
- Well, I'm really glad that we're able to make this happen.


00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.840
And I say that with fingers crossed


00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.960
for another 45 minutes or whatever it's going to be.


00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.880
- By the time we, yeah.


00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.520
Let's hope the satellites are well aligned


00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.960
for this next period and we'll have a good call.


00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.280
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.420
So this episode is gonna be like some of the previous ones


00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.840
that you've been on before


00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.760
and that it's going to be one of these geek out episodes.


00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.960
And the geek out episodes I learned about,


00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.140
which mostly, I guess, premiered on .NET Rocks.


00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.280
Is that right? - Right.


00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.920
Yeah, it was totally my friend Carl's idea.


00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.140
I did not wanna do these.


00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.460
I thought it was a bad idea and I was wrong.


00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.460
So the first Geek Out was back in 2011


00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.760
and it was about the shuttle ending


00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.660
and just my thoughts on what went right


00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.420
and what went wrong with the space shuttle.


00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.500
And it continued from there, it became a pleasure for me.


00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.540
I'm a researcher by nature


00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.460
and I've always been organizing my (indistinct)


00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.940
just 'cause I like to read and research.


00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.600
And the shows basically drove me to finish.


00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.120
now make an hour long conversation about that technology.


00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.000
- Isn't that interesting about being able


00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.160
to present something?


00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.980
- Yeah.


00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.760
- That you have to, you close those loops


00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.800
that you're like, oh, that's interesting,


00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.600
but I am not gonna dig into that corner


00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.520
or that corner of this thing.


00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.520
And then when you've got to stand up and present it,


00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.760
you know, I feel like that's a great way to learn stuff


00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.040
in general as people in technology,


00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.640
not just for the geek out thing.


00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.000
- One of the series that I'm very proud of


00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.140
that absolutely the process of making this show


00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.180
transformed it was the Fusion series because I originally thought I'd do a show on Fusion,


00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.580
but as I started really organizing all the materials, I realized there was three different


00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:25.340
shows there. There was a show about national fusion like the ITER and JET and the National


00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.460
Ignition Laboratories, all these big government projects. And then there was the tech billionaire


00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.620
pet fusion projects because you're not a cool tech billionaire if you don't have one. And


00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.220
So there's a moment where I realized,


00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.980
geez, every one of them has one, and they're all wacky.


00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.300
And then I ran across a set of papers out


00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.260
at Mitsubishi Labs about fusion reactions.


00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
And that actually walked us into a real conversation


00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
about cold fusion, which surprised me.


00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.020
Because it's like pseudoscience for a long time.


00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.540
But the Mitsubishi Labs experiments in the late 2000


00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.300
were very real and repeatable.


00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.980
They, you know, Mitsubishi was smart enough


00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.200
that when they realized they had something consistent,


00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.460
they handed it over to Toyota, their arch rival,


00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.220
and said, "Here, you reproduce this."


00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.420
'Cause if anybody was gonna reproduce this,


00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.580
it was their arch rival.


00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.940
And they repeated the experiment successfully.


00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.540
And if you listen to that show, I'll give away the ending.


00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.420
Yes, you can do lower energy nuclear reactions.


00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.040
They are a kind of fusion.


00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.540
It's a part of science that's not well understood.


00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.700
more energy to do it than it produces.


00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.500
Just the sort of thing you don't want from a power plant.


00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.300
- Exactly, well you can make it happen,


00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.660
but it doesn't produce net energy.


00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.620
- No, it's the fun part of that show


00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.580
is I'm walking Carl through the process,


00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.580
and Carl's always a great everyman


00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.820
for these kinds of things,


00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.380
and I actually taught muon catalyzed fusion,


00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.960
which is a different kind of low energy fusion,


00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.380
and very repeatable, workable, and so forth.


00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.620
It's just that it takes more energy to make muons


00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.300
than the fusion, which it turns out


00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.780
is every kind of fusion except stellar fusion,


00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.660
that's how it's always worked.


00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.260
It takes more energy to fuse than it emits.


00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.900
- Yeah, well, if you got that much gravity,


00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.180
it definitely is an unfair advantage.


00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.260
So yeah, so this is going to be another one


00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.980
of these Geek Out episodes, and we're mostly


00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.660
going to just focus on the energy side.


00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.740
So it's sort of relevant that you're talking about fusion here.


00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.020
The other thing I guess that's worth just giving a quick shout out to


00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.460
is you're organizing the Dev Intersection Conference, right?


00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.020
Yeah, so we did a show back in June as a full hybrid show.


00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.700
So some attendees in person, some attendees remote,


00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.260
and some speakers in person, some speakers.


00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.100
We know how to do that.


00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.260
We're hoping to do a more in-person show in Vegas,


00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.380
but we're prepared to do hybrid again if necessary,


00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.780
because we pulled it off.


00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.020
But this is a developer show and we have a lot of Microsoft,


00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.620
so there's lots of .NET content,


00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.220
but also web content across the board,


00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.180
plenty of Azure, artificial intelligence technologies, and databases.


00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.780
So it's a very big, broad show and a ton of fun,


00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.380
and the MGM brand is a great location for it.


00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.220
Yeah, that's really cool.


00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.820
I feel like, you know, last time we spoke,


00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.340
this was the pre-Delta, pre-large-scale vaccine,


00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.020
and like, "Oh, look, we're sort of crossing over the hump,


00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.100
And this is going to be like, you'll be able to put this back on,


00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.100
no problem. And then...


00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.980
And again, ask me in a month, and maybe it'll be fine.


00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.100
But at the moment, we're all holding our breath,


00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.900
it's like, we know what to do if we have to.


00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.900
I hope we don't have to.


00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.900
Absolutely.


00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.900
Alright, so let's dive into our main topic.


00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.900
- Okay. - We are on a bit of a time crunch


00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.900
since we're going to space.


00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.420
- On this one, I wanted to talk to you about energy.


00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.340
And I think there's a lot of things happening


00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.340
around energy that's both optimistic and amazing,


00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.700
as well as, you know, there's setbacks and other things.


00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.700
So, you know, let's talk about sort of the story of energy,


00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.940
specifically, mostly renewable energy these days.


00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.900
Like, how are we doing?


00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.980
- We're doing pretty well.


00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.320
I mean, obviously the pandemic changed things.


00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.180
Power consumption overall, especially electricity,


00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:37.180
especially in the West during the pandemic,


00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.340
closing of malls and commercial spaces and so forth,


00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.060
because those spaces tend to be very efficient


00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.380
in the sense that you do shut them down,


00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.740
they reduced a lot of power consumption.


00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.060
Now everybody went home and consumed more power at home,


00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.580
But if you think about the normal work cycle


00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.000
where people are at home, then they go to work,


00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.380
and then they come back again,


00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.640
the home is typically not as diligently shut down


00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.100
as office spaces.


00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.540
So homes have a sort of always on


00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.460
certain amount of power consumption going on.


00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.340
- Yeah, I suspect a bunch of people,


00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.660
yeah, I bet a bunch of people


00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.060
just leave their AC set to whatever.


00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:16.900
- Exactly.


00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.740
- I have one of these nests.


00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.300
- In Bilston, as I've been studying my house,


00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.420
heated floors, those electrically heated floors


00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.460
consume a lot more power than you realize.


00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.020
And if you learn how long it takes to get to the temperature


00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.100
and so forth, so that you can shut them down


00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.340
and heat them up when you need them,


00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.340
that's a lot of power.


00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.900
That's a kilowatt per floor per day, easy.


00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.740
- Oh, how interesting.


00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.180
Yeah, that is a lot of energy.


00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.620
Yeah, and air conditioners too,


00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.620
and I suspect a lot of people don't shut them down.


00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.460
So I saw an article recently that talked about


00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:57.860
Oh, we're actually being set back by people working from home because we all now have


00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.300
our computers on and our lights on and our AC or our heater, or depending on the time


00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:08.180
of the year at everybody's house instead of one giant office.


00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:14.340
But what I don't believe that took into account was the person who lives 45 minutes away from


00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:19.980
the office and commutes with an old suburban SUV that is burning extra gas.


00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.540
I think it just looked at the energy of the office and the energy of the homes and said,


00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.580
"Oh, there's more at the homes."


00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:25.860
Right?


00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.140
But...


00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.020
It limited the community.


00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.860
Well, but I don't think that's true either.


00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:34.060
In some respects, you have the same computer, if not a less efficient computer at the office.


00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.700
And so those things were turned off.


00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:45.340
I think the move to the cloud actually ends up being energy efficient because business owned servers tend to be less...


00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.120
are actually gaining efficiency in terms of power consumption


00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.880
by shifting those workloads into the cloud,


00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.580
those machines run at a much higher constant utilization rate.


00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.880
So there's fewer CPUs serving far more workloads that way.


00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.780
Right, how many VPCs, virtual servers run on top of


00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.400
one piece of hardware?


00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.760
Exactly, I mean, a lot.


00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.220
And of course, they're paid for that,


00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.380
their margin is in that optimization,


00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.340
where typically your owned servers


00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.580
just don't have that same level of utilization.


00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.780
But I think that the biggest thing that created


00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.460
in the West the huge power drops was that


00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.140
folks shut down those buildings.


00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.420
They turned as much off as they could,


00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.860
far more reliable than anything else.


00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.620
The drop in oil, recognizing that oil consumption


00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.500
is a form of gasoline and kerosene,


00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.500
50% of all oil is going into road transport and air.


00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:45.020
And so that drop was tremendous


00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.500
during the peak of the pandemic.


00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.740
In April of 2020, the oil industry calls that black April


00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.620
because in the West it was like 30% reduction.


00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.580
On a typical day in 20,


00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.320
the world consumed about 80 million barrels of oil.


00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.980
In April of 2020, it was like 45 million.


00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.660
- Yeah, that's amazing.


00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.620
- This is the thing is, that oil moves all the time.


00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.340
And so if you recall, there was a crisis


00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.760
where oil actually went to niggas


00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.080
'cause nobody had anywhere to store it.


00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.920
- I remember that.


00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.480
And there was all these people investing


00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.160
in sort of indirectly in oil.


00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.680
And what I think there were some of them,


00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.420
they didn't realize that they were on the hook


00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.600
to store that oil.


00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.480
- Exactly.


00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.320
- And then they got seriously-


00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.820
- Oil tankers arriving at refineries


00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.940
with nowhere to offload 'cause the tanks were all full.


00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.860
And now the ship was effectively a storage machine.


00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.380
Like that's how bad it got for a month.


00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.920
And it hasn't fully recovered.


00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.760
Like oil consumption is still down.


00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.440
They don't expect road transport consumption.


00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.220
And I'm referencing the IEA report.


00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.520
This is the International Energy Association.


00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.000
It's very challenging to get good energy data,


00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.320
quality energy data.


00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.660
And this is a group, they're operated out of Paris,


00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.120
but they're worldwide.


00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.820
And they are very agnostic.


00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.000
They're not owned by any energy companies.


00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.720
You know, typically when you go looking for data like this,


00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.200
you will find energy companies telling you


00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.940
about how their energy is great.


00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.480
Reasonable report you can get


00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.800
in terms of levelizing all of those numbers.


00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.920
- You've heard the clean natural gas.


00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.880
- Yeah, well, cleaner than coal.


00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.920
- It's a relative statement.


00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.760
- Give them that.


00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.420
It's about half the emission level of coal


00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.200
with significant emissions and it's cheap.


00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.760
And it's why natural gas has done so well.


00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.080
So the IEA, they break down a lot of these pandemic details.


00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.360
And one of the points they made is like,


00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.700
road transport consumption will probably reach 2019 levels


00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.620
by 2021, but air transport won't.


00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.100
The air transport's gonna take longer to come back.


00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.180
People aren't flying.


00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.460
- Yeah. - And it's had a huge impact.


00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.780
Yes, we move a lot of stuff by cargo,


00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.140
but we move far more people by air.


00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.020
And so airplanes that are still parked


00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.500
and the decrease in consumption all around is not small.


00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.860
And so in that sense, our emissions have dropped


00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.760
a non-trivial amount in the process.


00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:21.800
And the good news is when that power consumption drop happened, the power plants that got turned


00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.660
off were the dirtiest ones.


00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:30.320
So coal consumption went down dramatically in 2020 because power consumption went down.


00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.320
That's really good.


00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:37.440
I mean, that was the plants that they turned off, except in China.


00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:43.400
China actually added coal consumption because China increased their power consumption throughout


00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.400
the pandemic.


00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.160
They also, I mean, to give fair credit to China, there may have been 50% of the increase


00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.600
in coal consumption in 2020.


00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.000
There were also 50% of the increase in renewables over 2020.


00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.520
So China is growing very rapidly.


00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.760
They're building out a lot of infrastructure and they did not stop through the pandemic.


00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.120
- They did a better job of containing the pandemic as well.


00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.400
- I don't know if that's true.


00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.040
What they certainly did was did a good job


00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.280
of containing any data about their pandemic response.


00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.780
- Yeah, okay, fair.


00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.640
They also have the freedom, that's not the right word.


00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.640
They have the flexibility to impose rules differently


00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.000
than suggestions that we have


00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.760
like in North America and Europe.


00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.360
- Well, and one of the big cases is like


00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.800
the whole world has benefited from the fact


00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.840
that the Chinese government chose to simply build


00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.920
gigantic solar power plants to manufacture solar


00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.800
at a massive scale and drove the price down of solar.


00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.380
It probably wasn't the most economically efficient way


00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.760
to go about it, but it's the advantage of having,


00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.680
you know, the single party rule system that says,


00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.880
thou shalt build big solar factories, and they did.


00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.720
- Yeah.


00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.760
- And, yeah, again, set the price of solar to the floor,


00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.760
to the point where we now in the West use solar differently.


00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.560
You know, once upon a time, solar panels were so precious,


00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.520
you put them on articulated arms


00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.740
to aim them perfectly at the sun throughout the day


00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.200
to maximize utilization.


00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.200
These days, and they're expensive.


00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.760
And so when Germany did this huge push towards solar,


00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.560
as they started to try and wind down their nuclear power,


00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.260
They were putting all of these solar panels in,


00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.500
all aimed south, because they're in the north,


00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.400
and they get the most light if they're physically aimed south,


00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.180
until they were generating so much power


00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.260
at the middle of the day when they didn't need it,


00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.740
that it was actually a problem for their grid.


00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.060
And they don't do that anymore.


00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.740
They now point their panels east and west,


00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.420
which seems foolish, because it means you get less utilization


00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.100
per panel.


00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.020
But what you're actually doing is smoothing out


00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.780
your power generation.


00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.260
You don't need as much power.


00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.980
What you need is more power in the morning


00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.820
and more power in the evening.


00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.580
And moving those panels, using each panel less efficiently,


00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.480
actually makes a more efficient grid.


00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.220
- How interesting.


00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.960
So I think the area I really wanna focus on


00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.460
with our conversation is that storage side,


00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.260
because I think that's the magic of unlocking things.


00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.100
- Sure.


00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.940
- Before we do, have you seen Project Sunroof?


00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.580
- I have, it doesn't work in Canada, unfortunately.


00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.700
- That's unfortunate.


00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.060
The sun is totally different there or no?


00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.380
Well, it has a U in its name, so what are you gonna do?


00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.020
- Yeah, yeah.


00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.820
So this thing lets you go to your address


00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.260
or anyone's address and click on it and say,


00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:40.340
it gives you a heat map of the roof of your house


00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.820
for the amount of energy it's going to receive.


00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.460
And unfortunately here, I'm also in the Pacific Northwest.


00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.780
And one of the things that I think is glorious about here


00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.780
is right in my yard, I have 150 year old trees


00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.980
that are super high, right?


00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.980
which are amazing, unless you want solar radiation.


00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.640
- Unless you want sunlight to hit places, yeah.


00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.420
- Exactly, there's like a little sliver.


00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.020
- Or Starlink for that matter.


00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.500
- Yeah, both are out for me.


00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.420
Like I actually had some solar people come out


00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.440
and estimate, does it make any sense to, I mean,


00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.020
like put the money aside, does it even make sense


00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.700
just from a climate perspective?


00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.700
And they're like, you know what?


00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.660
It's gonna take five years to pay off the carbon


00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.620
of manufacturing, just the panels.


00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.640
Like, ah, all right, yeah, this is like too inefficient


00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.420
to justify, unfortunately, but--


00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.180
- Yeah, your yields are just too low.


00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.220
And it's like, if you really wanted


00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.700
to reduce your carbon footprint,


00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.860
spending that money on the best,


00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.900
the most efficient appliances you could have.


00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.820
- Right, or redoing your installation or something like that.


00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.820
- Or even using things like the Tesla power consumption types.


00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:52.620
Those things represent,


00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.060
You know, the problem with most grid power


00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.340
is that it pretty much generates


00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.580
the same amount of power all the time.


00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.820
Grid is not that flexible.


00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.460
It takes a while to spin up those big power plants.


00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:05.660
And so, for peak, and if most people,


00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.740
you know, the concept of Powerwall was,


00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.660
hey, if I can take you off the grid during peak,


00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.140
if I can store power at the cheap times,


00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.420
and then use that power at the peak times,


00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.180
we can turn off a peak power plant.


00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.540
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.780
And it seems completely reasonable.


00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.360
You know, there's been a lot of success, I think,


00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.800
with the grid scale utility level power pack


00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.560
that Tesla does.


00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.400
And I think if you had--


00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.520
- Yeah, a lot of success.


00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.560
There's been a few.


00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.520
There's been Australia being the famous one.


00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.040
- Yeah, that's the one I was thinking of, for sure.


00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:38.880
- Yeah.


00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.360
They just had a big fire at one of them.


00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.760
In terms of, you know, lithium-ion burns prolifically.


00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.800
- Yeah, I was gonna call that out.


00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.840
Where was that one?


00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.520
That was, yeah, that one was definitely,


00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.160
I guess I can't pull it up.


00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.640
But yeah, I would imagine. - The biggest advantage


00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.040
of battery over all storage methods period is recovery.


00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.540
That it comes about 90% efficient.


00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.880
So put 100, get 90 kilowatts out


00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.960
in exchange for expensive.


00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.520
- Yeah. - Right, that's the issue.


00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.480
Is that they're expensive installations,


00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.280
they do have fire risks.


00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.600
constrained, although we're starting to see some other


00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.920
battery technologies come down the pipe. The famous, the big


00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:31.040
news stories at the moment are around iron based batteries. So


00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.640
liquid, it's not the iron is not liquid, but it's a liquid


00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.440
electrolyte, iron battery, essentially rust batteries. So


00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.560
you are when you oxidize the iron, you can move, you can


00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.320
store electricity, and then you deoxidize to release the


00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.240
electricity.


00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.200
Oh, interesting. It's almost like electrolysis, but applied


00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.760
to iron? Yeah, and it's the same. And fundamentally, that's what all batteries are, right? It's


00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:59.160
doing a chemical reaction that creates new compounds. You're not going to find iron batteries


00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:05.160
in your phone anytime soon. They are big, they are heavy, but they are very grid scale.


00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.480
The most advanced batteries that I've seen that seem to have the best backing right now


00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.600
are a company called Form Energy. So they've raised about $125 million, which seems like


00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:22.920
a lot and it is in this space but all power is hundreds of millions of dollars


00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.440
so they haven't got a deal yet but they've been had some breakthroughs in


00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.600
their battery their typical battery unit is about size of a dishwasher so again


00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.520
that's the wouldn't be good for for a phone it's also because it has a liquid


00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.280
in its orientation really matter so these are meant to be held in place


00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.080
mounted on the ground.


00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.440
They run pretty hot, so they're not the sort of thing


00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.320
you want to be around, but they're cheap.


00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.540
Like, typically with lithium ion batteries today,


00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.320
we're coming in around 100,


00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.640
it may be as low as $80 a kilowatt.


00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.760
And believe me, like, when $100 a kilowatt


00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.840
was (audio cuts out) class batteries,


00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.560
that was considered the point where


00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.900
now we are price competitive with internal combustion cars.


00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.420
And that breakthrough was in the past couple of years.


00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:16.540
These iron batteries are coming in at $20 a kilowatt.


00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.380
- Wow.


00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.200
- So--


00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.260
- Are they more stable than the lithium ones as well?


00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.280
- They're, yeah, they're far less fire risk.


00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.660
And slow, steady discharging.


00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.100
So one of the claims to fame for the Form Energy battery


00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.620
is full 100 hours.


00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.220
So the idea that, again, if you think about


00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.880
What does a grid want?


00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.200
It's that ability to have stable power all of the time.


00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.640
And so being able to count on a long duration battery


00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.520
makes a lot of sense.


00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.280
So this is not the kind of battery you'd want in your home.


00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.520
Like we have this home-based,


00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.800
hey, we're going to spend less on the grid.


00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.840
We're going to put some solar panels in,


00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.640
we're going to put some power walls in,


00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.880
and we'll use the grid as backup


00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.600
and take less pressure off of that.


00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.380
But grid scale power,


00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.480
you're starting to see different kinds of storage system.


00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.060
And this is the first battery technology


00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.060
I've seen that's really based on grid style storage


00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.620
and has that really high efficiency rating.


00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.920
But it's not the only way to store power.


00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.540
- Yeah, before we move off of energy.


00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.000
Yeah, yeah, before we move off of just the battery side,


00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.580
I do wanna ask you, if you use your crystal ball


00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.240
and look into the future,


00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.140
do you see a world where we've got


00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.940
renewable energy locally generated,


00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.180
like on roofs in California


00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.500
and maybe a power wall on a house?


00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.300
Like I could see California mandating


00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.140
every house comes with some sort of local battery.


00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.940
- Yeah, and they have mandated solar.


00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.800
You don't have to apply for a permit


00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.300
to not put solar on your house.


00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.920
- Which, perfect.


00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.500
- I mean, California has often done these kinds of things.


00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.060
The battery technology is a little trickier.


00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.060
They are expensive, they are relatively fragile,


00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.700
but yeah, it's possible,


00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.500
but it's easier solved with grid in some respects.


00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.220
- Yeah, I was gonna say, do you see that future


00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.380
or do you see a future where we've got,


00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:08.380
you know, massive grid scale type of generation and storage.


00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.460
- I think it's going to be lots of both


00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.360
because there's good reasons for both.


00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.660
Now, and one of the challenges here


00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.100
when you start thinking about this micro grid behavior


00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.780
of having, it is the grid needs to get much smarter.


00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.500
We need internet technology applied


00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.740
to electrical generation and utilization.


00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.860
It's because it's a peer to peer kind of problem.


00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.460
And I mean, we're in computing, so we get that.


00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.180
But if you go talk to people who've worked


00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.860
Peer-to-peer is bizarre to them, right?


00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.600
They are very much a fewest number of power plants


00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.980
necessary to supply the load


00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.860
and a single set of wires to feed it out.


00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.660
Redundancy is an expensive, often unnecessary thing.


00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.620
And so, but that is clearly changing


00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.480
is we are creating more automation.


00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.600
So I think people will have a choice


00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.660
on how they want to consume in that respect,


00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.500
but we're starting to perfect grid storage


00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:04.500
and mostly because our renewals deliver a levelized load.


00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.880
They deliver when they deliver


00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.220
and we need to levelize with other strategies


00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.700
and that's where storage comes into play.


00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.260
- Yeah, all right.


00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.700
Two other things really quick, maybe one altogether.


00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.500
So we had a lot of resistance in the US


00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.500
to putting up windmills, wind farms off the East Coast


00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.240
because the people with their yachts,


00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.540
when they went a little farther out,


00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:32.020
they would see the windmills and they really hated it.


00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.500
And then out in the desert in Nevada,


00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.820
though what would have been a tremendously large solar,


00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.820
grid scale solar is canceled because the electric,


00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.940
the article headline is the US largest solar farm


00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.660
is canceled because Nevada locals don't wanna look at it


00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.780
while they're out on their all train vehicles,


00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.300
which I love riding all train vehicles.


00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.540
I'm not against that, but you know.


00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.980
- Well, in Nevada, also, the problem of--


00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.500
Yeah, I mean, people, there is always an NB effect.


00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.300
What's interesting about a place like Nevada and New Mexico


00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.740
is that they're doing heliosolar.


00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.180
So rather than using photovoltaic,


00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.020
they're using reflectors to heat molten salt.


00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:16.040
And what's interesting about that at that scale


00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.380
is the salt, that it still generates power


00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.280
through the night.


00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.340
You know, I mean, there's a bunch of ways


00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.460
to use molten salt.


00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.780
It's used in nuclear reactors,


00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.180
it's used in power storage systems,


00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.000
it's used in helium systems.


00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.600
The thing that's powerful about salts,


00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.220
whatever they may be, sodium-based salts,


00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.660
fluorine-based salts, it doesn't really matter,


00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.380
is that their operating liquid temperature,


00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.740
the temperature that they turn from a solid into a liquid


00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.100
is around 400 degrees Celsius,


00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.640
it varies from material to material,


00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.340
but their boiling point when they'll turn into a gas


00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.740
is past 400 degrees.


00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:53.380
So you have this huge operating range of liquid, right?


00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.020
as opposed to water, which only has 100 degree range.


00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.660
And I'm using Celsius 'cause I'm a civilized human


00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.660
for the liquid range.


00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.820
And that's not, the advantage being,


00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.020
I can do flash steam turbines


00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.620
against 500 degree Celsius salts


00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.820
just as easily as I can do against 800 degree salts


00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.640
and so forth.


00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.020
And so they carry heat long enough


00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.340
that you can bridge nighttime.


00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.940
- Right, so that's even a form of storage in a sense.


00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.860
- It is, and it has been, there is a mechanism,


00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.240
Like if we have more solar than we know what to do with,


00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.600
why don't we switch it to heaters to heat this salt up?


00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.360
'Cause after it gets past a certain temperature threshold,


00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.760
it'll generate a lot of heat.


00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.180
Now it's not, because of that floor,


00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.000
that minimum temperature,


00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.680
molten salt storage is not as efficient as battery storage.


00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.900
Battery storage comes in at 90%,


00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.160
molten salts come in at 70%.


00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.240
On the other hand, they're very persistent,


00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.800
they are less risks,


00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.800
they're a well-known technology,


00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.400
So if you have the materials, it's a good solution.


00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.240
- Yeah.


00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.600
- You know, but there are more, right?


00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.560
For years we've been using pumped hydro storage


00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.480
where you pump water up a hill


00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.920
and then when you need it, you let the water come back down.


00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.880
- Right, so yeah.


00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.080
So let's talk about some of the ones that are not


00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.460
straight straight of battery, right?


00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.960
So like you said, that one's been pretty popular.


00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.320
- Been around a long time.


00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.240
- Yeah, I was really blown away


00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.220
when I first heard about that.


00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:24.740
So the idea is you might be at the face of a mountain


00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.820
and there might be a mountain lake up right there.


00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.060
So you could have a lake at the bottom


00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.360
and a lake at the top.


00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.820
And as you generate the energy,


00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.980
all the extra just pumps the water to the top.


00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:34.900
And then when you let it out,


00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.780
you run it through some kind of hydroelectric thing.


00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.340
- Put it through a turbine on the way back down,


00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.400
you get the power.


00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.960
And that's got about an 80% return.


00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.540
So more efficient than molten salt,


00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.720
not as efficient as battery.


00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.220
It's terrain specific.


00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.180
- Yeah.


00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.460
- Now there's another gravity solution


00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.000
that doesn't need a mountain.


00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.540
It's called crane-based storage,


00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.300
where they use a very tall crane


00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.180
and they use the electric power to lift concrete blocks


00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.980
and stack them higher and higher and higher.


00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.660
And then when you want to discharge,


00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.540
you pick the block up and let it come down


00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.500
and spin a turbine, spin a generator


00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.340
to generate electricity from it.


00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.940
That's kind of nouveau.


00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:13.140
The current efficiency, nobody's built one to scale yet,


00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.500
but the experimental,


00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.260
we're going into 80 years of this,


00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.340
experimental, bringing in the 80% range.


00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:25.220
- So there's challenges with the water one, right?


00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.260
You're moving water up high and what if it,


00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.780
what if the dam or the pipes were to break


00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.740
and to flood the city that it was near?


00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.220
- Well, and you hit the point.


00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.260
It's also, there's only so much water you can pump up.


00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.780
Like what happens when you run out of water?


00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.900
What happens when you run out of room?


00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.060
Like now it's going to over,


00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.060
typically they're dammed water storage.


00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.860
Like the dam can only hold so much too.


00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.100
So it has limits where the crane based


00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:51.140
reach the blocks and doesn't get past his leverage moments.


00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.580
You can put a lot of blocks in place.


00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.180
You can build a crane larger,


00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.660
you can put its arm out longer.


00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.140
So that's interesting.


00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.180
Although it's, they're going to be more expensive


00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.260
and have more maintenance.


00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.420
- Yeah, you can build more cranes.


00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.940
You could dig a hole in the ground


00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.460
and have this giant block of concrete or whatever,


00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.540
go up and down, you know,


00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.300
- Hundreds of meters underground, right?


00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.820
- Yeah, well, lots of blocks, right?


00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.900
So when you have excess power,


00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.040
you're lifting blocks and stacking them high,


00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.780
and then more and more and more of them.


00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:23.780
And then when you need the power,


00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.720
you're letting them come back down one after the other.


00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.180
You have to levelize the power.


00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.140
Like there's some tricks to it.


00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.460
It's not a simple solution,


00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.200
but it works anywhere that you've got some flat land.


00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.980
- Yeah, which with a bulldozer is almost anywhere.


00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.140
- Yeah, with some enthusiasm and some dynamite,


00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.540
you can make anything flat.


00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.060
(laughing)


00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:42.940
- That's right.


00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.060
So that seems like a really good solution.


00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.340
And so this is the thing that I really am excited


00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.380
to talk to you about because I get so frustrated


00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.340
when I hear things like, well, it would be great


00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.700
if this pipe dream you had could come true


00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.460
and you could run stuff on solar and wind,


00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.820
but it's never gonna work because I wanna watch TV at night


00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.780
and not be cold at night.


00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.620
So it doesn't work.


00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.740
It's never, it's unstable.


00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.620
And there's all this creative stuff going on


00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.300
like pumped hydro, like molten salt,


00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.020
like we could just dig a hole in the ground


00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:23.020
and use some really complicated transmission.


00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:27.420
- You take the mixture of the iron-based batteries,


00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:32.420
the $20 per kilowatt hour battery with wind and solar,


00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.020
which are now so cheap and have grown a lot


00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.180
through the pandemic too.


00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.980
They're now the second largest source of power


00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.620
and they've had the biggest growth.


00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.780
And admittedly, the largest renewable still hydroelectric,


00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.220
but solar and wind are growing rapidly,


00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.700
very, very successful.


00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.000
The offshore wind power movement is an interesting one,


00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.840
where they're getting not just in the water.


00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:00.240
Right now, when they go in the water with wind power,


00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.820
they're doing near shore, not too deep, 100 feet, 200 feet,


00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.960
something to anchor to the bottom on.


00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.840
But they've now hit a point where they're ready


00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.900
to start using more of the oil rig technologies


00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.220
to do floating turbines.


00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:15.140
So now you can go a couple of hundred miles offshore


00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.580
or more off the continental shelf.


00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.420
- Right, that was the- - And run the turbines


00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.260
out there. - So,


00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.040
you know, two of the challenges that I saw


00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.380
when I was thinking about that was,


00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.020
one, you've got to dig down into the ground


00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.180
and you're disturbing the ecosystem of, you know,


00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.940
oysters and whatever, right, that like might be there


00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.740
if you're gonna mount these things to the ground.


00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.620
The other is with these giant windmills


00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.400
And when I was in Germany,


00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.800
we were around these huge windmills all over


00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.200
and just the sense of being near them is really crazy.


00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.300
- And believe me, the offshore one,


00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.520
I mean twice the wingspan of 747,


00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.500
like these 10 megawatt turbines,


00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.800
they're so big you can't even get your head


00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.180
around how big they are.


00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.520
It's just titans.


00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:06.520
But to have them on a floating platform away from everyone,


00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.100
where the noise is, where the sea life is not as plentiful,


00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.700
where the sea birds are not as plentiful.


00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.220
- Yeah, that's what I was gonna say is the other one


00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.020
is people would say, look, these are harmful


00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.500
to all the birds because there's so many bird strikes,


00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.220
but you know, 10 miles offshore,


00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.660
there's not that much bird traffic.


00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.140
- Well, now we're talking 200 miles offshore.


00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.260
- Okay, even further.


00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.780
- Well, you're off the end of the continental shelf.


00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.180
So you're way out there, the bird traffic is substantial.


00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:39.140
And so that's a far less disruptive technology all around.


00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:43.380
It increased costs, but the equipment's getting cheaper


00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.300
and the power generation is valuable.


00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.960
And it's minimally,


00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.460
they're smart enough to survive severe weather.


00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:56.460
So that's continuing to grow dramatically for a reason.


00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.220
And taking the known technology for working offshore


00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.360
and turning it into automated platforms for wind


00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.780
makes a lot of sense.


00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.380
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.640
So when I, circling back around,


00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.760
when I hear people in the news or whatever say,


00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.580
oh, we can't, we can't have this renewable future


00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.100
because there is so much fluctuation and uncertainty.


00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:22.300
I feel like it's just a lack of creativity.


00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.340
- Yeah, well, I mean, these are old arguments.


00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.340
We've been solving them steadily.


00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:30.220
- Exactly, like we put people on the moon


00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.860
with like wristwatch level computing.


00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.600
Surely we can build some cranes or build some batteries.


00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.620
- Well, we also did it in a very dangerous way.


00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.620
The way we sent people to the moon was extremely risky.


00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.940
That's why we stopped, right?


00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.780
We want power that's safe and reliable.


00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:50.020
And that's fairly, not to talk a little bit about nuclear


00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.220
because nuclear can be safe.


00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.520
It just hasn't been.


00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.340
We stopped spending money on it.


00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.100
We didn't modernize it.


00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.680
- We stopped spending money almost at the moment


00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.680
that we were moving beyond like water-based nuclear


00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.200
where stuff would fail safer


00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.800
rather than Fukushima type fail.


00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.960
- Sure.


00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.140
Funny thing about Fukushima.


00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.160
There was actually six reactors at Fukushima.


00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.120
We only, people only talk about one.


00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.920
Four was offline and one through three melted down.


00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.600
Nobody talks about five and six.


00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.200
Five and six were exactly the same design,


00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:31.080
but they had been modernized to have passive cooldown.


00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.560
And so when they were one through four were,


00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.560
and then they lost their generators,


00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.260
just like one through four were,


00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.180
they cooled down on their own without events.


00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.980
- Oh, interesting.


00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.800
I didn't realize that.


00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.640
That's cool.


00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.920
- Yeah, and they're undamaged, right?


00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.740
Now the question is,


00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.560
why didn't one through four have passive cooldown?


00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.720
Because one through four were several years older


00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.300
and the upgrade kits to make them passively cooled down


00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.360
were expensive and took two years to install.


00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.120
And since the plants only had about five,


00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.720
six years of lifespan with it,


00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.280
it was a financial decision


00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.960
not to install the passive cool downs by Tepco.


00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.080
- Probably something they wanna take back.


00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.600
- Yeah, but you know, that's true of a lot of things.


00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.400
You know, I'm pretty sure the, you know,


00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.720
in Three Mile Island,


00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.000
the operators had asked for an indicator light


00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.840
for the pressure relief valve to show it was open or closed


00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.900
and they put the light in,


00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.000
but they wired it to the switch, not to the valve.


00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.440
So you push the button, the light turned on,


00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.560
you push the button, the light turned off,


00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.960
nobody knew what the valve was doing.


00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.560
And the valve sat open and allowed water to escape


00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.600
from the vessel or was exposed and partially melted down.


00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:45.360
People make mistakes, but part of this is reactor size.


00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.880
The push to make in the 300 megawatt class


00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.720
because that's the size of the coal power plants.


00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.360
They knew how to operate that size,


00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.120
they knew how the turbines work.


00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.160
So they made these bigger nuclear reactors


00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.000
and that's problematic because they are hard to cool down.


00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:01.840
Now we've learned,


00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.720
as soon as you shrink down to a more natural size,


00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.200
to the 60 megawatt class,


00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.000
you just don't have that problem.


00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.600
So, and those are the reactors you find in aircraft carriers


00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.800
and in submarines, those kinds of places.


00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.760
And that's what you're seeing


00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.960
in small modular nuclear reactors are the 60 megawatt class.


00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.180
And these are the kind of reactors that you build


00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.840
in a factory rather than build on site.


00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.360
So they're not bespoke, they're standardized,


00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.520
they're built with machines, they're consistent,


00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.720
they're easy to test and validate.


00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.380
And so they're very reliable.


00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.360
You fuel them once, they run for 20 years on the fuel.


00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.160
So no refueling every year, you run them solid for 20 years,


00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.460
they are passively shut down because they're small enough.


00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.840
You put the control rods in place,


00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.760
they will simply go coal.


00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.440
And so the folks I think are furthest along


00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.520
in the modular nuclear,


00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:56.000
they actually got their clearance contracts.


00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.280
They got certified by the Atomic Energy Association


00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.120
last year is NuScale.


00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.700
And they actually have a contract in Utah


00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.720
to build out the first modular plant.


00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.800
And their plan is to actually put 12 of these together


00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:15.680
on the site so that you get that same kind of 300,


00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.120
400 megawatt power generation that is normal in grid,


00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.960
but they just have multiple small redundant reactors


00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.320
that they can swap them out as they need to be replaced.


00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.280
And when you, at the end of 20 years, you don't refuel it.


00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.820
You lift it back out of the ground,


00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.080
you take it back to a factory where it is


00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.720
and you put a new one in place.


00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.240
So it's a very different approach to nuclear.


00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240
- Yeah.


00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.120
It's gonna have to break a lot of stereotypes and fears.


00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:44.960
Right?


00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.100
You know, the Atomic Energy has now signed on with that.


00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:52.040
So, 'cause it has passed.


00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.720
And so, the Utah project, by the way,


00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.600
is struggling now for new scale,


00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.880
for the simple reason that costs have gone up.


00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.480
And so, some of the municipalities


00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.200
that signed on to buy power for them,


00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.920
they're now finding out the new power price is higher,


00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.560
and they're like, "Hey, I can get a natural gas plant


00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.580
"for less than that.


00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.440
"Like, why am I paying for this?"


00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.340
And that's part of the challenge here.


00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.640
Price is everything.


00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.480
Cheaper, wind's getting cheaper.


00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.880
Natural gas has always been cheap.


00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.720
And so these guys are always struggling with,


00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.300
as they develop these new technologies,


00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.840
they're trying to get those costs absorbed


00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.940
by their early sales and people who wanna pay for it.


00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.780
- Yeah, it's a tough chicken and egg, right?


00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.620
- Yeah.


00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.120
- So let's talk about some more storage.


00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.780
I do think the nuclear side is really interesting


00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.720
because it's been shunned so badly since the '70s.


00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.720
but it is carbon, it's zero carbon, right?


00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.960
- Yeah, it does not-


00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.320
- Basically, I mean, you gotta mine the stuff,


00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.480
but yeah, yeah, exactly.


00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.720
- It consumes carbon to, if you're gonna mine uranium


00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.920
or find uranium, ship uranium, like those are issues.


00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.280
It still has a consumable,


00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.120
although the efficiency of that consumable,


00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.600
it's hard to get your head around


00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.280
how efficient it is in comparison.


00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:10.320
How little you refine uranium it takes to run a power plant


00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.560
compared to the amount of coal or natural gas


00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.060
it takes to run a power plant.


00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.340
And the problem is that the reason


00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.180
that most people are familiar with,


00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.520
is the pressurizer water designs,


00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.800
light water designs,


00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.020
were really meant to produce plutonium.


00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.180
Like the reason that the United States


00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:31.480
matured that technology was to make bombs.


00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:35.620
Electricity, they get plutonium out of their cores.


00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.780
And so it was designed to be disassembled every six months,


00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.500
have the cores reprocessed, get the plutonium out,


00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.540
make new cores and load them back in again.


00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.820
And then they stopped reprocessing cores.


00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.920
During the Ford administration,


00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.300
when Carter was running against them


00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.140
with the anti-nuclear proliferation,


00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.580
Ford's attempt to get reelected,


00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.620
he said, "I'll do what Jimmy wants us to do


00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:57.940
and stop reprocessing cores."


00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.560
And America has never reprocessed a fuel core since.


00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.140
They just store them.


00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.620
- Yeah, and that's also not good.


00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.060
- No, the French, who 80% of their power


00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.340
comes from pressurized water nuclear,


00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.700
have continued to modernize their plants.


00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.320
They always have reprocessed their cores.


00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.080
In fact, they now reprocess plutonium into their cores.


00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.320
It's called a MOX core.


00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.660
And so they're actually burning plutonium.


00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.660
And so they don't have the radiation storage problems.


00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:25.860
They're not, 'cause they're reprocessing their fuel.


00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.460
And by the way, when Germany decided to stop


00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.280
using their nuclear plants after Fukushima,


00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.700
to have enough power,


00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.380
they bought nuclear power from France.


00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.300
Like, that's how that worked.


00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.380
- Yeah. - Modernizing,


00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.760
Not that, you know, nuclear plants have their problems


00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.160
and they need to be modernized


00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.440
and they need to be more efficient than they are.


00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.840
And there are better technologies


00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.760
that still should be matured.


00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.680
But these small modulars deal with most of that


00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.800
and with relatively little new research need to be done.


00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.440
And still it's a struggle.


00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.920
- Yeah.


00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.320
Yeah, super, super interesting.


00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:04.040
So we only have about five minutes left.


00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:04.880
- Yeah.


00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.340
- But I do wanna talk about some more energy storage stuff


00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.380
that's really interesting that people maybe


00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.460
don't think about is, what if I just got a giant,


00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.880
really balanced piece of steel and spun it really fast?


00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.500
- The flywheel solution.


00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.340
- Exactly.


00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:25.740
- Well, and modern flywheels are better than ever.


00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.300
These days they use air bearings.


00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.620
Some of them, I've even seen versions


00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.860
that have superconductive bearings so that,


00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:36.780
so the whole trick with a flywheel


00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.740
is minimizing friction.


00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.980
Like how fast can we get it spinning and stay in shape?


00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.260
And how long do we extract it?


00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.940
Now, they're not as efficient as batteries.


00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.420
They're (audio cuts out)


00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.820
They have their own mechanicals,


00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.340
like the stuff that needs to be taken care of.


00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.100
But essentially, they're a part of a motor.


00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.100
Like you only have to put a field coil


00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.100
around that black wheel to extract power from it.


00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.780
So they're expensive to manufacture,


00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.920
and they take specialized operators to run.


00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:12.420
Batteries in some respects, while expensive also,


00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.260
are easier.


00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:17.340
Flywheel's been around a long time.


00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.720
When I was a kid and trying to get computer time


00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.380
in the university, that computer backup system


00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.860
was Flywheel for power.


00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.900
It was like a 200-kilo set of Flywheels.


00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.260
We went down to the Flywheel room one time.


00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.460
And you talk about that threatening hum.


00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:34.460
Flywheel lets you know if something goes wrong here,


00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.960
you're not even gonna feel it.


00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.840
When flywheels disintegrate,


00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.360
that's a lot of mass moving in a hurry.


00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.000
So they're interesting machines


00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.260
and they're an interesting approach to storing power.


00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.640
I think each of these power storage solutions


00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.680
has merit depending on where you are


00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.320
and what materials are expensive at the time.


00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.560
Flywheels count on heavy ferrous metals being inexpensive


00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.520
and those sophisticated bearing systems


00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.560
to allow them to spin well


00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.520
and spin them up and spin them down.


00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.080
They're absolutely viable.


00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.520
- I feel like they've gotten modernized


00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.440
quite a bit recently.


00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:15.440
- Well, everybody, it is the Repco superconductive


00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:20.160
huge difference, 'cause you're floating


00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.320
in a barren with no friction.


00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.360
It's just not touching anything.


00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.360
It's in an evacuated space.


00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.200
The base of the main--


00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.000
- And the way, like you said, you extract energy


00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.720
is through magnetic stuff.


00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.360
- So there's no physical contact.


00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.660
- Turn gears, yeah, that's fantastic.


00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.360
- Yeah, it's a very modern way to think,


00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.040
but they make sense at a grid level.


00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.440
They need to be large,


00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.840
they need to be professionally operated,


00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:43.920
and maintained.


00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.760
- Yeah.


00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.240
The other one, I'm not sure if I have a picture of it here,


00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.200
actually, I don't think I do.


00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.280
The other one has to do with


00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:59.260
not storing water, but storing compressed air.


00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.140
- Yeah, so where we see these are


00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:06.780
where they have airtight large spaces,


00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.580
like old salt mines, for example,


00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:10.900
where they've done mining the salt,


00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.500
but effectively the space is tight


00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.500
and so they can pump pressure into them.


00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.380
They have efficiency problems,


00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.540
they have a minimum pressure,


00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.980
so you've got to pump for a while


00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:22.940
before you get to a pressure that would spin a turbine.


00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:28.300
So they come in in the 70% range, a little bit lower,


00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:29.960
But if you have the space,


00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:33.780
like the expensive part would be making the tank, right?


00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.040
Pumps are not that expensive and not that difficult.


00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.600
But if you've got a huge volume of airtight space,


00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.660
it's worth utilizing that.


00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.360
Let me throw one other idea at you.


00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.940
You know, on one hand, there's the idea of,


00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:48.700
we're generating electricity and we need to store it


00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.340
for when we can't generate it.


00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.260
Then there's also the, we're generating more electricity


00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:55.060
we need, where do we put this?


00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:55.900
- Yeah.


00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.540
If you didn't need it for electricity,


00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.420
like why would you bother storing it in a battery?


00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:04.020
Can you turn excess electricity into something valuable?


00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:08.020
And so one of the areas of research going on right now


00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.000
is water desalinization.


00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.380
We have a freshwater problem.


00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:16.900
So why not, when you have excess electricity available,


00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.220
use electricity to desalinate water?


00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:24.140
You're turning that excess power into something valuable.


00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:28.220
There's a version of this, it's actually a kind of


00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:29.700
pump storage solution.


00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.300
So we pump seawater up to a high,


00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:37.000
and then the drain system for that to lower it back down


00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.380
again actually has a reverse osmosis filter on it


00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:43.280
and just uses gravity to extract the fresh water.


00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.720
- Yeah, how interesting.


00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.740
- So taking existing design power storage,


00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.180
and instead of using a turbine with that water coming down,


00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.280
using it to extract fresh water from salt.


00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:58.280
- Well, that's a lot of options,


00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.560
a lot of different flexibilities


00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:04.340
for where you're located by a mountain lake.


00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:07.600
Do you have a mine?


00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.840
- Pumped reverse off another solution.


00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.300
It just consumes more energy.


00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:12.940
But if you have the access to energy, why not?


00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.400
And if you need the water,


00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.520
water desalinization is getting more popular all the time.


00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.800
You think about the drought that's going on


00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.800
in Southern California.


00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.320
The Israelis are leading the world


00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.680
water desalinization.


00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.680
It's a desert climate, it has water problems,


00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.160
but they don't have a water problem anymore.


00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.720
About 25% of their water is now desalinated water.


00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.400
They use the reverse osmosis systems for it.


00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.240
- Yeah.


00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.360
- The challenge is that most of these mechanisms


00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.540
take a while to get up to speed.


00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.920
So, you know, it can take a day


00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.200
to get a reverse osmosis system stabilized and pumping well.


00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.360
And if you're trying to,


00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:51.220
the hour window where you're making too much solar,


00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.420
You don't have, the system's not efficient for that.


00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.420
- Yeah, it doesn't respond fast enough, right?


00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.660
- So there's a push to modernize, to update these systems


00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.100
so that you have a 20 minute uptime.


00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.940
Within 20 minutes we can do this.


00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.900
So that three hour window in midday


00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.800
where we have more solar we don't do it,


00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.940
we can put it over to the reverse osmosis plant


00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:09.980
and make fresh water.


00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.220
- Awesome.


00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.060
- Yeah.


00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.660
- Well, Richard, thank you so much for being here


00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.340
and sharing all these ideas


00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.140
and doing the research for us.


00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.260
I think.


00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.420
- Yeah, you said it's a pleasure when you ask me


00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.380
because these are all notes I'm keeping,


00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.480
but then I spend a few days sorting them out


00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.000
into a set of narratives,


00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.900
like what are the important bits of all that?


00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.100
So it's a pleasure for me too,


00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.400
and really fun to talk to you.


00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.740
- Yeah, yeah, it's always great to have you here


00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.340
and who knows what we'll talk about next time, but it's-


00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.460
- Well, Coke's a real subject,


00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:40.660
and you know I'm interested in everything.


00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.020
- That's right, I do know that for sure.


00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:45.180
All right, so thank you for being here as always,


00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.780
and yeah, have a good day.


00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.900
And hey, we actually made this work from space.


00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.260
- Yeah, yeah, the tail,


00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.860
it seemed a little after that.


00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.020
- That's right.


00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.700
All right, bye Richard.


00:50:58.700 --> 00:50:59.540
- See ya.


00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:09.540
