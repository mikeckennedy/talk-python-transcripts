00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
Jay, welcome to Talk Python to Me.


00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.880
Thanks for having me, Michael.


00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.960
It's a pleasure to be here.


00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.960
It's a pleasure to have you.


00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.960
Congratulations.


00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.960
Thanks.


00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.960
Thanks.


00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.160
And, of course, I would be remiss if I didn't totally qualify that, that any congrats have


00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.400
to be accepted on behalf of hundreds of people at the NIF, at the laboratory and laboratories


00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.120
and industry around, and indeed extending back six decades of research that went into this.


00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.520
And so my part is insignificant, but not negligible.


00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.320
I'm having a couple of my mental models broken recently.


00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.720
For me, fusion has always been one of those things that's always 30 years out.


00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.280
You know, it's like, oh, just we know it's possible, but it's just we're really barely


00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.880
scratching the surface. And the other mental model is AI is always 30 years out as well.


00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.480
And, you know, this year of chat to P and stable diffusion and all those things.


00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:18.200
And changing. Yeah. And this huge breakthrough that you all had, it's I'm sure there's some


00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.280
work to be done. You're not there yet. Right. We're not all driving around little tiny


00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.960
any water-powered cars and stuff.


00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.760
But it shows that it's possible, right?


00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.120
And that it's a massive deal.


00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.860
>>Tom: Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.


00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.400
There are a couple of big changes here


00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.080
in just the last months, even.


00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.040
So I'm still kind of processing both of those, actually.


00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.600
So yeah, it's going to be an interesting world.


00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.480
I think as far as Ignition, it is still a long, long path


00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.280
forward towards utilization.


00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.120
- It sure is, but--


00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.400
- We can talk about that.


00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.880
- Yeah, we will, but it's so exciting


00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.080
because with renewables, that's great,


00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.640
but there's always a cost to that


00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.480
in terms of like, well, just, you know,


00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.040
think solar panels, like the mountains of e-waste


00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.640
of those things as they deteriorate over time


00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.760
or just getting them all produced.


00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.300
But I think this is different


00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.000
and I'm super excited to be diving into it with you.


00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.040
I'm also really interested to hear how Python played


00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.240
an interesting role in it.


00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.600
Yeah, yeah, I think that's kind of a fun story.


00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.680
And so I'm happy to have a chance to share it.


00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.960
Yeah, and you've been central to it, which is fantastic.


00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.360
Now, before we get into all that,


00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.600
let's get into your story.


00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.400
How'd you get into, I guess, physics as well as Python?


00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.680
Yeah, yeah.


00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.120
So I always wanted to be a scientist growing up.


00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.820
As a little kid, it was always space and dinosaurs


00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.160
and dinosaurs and space and all.


00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.420
And that's how it started.


00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.100
And then I remember, it's actually just about this time,


00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.220
about 40 years ago or so, my dad brought home a Commodore 64.


00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.620
And so this would have been the after Christmas


00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.940
buzz of learning BASIC and stuff, my sister and I.


00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.640
So that really started my computational journey.


00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.760
And then fast forwarding to I got a degree in physics


00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.880
from Montana State University, did a cosmology


00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.520
with Bill Hiscock there, and then moved to California,


00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.400
took some time off.


00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.520
I worked at Chevron in the geophysics staff


00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.080
for a couple of years, met my wife there,


00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.960
worked at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View


00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.800
for a year.


00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.500
Then I decided to go back to school,


00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.640
which is what I always wanted to do.


00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.320
I looked around, I didn't really wanna move very much.


00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.120
I was in the East Bay and in the San Francisco Bay Area.


00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.600
- It's nice there.


00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.440
- It is nice there.


00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.220
- And probably you have a family as well, right?


00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.840
Which makes it, that can also always be a tricky balance.


00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.200
- Yeah, exactly, exactly.


00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.880
That's always a constraint.


00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.720
And ultimately it's a fairly stupid reason to make decisions


00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.560
but it actually worked out very well


00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.000
'cause it made me look around


00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.040
and it turned out there was this amazing graduate program


00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.940
at this place called Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory


00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.420
run through the UC Davis, University of California Davis,


00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.260
called the Department of Applied Science.


00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.340
And so I ended up going there for five years for a PhD


00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.420
and studied gamma ray bursts, the largest explosions


00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.740
in the universe from across the universe.


00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.100
They send their high energy radiation


00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.700
from these giant relativistic mysterious explosions.


00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.620
It's very exciting.


00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.980
And I worked on modeling, doing a numerical modeling


00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.700
of neutron stars in their last few orbits


00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.900
in a few milliseconds before they coalesced


00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.940
as a defunct model for gamma-ray bursts at the time.


00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.860
But it was a great experience programming in C++


00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.660
and doing general relativity and such.


00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.540
And then I did a postdoc after that,


00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.380
and I got involved with another code at the lab


00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.660
that's actually people who are interested


00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.740
in numerical astrophysics might look into.


00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.500
It's called Cosmos++ with Peter Aninos


00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.380
and Chris Fregeel at College of Charleston.


00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.660
Again, C++ doing more gamma ray burst research and such.


00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.700
And that's what I did until about 20 years ago


00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.700
when I took a job at Ignition with the ICF campaign,


00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.660
the Inertial Confinement Fusion campaign.


00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.060
And that's where I've basically been ever since.


00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.200
Then things sort of switched gears.


00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.160
I basically kind of, I still worked with Cosmos++


00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.680
for a few years, part-time,


00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.800
but really I kind of retired my compiled efforts


00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.200
and went more towards the interpreted world


00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.400
and got more involved in that.


00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.280
Because then in ICF, the whole point was NIF was being built.


00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.720
It was still a hole in the ground at the time.


00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.840
But there were these big multi-physics codes.


00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.360
That's what we use at the lab to research our ideas,


00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.120
to run them in simulation, see what they'll do.


00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.600
And we use interpreted languages to interface with those,


00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.080
either to run the code to help steer it, if you will,


00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.920
but also to post-process.


00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.480
And so I got really involved with a few languages.


00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.040
And Python didn't actually come to the fore at first.


00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.640
I was introduced to Python a little bit in the '90s.


00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.940
I wrote a little cron job that went to the weather service


00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.120
and put a weather map of my background


00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.680
every hour, which I thought was pretty nifty.


00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.240
And so I saw that it had potential.


00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.480
But one of the languages that I was first introduced to


00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.600
was Yorick, which was actually written by a physicist


00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.080
at Livermore, Dave Monroe.


00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.520
And so it's fairly extensively used at the lab.


00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.360
And it actually is--


00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.160
it has a causal connection to particularly the NumPy library


00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.000
in Python.


00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.840
I also actually got pretty involved in Perl at the time.


00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.320
Something about it appealed to me.


00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.640
I liked its lexical structure.


00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.120
Larry Wall is a linguist and all.


00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.640
But definitely for the last 10 years or so,


00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.640
the weak couplings that are appealing about Python


00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.560
just kept coming back.


00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.800
And so I've since bitten down on that hook


00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.480
and drank Kool-Aid pretty readily.


00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.680
And so the last 10 years or so,


00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.720
it's been all Python all the time.


00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.920
(laughs)


00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.760
- Yeah.


00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.160
Now you just got to tattoo the PyKathon logo


00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.200
and it's no going back.


00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.040
- Exactly.


00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.880
- Got it.


00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.280
(laughing)


00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.640
- You have one, right?


00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.680
- That's right, I keep my whole back.


00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.880
- Yeah, right, right.


00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.920
- One thing that stands out with that story,


00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.860
which is really interesting, I think,


00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.520
it seems to me like there's quite a move


00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.520
in the sciences in general to move more towards open source


00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.640
and more towards sharing in terms of,


00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.380
hey, if you use this library and we use that library,


00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.480
then maybe we can both have a better library


00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.720
type of sharing than there had traditionally been.


00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.160
- Absolutely, and that's something that I've been


00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.920
fortunate enough to kind of watch happen


00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.180
over the course of these years.


00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.920
And I think, you know, we see that it just,


00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.800
it's just, it's nonlinear, it's just exploding.


00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.640
You know, I think one of the appeals of Python has been,


00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.800
you know, PyPI and just this proliferation of packages, right?


00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.320
I mean, shout out your Python Bytes podcast.


00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.120
I find that to be quite fun and almost overwhelming the new things


00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.400
that are coming out all the time.


00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.360
And, you know, you got to kind of keep up and pick and choose, but


00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.240
there's all sorts of new things.


00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.440
And, you know, the paradigm has shifted for me and I think a lot of people,


00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.040
right, where, oh, I have this thing to do.


00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.820
I better start doing that or crack a book or whatever.


00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.880
But no, it's like, let's find the package


00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.720
that already does that.


00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.240
And that's just a fundamental shift.


00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.920
And it's actually a lot of fun, I think.


00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.960
And you can contribute to that as well.


00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.800
- Oh, absolutely.


00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.620
Yeah, absolutely.


00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.880
I feel like when I went to school,


00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.240
I just took one or two, just maybe one or two.


00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.600
I certainly won, maybe two computer science type classes.


00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.480
And it was all about algorithms and how can you evaluate,


00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.600
oh, there's bubble sort versus that,


00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.640
or this data structure versus that.


00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.400
And it seems a lot less, not that that's irrelevant,


00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.900
but it seems way more important now to,


00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.900
oh, I can evaluate these libraries and pick this library.


00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.400
And it probably does something great inside,


00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.760
but I don't need to worry about it, right?


00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.900
It's more building with Lego blocks


00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.240
than it is building with wiring kits.


00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.560
I don't know, it's more big pieces


00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.040
that you just click together.


00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.800
And just to tie in the very first inklings


00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.520
of what ChatGPT and Copilot and stuff can bring,


00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.040
I mean, I think Andrej Karpathy made the comment


00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.880
that the new interpreted language is English.


00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.440
And it's almost getting to that point where we can just almost


00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.280
dictate what we want, which is sort


00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.960
of the next level of abstraction.


00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.400
I think that's just going to happen now.


00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.200
>>Yeah, we're past the 30 years, I guess, and it's--


00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.440
[LAUGHTER]


00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.380
But I think this is really a positive move for the sciences


00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.520
in general, that so many of these libraries are available.


00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.120
And now you have thousands or millions of people working


00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.040
on it and using it, not just a single research lab.


00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.500
Yeah, and it's nice to actually see--


00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.560
I think from my little vantage point,


00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.240
I'm not always aware of it.


00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.720
But the lab, Livermore, for instance--


00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.840
and I think all the labs participate--


00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.760
they release a wealth of open source software as well.


00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.960
So it tends to be fairly focused on high performance computing.


00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.520
It has a niche, but it's definitely--


00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.280
we're trying to give back and be part of that conversation.


00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.960
>>Nice, so it's also a two-way street.


00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.920
>>Yeah, definitely, definitely.


00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.360
>>Well, let's start our conversation


00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.240
and our exploration here with some science,


00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.000
and then we'll get back down to the Python inside of it.


00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.920
Yeah, let's talk about just all the stuff that's


00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.800
led up to fusion in general, and then


00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.080
the science and the attempts that have led up


00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.240
to this great breakthrough.


00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.800
Yeah, so like I mentioned, actually, laser-induced fusion


00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.560
has been a research area for six decades at the lab.


00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.040
when the first ideas were starting,


00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.440
when the first lasers were around


00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.360
and the first people started thinking about that


00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.340
as a driver for fusion.


00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.160
And again, this concept of fusion


00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160
is inertial confinement fusion.


00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.160
It's sort of based on the concept of taking some hydrogen,


00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.020
hydrogen isotopes, we tend to use deuterium and tritium.


00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.320
Those are the heavier versions of hydrogen


00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.320
because they have a higher cross-section


00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.200
for fusion reacting.


00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.040
And we implode them.


00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.720
So yes, you have a diagram here that you're showing.


00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.720
So we have a capsule, rather than that's


00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.780
distinct from magnetic fusion, which


00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.240
is sort of the other camp, where it's a little bit more


00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.040
like the fluorescent bulb model for fusion,


00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.600
where you're running plasma through a torus or some sort


00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.640
of a manifold like that, making it very hot,


00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.040
but at low density, and maybe something a little more


00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.320
akin to the corona of the sun, say.


00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.400
And fusion will happen there in those schemes.


00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.240
And then here, we're actually taking all of the fuel


00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.640
and putting it inside of one little capsule.


00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.520
And then we're compressing that capsule,


00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.240
getting it to very dense, as opposed


00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.280
to fusion or magnetic fusion, which is low density,


00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.040
very dense and hot conditions where fusion can transpire.


00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.120
And so it's actually sort of analogous, I think,


00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.040
to an internal combustion engine in that regard.


00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.600
So we're actually driving fusion.


00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.040
It happens, and it blows itself apart.


00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.560
>>Luis: OK.


00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.480
Yeah, so the graphics that I had seen largely


00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.680
were those big torus-like structures.


00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.080
What is it?


00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.920
There's a name for that, that T.


00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.840
>>Tom: Well, there's Tokamaks and Spheremaks.


00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.840
Yeah, there's several concepts out there.


00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.040
>>Luis: Right, that's the one.


00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.480
So that's probably-- yeah, that's


00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.440
probably what a lot of people are familiar with.


00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:35.640
And this project is focused on aiming a bunch of lasers


00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:42.080
at a really small point and just really compressing it


00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.680
and heating it all at once, right?


00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.280
Exactly.


00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.640
So just to kind of give the outline, just like you said,


00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.280
so the NIF is a big, big stadium-sized facility


00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.480
at the northeast corner of Lawrence Livermore National


00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.720
Laboratory.


00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.720
And in it, it is filled with 192 gigantic beams.


00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.680
Each one of them is basically one


00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.760
of the largest laser facilities in the world.


00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.040
And there are 192 of them.


00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.520
And they each basically work in concert


00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.560
to shine a pulse of just a few nanoseconds long.


00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.040
And this pulse goes down.


00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.320
And it's kind of as the graph that you showed.


00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.680
They all are basically trying to converge at a point.


00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.440
But rather than just a point, what


00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.100
we put at the center of this convergence of all these 192


00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.720
beams is a little tiny gold can.


00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.840
And so the can is about a centimeter high and maybe


00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.480
half a centimeter wide.


00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.320
And on the top and bottom, you put these two little holes


00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.720
in the nomenclature, the laser entrance holes, the LEHs.


00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.280
And so it's rather amazing, these 192 beams


00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.640
of gigantic lasers.


00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.140
And when they're being amplified,


00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.680
they're actually several feet across.


00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.880
So the beams are spread out.


00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.960
They're huge.


00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.400
But they all get focused down to the point


00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.000
where they can all go through just a couple of millimeter


00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.840
sized hole, both at the top and the bottom of this gold can.


00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.520
And they shine into the can, and they


00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.040
shine on the inside wall of the can.


00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.800
And their goal is then to heat the can.


00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.280
So you start with this laser light,


00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.480
and then you want to heat this can.


00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.760
And this can, we refer to it as a holorum.


00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.840
That's a German word that translates roughly


00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.340
to hollow room.


00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.260
And that's just simply because it's something


00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.020
that holds the heat.


00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.340
And hole rooms are actually everywhere in our life.


00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.460
Our ovens are a hole room.


00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.620
Ovens heat up to temperatures of--


00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.100
are infrared temperatures.


00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.420
We can feel that heat.


00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.020
We can't see it, but we can feel it.


00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:42.980
If you get up--


00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.460
we heat these little hole rooms up to actually X-ray


00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.300
temperatures so that it's so hot, they're beyond visual.


00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.580
They're beyond ultraviolet, but into the X-rays.


00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.580
And it's actually a fraction of the temperature


00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.140
at the center of the sun, in fact.


00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.340
And so we're actually bathing this little tiny gold


00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.340
can in this superheated X-ray environment.


00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.100
And then we inserted inside of that horn


00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.140
beforehand a hapless little capsule.


00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.380
And this capsule is about--


00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.500
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.340
Exactly.


00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.340
You kind of feel sorry for it sometimes.


00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.220
It anthropomorphizes it a little bit.


00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.500
But this capsule is made of-- it's a very, very thin shell,


00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:29.100
just a couple hundred microns or 100 or so microns thick.


00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.780
And right now, these shots are being-- actually,


00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.980
they're used nanocrystalline diamond.


00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.940
So they're like pure carbon shells.


00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.500
And so they're very dense.


00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.060
And so it's kind of funny.


00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.220
We have a gold hole room.


00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.660
The hole room is made out of gold,


00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.580
and the capsule is made out of diamond, right?


00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.580
And so could you have picked more prosaic ingredients?


00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.060
But these are the ones that work.


00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:57.820
And so the point of this capsule is really just it acts


00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.460
like a rocket fuel.


00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.840
And so what happens is the laser energy


00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.780
is absorbed into that diamond, and it explodes.


00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.660
It's just pretty much exactly what you'd kind of think.


00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.780
It just heats and explodes.


00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.260
And then going back to your Newton's third law,


00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.460
so if you have an action, for every action


00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.660
there has to be an equal and opposite reaction.


00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.620
If you have this little capsule exploding outward


00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:26.580
in this bath of X-rays, whatever you put inside of that capsule


00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.220
has to go inward.


00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.180
And happily, we actually put in a little bit


00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.420
of deuterium and tritium, and we actually


00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.700
froze it into an ice layer around the inside


00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.780
of that capsule.


00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.100
So that becomes our payload.


00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:44.180
So the spherical rocket analogy is actually very apt.


00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.740
So you're actually, you're having this fuel blowing outward


00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.800
and causing thrust that pushes the payload inward.


00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.760
And you try to compress it into a tiny little pellet,


00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.980
again, trying to achieve very, very high densities,


00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.420
hundreds of grams per cubic centimeter


00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.620
and tens of kilovolts.


00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.580
That's no enclature, we can talk more about that.


00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:08.580
But to get to the point where actually fusion conditions.


00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.940
And what you're looking for and the goal,


00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.520
the reason why we're talking right now


00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.600
is the goal was always to achieve an ignition.


00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.640
So for a very long time, people have demonstrated


00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.280
that you can get neutrons out of this.


00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:32.000
You can actually get a few of the billions of hydrodynamics


00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.560
in there to fuse.


00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.600
But what we're trying to do is get to the point


00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.040
where they bootstrap, where one fusion can cause


00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.320
another fusion or several more fusions, which


00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.760
will cause more fusions.


00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.420
And you get what's called an ignition,


00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.940
and it's ignition wave where actually the fusions will


00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.860
cause more fusions, and they'll actually


00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.020
cause a burn propagating front to go


00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:55.460
from the tiny center of that little assembled piece of fuel,


00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.180
move outward, and actually propagate and burn fuel


00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.260
as it goes out.


00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.820
And that way, you can actually--


00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.140
that way, you get a macroscopic amount of the fuel


00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.900
to burn to convert to helium and release fusion energy, release


00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.140
neutrons.


00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.780
And that's what we finally achieved.


00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.540
It's extremely difficult, because basically everything


00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.940
has to work perfectly.


00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:25.020
>>Luis: In 192 lasers, and probably


00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:29.220
a chaotic, dynamic reaction of some form of explosion


00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.860
and interaction there.


00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.380
It's not super easy to control.


00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.220
And there's some interesting Python planning,


00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.420
some of those experiments and stuff.


00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.460
But it sounds to me that it's--


00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:45.620
even though it's, in a sense, very much the opposite of fission, traditional nuclear reactions


00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:51.820
that we already leverage, the way that it kind of propagates and once you get it going,


00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.780
it sounds actually oddly similar.


00:19:53.780 --> 00:20:00.660
Yeah, I mean, fission, fission, the good thing about it is, or the nice thing about it is that


00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:06.060
it's passive, right? But it does operate on that same idea. If you put, you know, fission


00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:12.300
products are really close together and one goes off, then it might cause others to go off and you can get that chain reaction and


00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.840
Exactly, that's we're trying to get that to happen with with fusion


00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:22.120
But the thing is that you know fusion these particles are so light and they they're all like charges, right?


00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.760
So they're always trying to push each other away that and as soon as you start putting heat into it


00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.000
I the product of fusion the thing you wanted to get out of it


00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.980
It immediately blows itself apart and turns itself off unlike fission


00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.020
And so that's really kind of always the trick.


00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.700
- That's the hard part, yeah.


00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.540
- Yeah, exactly.


00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.020
- So you have to really carefully balance the lasers


00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.580
to keep the confinement happening


00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.480
and keep the pressure there until it takes off, right?


00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:56.620
- Right, so, excuse me.


00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:04.200
So the lasers, I'll give short shrift,


00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.000
unfortunately, there's just amazing technological


00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.800
achievements, frankly. And I'm only just, you know, I know a


00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.320
little bit about them, I know enough about them to simulate


00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.800
them. But they're amazing technological achievements that


00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.800
you can get all these to run together. And what they do is


00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.880
actually they give it they give this blast, right, they heat the


00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.400
whole room, and they actually heat it, not just like turn it


00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.480
to 450, like your oven, they actually heat it in these very


00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.040
precise stages that are timed all over the course of this few


00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.720
nanoseconds to actually, you're actually trying to, to ablate


00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.280
this, this rocket fuel in steps.


00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.800
You're not just trying to just blam.


00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.400
You're just actually, and, and doing that, you do that very precisely.


00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.960
So you're actually blowing a first step and then you do another step and then


00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.380
you actually hit it harder and really give it a good hard drive to really implode it.


00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.280
And all of that is happening by basically the light, the lasers over the course of


00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.940
these few nanoseconds, just sort of pulsing in a sense, if you will, to heat


00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.160
this whole room in these stages.


00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.060
So all of that has to be just perfect.


00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.140
It has to be very uniform.


00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.860
And then that ends up driving this capsule.


00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.980
And the capsule doesn't want to actually implode.


00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.580
And that's another big thing is it's unstable.


00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.540
Nature doesn't want to take--


00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.260
they always say nature hates vacuums.


00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.860
Nature also hates when you take all the items in a room


00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.220
and try to move them into one corner.


00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.420
It doesn't let you do that easily.


00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.020
And that's basically what we're trying to do.


00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.780
We're trying to take all of these hydrogens


00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.100
and put them all together into a tiny, tiny space.


00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.480
And like you'd imagine, just trying


00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.620
to press a balloon together, we're


00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.260
trying to implode this capsule by a factor of 30


00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.820
in linear scale, 20 to 30.


00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.540
And if you tried to take a balloon and do that,


00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.660
you could imagine you push it in and it pops out


00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.540
where your fingers aren't.


00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.780
So you bring in a friend and you push together


00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:03.820
and you're all pushing together.


00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.980
And pretty soon the balloon is finding tiny little places


00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.580
to squeeze out, but it's gonna find them, right?


00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.460
And so you have to just basically iteratively


00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.720
make everything as perfect as possible.


00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.720
And so the other hero of, I think, this achievement,


00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.900
not just the lasers, the lasers have been just going


00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.500
through these rather miraculous increments


00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.300
beyond their original design specs to the point


00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.180
where they're delivering more energy than they were


00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.660
originally promised and with unprecedented smoothness


00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.940
and precision.


00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.340
But also the capsule and its smoothness and perfection


00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.140
is amazing.


00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.820
So these capsules, if you just think of out-of-roundness,


00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.620
they're about 200 nanometers maybe out of round,


00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.540
out of a millimeter.


00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:58.740
And the Earth is roughly 20 kilometers out of around 6,000.


00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.140
So if you do those ratios, this is actually about 10 times


00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.180
rounder than the Earth.


00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:11.220
And it's just a tiny little 2 millimeters across a capsule.


00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.020
So they're very, very smooth.


00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.940
And that's something that's been progressing.


00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.260
And I would say those two achievements are


00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.520
kind of the things that had to be incrementally improved


00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:27.520
to the point where you're trying to realize the ideal.


00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.760
Our codes are good at simulating ideals.


00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.160
And we do a lot of work to try to actually simulate


00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.960
the imperfections as well and capture


00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.920
as many of those imperfections as possible.


00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.080
But we've always been able to do the ideal and say,


00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:46.120
yeah, the ideal works, the whole spherical cow idea.


00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.200
But indeed--


00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.160
>>It's exactly pie around this ideal circle.


00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.000
And of course, it's going to work like this.


00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.680
And there you go.


00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.520
Exactly. And it's like, oh, that works really well. And that's


00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.520
been the issue. And really what's happening is these large


00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.480
teams of experimentalists have been able to make the laser


00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.240
better and continue to and make these targets better. And


00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.260
they're actually getting closer and closer to ideals that even


00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.460
just a few years ago were like, ridiculous. So it's really a


00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.600
testament to that hard work.


00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.200
Yeah, really amazing.


00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.960
So what we're all learning is to collapse this balloon,


00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.640
you need 192 friends, or 191 friends,


00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.160
if you don't count yourself right.


00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.000
Right, right.


00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.600
Well, the fact that we're doing a can, like this whole room,


00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.560
is very important.


00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.440
We're not actually shining the lasers on the capsule.


00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.320
That's something that's called direct drive.


00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.640
And indeed, that is a field of study.


00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.480
That provides its own challenge, because indeed, each laser


00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.640
is like a little fingertip trying to push on the capsule.


00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.920
This is so-called indirect drive because we're


00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.440
driving the capsule by the heating bath of the lasers.


00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.880
The lasers are heating this whole room,


00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.280
and that's driving the capsule.


00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:04.780
And that's--


00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:09.080
>>So it's the-- sorry, so it's the actual--


00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.120
it's more the shell that is playing the important role


00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.480
of doing the compression.


00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.440
And you need to provide just enough controlled and even


00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.360
heating to make it go.


00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.920
Right, yeah, you want to make that, but you still need to make that heating as controlled and even


00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:29.040
as you can. And it's still not even enough, really, when you so there's been a, you have to do a lot


00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.520
of work with, you know, making sure that heating, you know, where you put the beams, where the spots


00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.880
are, which are kind of like the elements in your oven, right? You know, if you turn on the broil


00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:43.200
elements, you'll burn your toast, right? And so you have to know where to put those elements,


00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.800
where to where do those spots hit the inside of the plurum to heat as uniformly as possible.


00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:55.440
Yeah, and people might be thinking, well, compressing something 30 times, it's not that


00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.800
crazy. We do that with air all the time. You look at combustion engines and other stuff.


00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.200
But you're also heating it.


00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.920
Well, it's 30 times linear.


00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.440
Yeah, but you're also heating it to near the temperature of the sun. It wants to get a


00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.760
lot bigger really quickly. It doesn't want to even stay where it is, right?


00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.560
Absolutely, yes. You're heating it up to actually temperatures in excess of the center of the


00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.640
And then so yeah, it doesn't want to be there.


00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.000
[LAUGHS]


00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.280
>>Luis: It wants to get moving.


00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.520
All right.


00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.080
Fantastic.


00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.040
Let's just talk one more science side thing,


00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.600
then we'll dive into the software side.


00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.440
So this is the first time this has been done,


00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.360
and it's a huge accomplishment.


00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.880
How do you all see this very quick and small reaction


00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.000
potentially turning into actual energy sources?


00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.080
Where do we go from here to do something productive with this?


00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.440
Right, so it's important to note that the National Ignition


00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.920
Facility itself was a demonstration facility.


00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.060
It's a research facility.


00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:02.840
So it's not meant to become an energy facility.


00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.520
And indeed, there are other startups out there,


00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.240
and I think there are probably going to be more,


00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.880
that are exploring ways to commoditize this.


00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.000
So it's kind of interesting to think about the energy


00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.440
a little bit, if I can.


00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.720
So just to kind of add a scale to this,


00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.320
a human eats about 2,000 calories of food a day,


00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.560
an adult.


00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.240
And those are actually kilocalories,


00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.280
nutritional calories.


00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:36.380
So that's 2 million calories, which is 2 megacalories.


00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.680
And it turns out that a calorie is--


00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.880
kind of convenient is four joules, another scientific measure of energy that we use all the


00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:54.240
time. So that two kilocalories we eat every day is basically two million calories, which is eight


00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:00.240
megajoules, eight million joules. So we just multiply by that four. So eight megajoules you


00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:09.120
eat every day. So this laser is producing two megajoules, sort of like your breakfast of energy.


00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.380
So it's actually not an achievable amount of energy,


00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.420
but it does it in just a few nanoseconds, right?


00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.700
And I don't know how to describe a nanosecond all that well,


00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.420
except to know that the speed of light is a good measure,


00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.340
right, the speed of light.


00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.180
So at the speed of light,


00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.660
a light wave can go around the earth


00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.220
seven and a half times in a second.


00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.860
But in a nanosecond, light only goes 30 centimeters.


00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.580
So about a foot.


00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.780
And so I think that gives you an idea


00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.140
just how quick that is.


00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.100
And so that's the key.


00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.780
It gives you a sense also of how insane,


00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.700
how insanely precise those lasers have to be.


00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.700
Exactly.


00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.220
Yeah.


00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.100
They've got that 30 centimeters.


00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.620
The entire-- yeah, that's the cosmic speed limit.


00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.780
No information can go faster than that.


00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.300
And so everything has to be within this really


00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.340
small envelope.


00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.820
It's quite amazing.


00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.880
And then the reason why we're talking


00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.220
about this particular achievement


00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.860
is that it actually yielded a little over 3 megajoules,


00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:16.780
so maybe breakfast plus lunch in fusion yield.


00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.220
And again, that happened instantaneously, effectively.


00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:20.980
That was released.


00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:25.940
So it's more about the release that makes it amazing.


00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.140
But the thing is that the energies aren't all


00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.100
that large at this point.


00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.820
And it occurred to me that if you--


00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.820
so well, if you think about--


00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.500
it's kind of interesting to think about.


00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.060
So going back to the food analogy,


00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.980
so you eat 8 megajoules per day.


00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.860
A day is 24 hours times 60 minutes times 60 seconds.


00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.660
So 24 times 3,600.


00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.720
It's 80,000 or 90,000 seconds, right?


00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.940
So 8 megajoules divided by, say, 80,000 seconds.


00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:01.140
That works out to 100 joules per second, or 100 watts.


00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:06.300
So you as a human burn 100 watts, which is a very--


00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.260
we use that term all the time.


00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.220
And you can imagine taking a mannequin


00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.600
and putting a 100-watt incandescent bulb inside,


00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.780
and it would heat up to our skin temperatures.


00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:25.380
So but we're-- of course, we're going at a much, much higher


00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.140
wattage because we're doing it very quickly.


00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.700
So you can actually sort of think of like, you know,


00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.180
a unit of measure that we often use in electricity and stuff


00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.380
is sort of the kilowatt hour, right?


00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.740
A thousand watts times an hour, which is again, just 3,600.


00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.900
So a kilowatt hour is just 3.6 megajoules then.


00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.700
So 3,600 times a thousand watts.


00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.960
So 3.6 megajoules is a kilowatt hour.


00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.660
And not to put you on the spot, Michael,


00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.940
but do you know how much you pay per kilowatt hour


00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.140
for your electricity in your home?


00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:04.920
think 17 cents. Oh, that's awesome. I'm pretty sure I'm


00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.080
pretty sure as long as I have the units right, because yeah,


00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.060
I have an electric car, I have little stuff that'll show me


00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.580
like, here's how much you charge and how much it pays into your


00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.980
price here to get your like, so I'm pretty sure that I'm pretty


00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.940
sure it's 17. And my gun up just a tiny bit.


00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:26.980
Okay, yeah. So I pay about 25 off peak and like 45 cents per


00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.940
kilowatt hour on peak. And so I have an EV and you know, and I'm


00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.580
kind of aware of all that as well. But so again, you know,


00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.980
this this shot produced about a little over three mega


00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:42.180
joules, when a kilowatt hour is 3.6, right, which is, as you


00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.620
said, you can buy one for 17 cents. So I can pretty much save


00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.480
with certainty that this experiment cost more than 17


00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.340
cents. Right?


00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.780
Somewhat, it's gonna be more than 17 cents. Yeah.


00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.780
Yeah, so this one experiment for my one kilowatt hour I got out


00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:04.380
of-- or a little less than a kilowatt hour I got out of it.


00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.680
And never mind that there was a certain amount put in.


00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.940
I had to put two megajoules in, and there's inefficiencies


00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.500
as well.


00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.020
But so I think that just sort of outlines


00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:17.340
the challenge of scale, right?


00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:21.860
I mean, so I have to make a capsule that's way,


00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:25.060
way cheaper than $0.17 to make money.


00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:29.340
probably I want to get more than a kilowatt hour per shot, I'll


00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.040
probably want to 10 or 100 kilowatt hours per per shot, and


00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.380
then I'm going to have to have a lot of high rep rate. Because


00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.540
ultimately, to power your home and my home and a town's home,


00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.820
you know, you need lots of kilowatt hours. And so so, you


00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.620
know, scaling it up is a challenge. I think that's just


00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.500
sort of a nice way to illustrate, you know, where,


00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.260
where you have to go to get there.


00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.900
Yeah, you got to start somewhere, though, the first


00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.540
Transistors, I'm sure were expensive.


00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.420
You know, the first--


00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.260
- Oh, exactly.


00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.620
- 100 kilobytes of hard drive storage seemed just insane.


00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.540
If you told somebody, well, we're gonna need a terabyte


00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.340
on everybody's computer, like, no, we can't do that.


00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.020
And here we are just-- - Exactly, yeah.


00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.700
- On an SD card, nothing, yeah, so.


00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.980
- Exactly, but there's a lot to do.


00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.700
There's a lot of growth there that needs to happen.


00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.580
- It's early stage for sure.


00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.180
- Right, right, right.


00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.540
- Awesome.


00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.860
All right, well, let's talk about some of the software side.


00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:27.180
I know that you guys have over at the LLNL,


00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.020
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,


00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.100
you have a software portal.


00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.180
We have a bunch of different applications


00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:35.780
and things that you're sharing, which are really great.


00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.940
And so I know that you've got a lot of neat things


00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.760
happening on the software side.


00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.620
Your area has been largely around designing


00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.400
and simulating the experiments.


00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.980
And then once someone runs them to go,


00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.740
okay, I got some data, how'd that work?


00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.300
How do we adjust?


00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.020
So maybe talk to us about some of the software side


00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.140
what you're doing there.


00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.060
>>Yeah, right.


00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:03.460
So like we were saying, our design cycle


00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:08.100
is that we have these quite impressive multi-physics codes


00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:12.260
that can simulate these experiments that actually mock


00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.860
up the whole room and the capsule inside


00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.780
and actually put fake lasers in and run


00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.220
how they would interact with the gold atoms


00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.460
and actually run the entire simulation.


00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.580
But usually, you don't want to just push the button


00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:29.740
and just have it come out.


00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.020
Usually, you're asking questions about it.


00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.620
You're instrumenting it up, if you will.


00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.220
You're checking things.


00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.700
So you're kind of steering these simulations.


00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:44.100
And so one of the big facets of software


00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.180
that we've been working on for the last few years


00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.500
is to improve that steering in Python.


00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.380
We can talk a little bit more about that.


00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.580
But then also, we have--


00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.940
so then you get out your simulations result, right?


00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.740
You say, oh, well, this result did such and such, right?


00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.340
But now you want to actually compare it to data.


00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.420
And so you have to go over to a web page


00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.740
or talk to somebody who ran an experiment on NIF


00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.820
and talk to them and get that data.


00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.300
And so that's another area that we've


00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.020
been working really hard on over the last five or six years


00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.300
to try to improve that ability.


00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.320
So that basically we're kind of bringing all the parties


00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.080
together so that making the simulations easier to run,


00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.860
easier to work with, and also having the data and tools


00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.260
proximate to that so that we can all sit in one place


00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.240
and actually ask all the questions


00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.900
and get all the answers in that one spot.


00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.780
So I guess just--


00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.020
so historically, that's kind of been the design cycle.


00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.340
And it's been fairly organic, where


00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.580
People will write tools that work for them to steer code


00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.820
or to do some post-processing, and then they'll


00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.340
share them with people.


00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.860
And then somebody else will share it, and they'll tweak it.


00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.760
And eventually, somebody will quit asking just friends,


00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.660
and they'll put it in a directory somewhere


00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.740
and make it readable.


00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:11.140
And so that had been the way we'd done business for a while.


00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:15.460
And we're trying to actually improve that.


00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.660
And so about five or six years ago,


00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.020
I was designing some experiments for the NIF.


00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.820
And I was running one of these tools that


00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.660
were sort of an organically grown thing.


00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.820
And I was trying to do something that


00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.620
was a little bit challenging for it and a little bit out


00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.460
of its strengths.


00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.900
And I basically kind of had an existential crisis.


00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.340
I just thought, I can't do this anymore.


00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.380
These tools aren't cutting it.


00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.940
you know, the code underneath is great, but this,


00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.860
I'm just beating my head against the wall to talk to it and to


00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.240
get things out of it. And you know, you can really burn a lot


00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.040
of human time doing that, which is very expensive. And so I


00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:57.120
basically just just stopped running those those tools. Like


00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.540
it was just, you know, kind of like the office space thing,


00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.580
you know, where the guy post-technotic suggestion,


00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.620
right? Yeah. I just thought, you know,


00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.060
I don't think I don't think I want to go to work today.


00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.300
I don't think I want to do that either.


00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.300
Like just, I don't know.


00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.560
(laughing)


00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.300
- It was kind of like-


00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.220
- Yeah, we're good mental model.


00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.220
- Right, it was kind of like that.


00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.900
I just felt like I can't do that anymore.


00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.540
And I think my time would be better spent


00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.620
trying to improve the model, improve the ecosystem.


00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.500
And again, so I am drinking the Python Kool-Aid


00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.340
all the time, learning more and more about the ecosystem.


00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.740
Also learning just about, you know, Git


00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.420
and continuous integration,


00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.180
just things that are out there that I'd been entirely


00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.860
naive about myself.


00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.020
And realizing that, oh, there's actually things to do.


00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.020
And in all fairness, of course, other people


00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.980
are thinking things like this as well, as per the page


00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.340
you've got up here.


00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:55.820
The lab has tons of people who are doing this stuff in spades.


00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:00.340
But there are a little corner of ignition land


00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.940
that wasn't happening as much as I wanted.


00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.020
And so I basically looked around,


00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.820
And I found a couple things that other people had just


00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.860
been starting.


00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.860
And one of them is basically a Python wrapper


00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.100
of one of our codes.


00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.540
We have one of our multi-physics codes.


00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.560
We call it Hydra.


00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:27.620
And the developer physicist Joe Koning


00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:31.700
did the hard work of actually installing Python


00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.500
and a Python interpreter into that.


00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.500
So it actually talks to this big multi-physics parallel code.


00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.580
- Interesting, so it's actually hosting the Python runtime,


00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.220
not the other way around,


00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:47.220
where Python is trying to rapid C API?


00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.340
- Right, right, no, no, the code itself is running


00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:55.340
and Python is just bolted on top of it.


00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.380
And so, yeah, yeah.


00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.220
So the code is still in control.


00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.740
It's actually very challenging


00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:05.460
And Joe did a great job of doing that after the fact.


00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.340
But now you have the ability to actually,


00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:12.180
to initialize the problem and tell it it's run state


00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.880
purely in Python.


00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.940
And he was starting to build an infrastructure


00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.980
to develop our problems, our ignition problems,


00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.940
these horns and capsules and such.


00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.660
And I just jumped in on that.


00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.340
I thought, this is what we have to do.


00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.120
It was a tremendous amount of effort to build that up,


00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.860
to make it something that actually worked.


00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:34.860
But I think that it's actually one of the easier tools


00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:39.360
out there, most robust and user-friendly tools we have now.


00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.220
And so that's sort of the one half of the puzzle


00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.380
is just making a Python interface,


00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.940
a purely Python interface to run these tools.


00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.380
And again, so this tool we call Hype Hyde


00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:57.340
for the Hydra Python deck, and again, Joe Koning initiated it


00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.220
I've been really involved in.


00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.180
Chris Young has gotten involved since then, helping a lot.


00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.780
And so we basically just tried to build the entire ecosystem


00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.300
of how do you initialize the horum and the capsule


00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.740
and the laser and all of those things


00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.900
so that you can tell this hydro code to run and give you


00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.260
some results.


00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:19.560
So that's been a big push that I've


00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.780
been championing and proselytizing on.


00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.140
The other half of it--


00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.900
and this kind of goes back to Dave Monroe and Uyorak,


00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:30.660
like I was mentioning earlier, a lot of people use York.


00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.660
It's a very, very useful tool for data analysis.


00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:38.940
Again, it's an interactive tool with a very, very nice array


00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.980
syntax.


00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.540
Think of it kind of like interpreted C,


00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.820
if C syntax was just interpreted with a really nice array


00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.460
syntax built on.


00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.860
And so it's still quite widely used.


00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.180
But I think to Dave's credit, Dave Monroe's credit,


00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.540
as he was nearing retirement a couple of years ago,


00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.500
He decided that Python was the way to go.


00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:04.500
He decided that the future was going with the,


00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.380
leveraging what's out there and just going with Python.


00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.220
And he wanted to kind of--


00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.740
- It's pretty bold when you are the one,


00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.640
sorry, that's pretty bold when you're the one


00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.220
who created your thing and you're like,


00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.820
you know what, I love my baby,


00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.140
but it's time to think beyond it.


00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.860
- Absolutely, I don't think he gets enough credit for that.


00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.940
I have immense respect for that,


00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.500
'cause I mean, I don't know if I would do that,


00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:30.660
A lot of people become very protective of their babies,


00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:35.700
but now it's what's best.


00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:40.380
One of the nice things about Yorick


00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.740
is a lot like MATLAB or Mathematica.


00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.380
When you type Yorick and open a shell,


00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.020
everything you get is right there.


00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.580
It's a single environment.


00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.040
Like it or not, Python is a little more


00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.380
heterogeneous and diverse than that.


00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.380
and it's a feature in a bug.


00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.980
And so one of the things he wanted to do


00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.180
was as sort of a parting gift to us


00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:06.220
is he created this tool called IDesign that is basically,


00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:09.060
at its core, it's a Python virtual environment that just


00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:13.580
pip installs all of the packages that we like to do,


00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.900
a lot of them that we've been building,


00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.100
to create this Python ecosystem that will then


00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:24.740
talk to this Hypeide Hydra simulation layer.


00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.760
Basically, then everybody can just type


00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.180
Python and they'll get that environment.


00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:34.620
By itself, that's not all that big a deal,


00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.180
but it does actually have a certain amount of


00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.380
nice features that we've been able to build it


00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.700
into our GitLab continuous integration environment.


00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.420
We built an awful lot on it since he did retire.


00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:55.140
So you can take snapshots of the environment state


00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.260
and some other things.


00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.140
So people have told us we need to open source that.


00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.260
I've sort of balked at it, but I think


00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.540
I've made the decision that we're going to.


00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.340
So iDesign will eventually be on that page


00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.340
you were showing earlier.


00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.780
So hopefully in a year or whatever, we're going to do


00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:11.940
that.


00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.740
But another key component, I think


00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.420
one of the things I get excited about,


00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.740
and it's one of the things that's exciting about Python


00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.820
general is the fact that you can have these,


00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.180
it's an enabling technology, right?


00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.420
And so now that you have an iDesign environment,


00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.740
everybody can come into a uniform Python environment


00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.180
and everybody speaks the same languages,


00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.480
has the same tools at their disposal.


00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.360
Well, now you can actually build in tools


00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.200
to go grab data from the NIF databases, right?


00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.380
Where they're running shots


00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.460
and they're compiling all of this data.


00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.980
It's not always as easily accessible


00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:49.700
as you would like for maybe a non-expert


00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.860
in that particular diagnostic or whatever.


00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.740
And so what we've been doing is another big campaign


00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.540
that a part of this eye design ecosystem


00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.500
is that we've been building


00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.940
what's called a shot data pipeline.


00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.460
And again, this runs in the GitLab


00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.900
continuous integration environment.


00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.500
Every night we go off to a bunch of databases


00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.540
and just harvest a whole bunch of data,


00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.940
bring it in and rebuild this eye design environment


00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:14.860
with physical data, again, the tools,


00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.060
and then the ability to actually run the code,


00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.220
all in Python, right?


00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.420
All in one environment.


00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.260
And so this is kind of the--


00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.260
Go ahead.


00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.020
- Yeah, probably before when people run the experiments,


00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.980
I don't know what before is, maybe way far back,


00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.940
but when you get started, you're like,


00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:33.360
okay, I got to get the data here,


00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.980
and then we got to maybe process it


00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.520
and then convert it to this other form


00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.860
and then filter this down.


00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.440
And then finally we can get it


00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.660
so we can import it over here and process it, right?


00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:42.580
And so you're talking about,


00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:47.780
what if you had a CI pipeline that could do a bunch of these sort of steps, right? Is that the idea?


00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:56.260
Basically, so there are experimental physicists who know their diagnostics extremely well,


00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:00.500
and so they actually will take that raw data and distill it to something useful.


00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:05.140
We're really just doing the more prosaic step of going and getting it


00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:10.260
and bringing it so that it's proximate to the designer.


00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:15.380
And that's one of those things, it's like, well, yeah, right?


00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:15.980
Just go get it.


00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:20.700
But it's a huge task, and it wastes an awful lot of designer


00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.680
time when you have to chase down data for shots.


00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.600
And so this is something that we're actually--


00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.340
>>How much data are we talking?


00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.740
>>Well, it's not a lot of data, really.


00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:34.380
But per shot, you might only be dealing with-- you might only


00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.540
be dealing with a few numbers, a few scalars, right?


00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.920
And then it can go up to images.


00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.160
And it can go up-- you can ask for a lot of--


00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.000
you can get more detailed pictures.


00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.060
But even-- you might just be looking for just a few numbers.


00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.520
But the thing is, if you have to go ask for those few numbers


00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.400
every time--


00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.480
and it's not like it always has to happen.


00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.400
It just-- there wasn't a process in place to just try to--


00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.440
it was-- that was the culture, right?


00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.160
When you want something, you just go ask somebody, right?


00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.920
And that's fine.


00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.040
But we've been trying to make the culture a little bit more


00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.560
like, let's provide it and let's automatically create it.


00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.400
And I think that's been really an exciting--


00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.080
and this whole Python framework has


00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.760
been the enabling technology to allow that to happen.


00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.680
And we're just at the point now over the last year or so


00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.400
that--


00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.140
in fact, a lot of this stuff is still


00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.160
coming to fruition right now.


00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.880
You'd still consider it alpha and beta.


00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.160
But it's actually finally coming together,


00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.620
which I think is really exciting.


00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:40.260
And that starts maybe slowly changing the culture,


00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:44.500
where people start expecting, hey, it's actually easy for me


00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.700
if I just put my data in a spot, and those Shot Data Pipeline


00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.740
guys were going to just harvest it every night.


00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.980
And Will says, I don't have to worry about it.


00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.460
I don't have to field emails.


00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:58.860
Once the foundation of the automation is there,


00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.860
and people start to realize they can trust it,


00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:04.740
then you start to get creative and put more things on there


00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.900
and leverage it more, and it just makes a lot of--


00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.580
- Exactly. - A lot of stuff take off.


00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.820
- It's Pi PI, right?


00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:10.660
RIT small.


00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:11.500
(laughing)


00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.460
- It is, it is.


00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:16.060
- It is, and another part of that is that


00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.500
the design community, which again,


00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.340
I talked about how a lot of things,


00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.620
people will develop tools,


00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.340
and then they'll just share them when asked,


00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.300
maybe put it in a directory somewhere.


00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.300
Well, now we have a place


00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.220
where you can actually have your own repository.


00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:32.780
and maybe a physicist isn't all that interested in learning what a Git repository is,


00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:39.740
but we can help with that. It can become a place where you can have your tools,


00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:43.500
and they're available, and they're deployed, because we also have the issue that we have


00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:51.340
systems that are air-gapped, and so we need to have this whole distribution mirrored over here


00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:56.940
with a physical pass-off, and so we try to do that now regularly rather than just


00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:01.740
piecemeal. And, you know, hey, if you create a little tool or


00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.340
whatever, whatever it is, it's just everywhere all of a sudden,


00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:08.540
right? And that's, that's really new. And I think that's, again,


00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.460
very empowering for, for the designers who are creating these


00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.420
NIF experiments.


00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:18.660
I think people who haven't experienced it, these, these


00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:23.340
organizations, these research labs and other similar places,


00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.460
they basically become software companies,


00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.380
at least they have a software team that is


00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.100
functioning really at a pretty high level in them.


00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:36.140
I worked at a research place that had six or seven PhDs,


00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.160
and a bunch of grad students,


00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.820
and me and another software developer,


00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:43.520
and we were writing software full-time,


00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.100
and it kept getting better and better.


00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:49.420
What actually the grad students would say to me is,


00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.820
"If you keep doing this,


00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:51.980
we're going to be out of a job.


00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.220
All the software you're writing,


00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.060
this is what we do.


00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.620
And like, no, what you're gonna do


00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.740
is you're gonna do actual science


00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.380
and actually better stuff.


00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:02.140
And every time they'd be like, well, this was my job


00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.700
and here it is a button now.


00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.860
And nobody was fired from that.


00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.420
They just did more interesting stuff


00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.380
and took on more ambitious projects.


00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.220
It was, it's pretty cool.


00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:12.460
- Exactly.


00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.260
And I've been accused of that before.


00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.820
I like, you're gonna put us all on the job.


00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.380
And it's like, no, no,


00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:20.060
your job is so much more interesting now.


00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.660
And my job is more interesting.


00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.500
I mean, I spend a lot of time developing now.


00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.860
I've kind of made this my passion.


00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.940
And so I have a smaller fraction of my time


00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:33.140
doing designing experiments, not zero, but smaller.


00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.260
But I actually feel like it's much, much more efficient


00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.860
than it ever was.


00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:40.260
Yeah, you might have a bigger impact, though,


00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.540
even though it's less time.


00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.580
Yeah, it's just a lot more--


00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:45.300
yeah, exactly.


00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.620
It's just a lot more efficient.


00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.460
And it's fun to show younger people who are coming in


00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:55.100
how to do this and that it doesn't have to be


00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.340
what I consider a painful cycle.


00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:01.020
I mean, maybe some people enjoy it.


00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.620
So I like to say that I feel like I'm


00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:07.820
building the tools that I wish I had when I started.


00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:12.060
And I think it's happening.


00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:16.740
And again, we have a really great team of folks


00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:17.740
that we're working with.


00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:22.060
I work with computer scientists, Ryan Tran and Jimmy Smith


00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.340
help me build this stuff out.


00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:27.060
And it's just been really great.


00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.420
Sounds fantastic.


00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:30.820
How many people are on the team?


00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:32.980
So it's just a small-- and a certain amount of it


00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:37.420
is just people who want to help.


00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.980
So it's just a few of us.


00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:44.340
Again, Joe Coding and Chris Young and Dave Strozzi


00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.620
and such.


00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.340
And again, but then there are a lot


00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:52.700
of people who are starting to become contributors.


00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:58.060
And I think that's where the leverage starts,


00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.900
sort of a stone's throw thing.


00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:00.980
Yeah, yeah.


00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.540
And on the NIF more broadly, how many people are involved?


00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.460
Oh, NIF?


00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:08.260
Hundreds.


00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:11.780
Jeremy on the call here might be able to give an actual number.


00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.220
But it's hundreds of scientists.


00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.460
And so for scale, you have to keep in mind


00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.300
that the Lawrence Lermore Lab has thousands of scientists.


00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:23.300
So even though the NIF is a big program,


00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:27.700
it's actually fairly small as a part of the greater lab


00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.040
portfolio.


00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.860
And I guess I want to emphasize that I'm speaking


00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.780
kind of for the design corner.


00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.660
There's the experimental corner, the people who actually


00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.620
work with the hardware of the NIF and stuff.


00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:44.180
And we talked to them, particularly


00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:47.580
with the shot data pipeline.


00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:51.900
And but there are a lot of places


00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.700
that have their own architectures.


00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:56.980
You can see that with the open source page and stuff.


00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.220
So there's a tremendous amount.


00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.700
And a lot of those things are doing really great,


00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:04.360
their own great infrastructures.


00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.440
But this is really speaking towards the needs


00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:12.440
of the NIF ignition community.


00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:17.400
- Yeah, so you talked about the specific libraries


00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:21.760
that you are really focused on the work there,


00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:26.080
but I'm sure you used a bunch of standard Python libraries,


00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.560
packages that people are familiar with.


00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:30.000
Maybe give us a sense of some of the tools


00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.800
and things that were at play


00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.600
that you're taking advantage of.


00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.600
Oh, yeah, well, of course, we're using all the numpy scipy stuff.


00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.640
That's sort of a given.


00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:47.680
And we also, in Dye Design, we'll bring,


00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:52.680
we have PlasmaPy and X-Ray DB and some of these,


00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:58.940
again, these really nice physical data packages


00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:00.820
that people have developed in the open source community


00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:03.780
that now we just sort of bring in so that it's always there


00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:08.500
and maintain for designers at your fingertips.


00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.540
Certain number of us also do--


00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:15.580
yeah, there you go, the page there you brought up.


00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:17.140
>>Pip install PlasmaPy.


00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:21.220
[LAUGHTER]


00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.380
>>There you go, yeah.


00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:24.900
And a lot of us, including myself,


00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:27.820
are getting involved in machine learning as well.


00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:32.340
Of course, that's an important part of the emerging technology.


00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.060
People are excited to take advantage of.


00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:40.380
And so I install PyTorch into IDesign


00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.060
and try to make sure that's--


00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.640
which is a bit of a challenge, right?


00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.580
Because we have really large different architectures


00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.500
and taking advantage of their different GPUs.


00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.780
It's not necessarily just a pip install.


00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.060
I might have to compile it.


00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.100
And so there are challenges there.


00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.660
But we try to just make that available for the design


00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.580
community, which is cool.


00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:05.200
Because again, I mean, not to harp on the enabling technology


00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.060
thing, but we can now--


00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:10.860
and I do, again, as a research thing,


00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:14.380
I can import PyTorch into my HiPy that


00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:17.820
runs my big Hydra multi-physics simulation


00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:23.820
and have it do inference on some part of the simulation,


00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:26.300
and maybe even offload part of that.


00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:29.100
And so there are other efforts at the lab


00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:31.460
as looking at those kinds of things as well.


00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:33.240
But again, I don't know how you would do that


00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.100
without these tools that we've been building, frankly,


00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:38.860
at least in our corner of the world.


00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:40.580
- Yeah, you gotta keep building that foundation


00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.420
until everything is ready to click it together.


00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:44.580
Yeah.


00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:46.140
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.


00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:50.560
- While it's fun to imagine what would happen


00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:53.500
if you asked chatGTP to say,


00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:57.300
"Imagine, chatGTP, you had the most precise lasers


00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:58.140
"in the world.


00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:01.420
and design a fusion experiment.


00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.220
I'm sure that's not going to result in much.


00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:08.060
Where do you actually see real constructive AI applied


00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.420
to this, or machine learning?


00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:14.700
Do you have anything that you see on the radar there?


00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:18.700
So yeah, there are several things


00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.460
that it's being applied to.


00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:26.900
And in fact, I think maybe you can find some links here


00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:30.300
that there have been some--


00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.140
there's a group that sort of predicted


00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.700
or gave some confidence whether this shot was


00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:37.420
going to achieve ignition, where they're


00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:41.980
trying to learn from the experience of past shots


00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:45.580
and try to get some idea of predicting how


00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:47.780
a future shot will perform.


00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:51.780
And so those are new things that are happening.


00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:54.540
I think that the two sides of it are probably


00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:58.460
those kinds of high-level things where you're trying to ask it


00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:03.660
big questions about, what would happen if I do this?


00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:07.660
But there's the other level of using it


00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.540
to offload some of the big numerical heavy lifting


00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:12.060
that we do all the time.


00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:15.580
So we run a lot of--


00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.180
these simulations run--


00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:20.100
have massive calculations trying to do


00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:23.140
the physics of these lasers shining into these whole rooms


00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:23.900
and such.


00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.960
And some of those calculations could


00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.800
be learned by an inference engine


00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.000
and just maybe a simplified version


00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.320
provided over and over.


00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:38.040
And so there are several efforts being applied to that.


00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:42.360
Basically, train an agent to just learn


00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:49.400
some part of how the simulation should--


00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:52.000
what physical data the simulation should provide.


00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.720
And so I've worked on some of those things.


00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.120
There's more of that going on.


00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:02.200
Yeah, so there's more details to that as well.


00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.400
I mean, the way we do our simulations, we divide--


00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.080
you can sort of think of our simulations


00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.800
or our multi-physics simulations like an image.


00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:13.480
An image divides-- to make an image,


00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.440
you divide it up into a whole bunch of little tiny pixels.


00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:19.280
And each pixel has a red, green, blue value.


00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.920
And that's what makes your image.


00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.400
And we kind of do that with our simulations.


00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.800
If you want to simulate a whole room with a capsule inside,


00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.640
you basically divide it up into a whole bunch


00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.560
of little tiny pixels.


00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:33.520
But we call them nodes, and we interconnect them


00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:34.720
with their nearest neighbors.


00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.000
So they create that links into a mesh.


00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.600
And rather than having red, green, blue,


00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.520
we have physics attributes.


00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.680
We tell it what it's made of.


00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:47.480
That node is what it's made of, how hot it is, things like that.


00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:48.800
It's ionization state.


00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.400
And then we run the laws of physics


00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.520
on all of these nodes as they talk to each other,


00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.680
and then that unfolds.


00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.600
But as you can imagine, if you have a mesh of all these nodes,


00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.400
they can tangle up, and they can get all messed up.


00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:04.640
And so one of the things that we do


00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:07.600
is we have a certain amount of algorithms


00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:11.680
to try to keep that tangling from happening too much


00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.560
and crashing simulations.


00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.320
So that's sort of an inside baseball thing.


00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.680
But that's one of the things--


00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.480
then I'm one of the side projects I have,


00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.000
for instance, of actually using reinforcement learning


00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.040
to try to figure out, just by giving it


00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:30.480
a whole bunch of trials, what's the best policy for relaxing


00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:34.760
these nodes so that they don't crash a simulation?


00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:39.920
Yeah, and these things just make simulations easier again,


00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.000
right, and all of this.


00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.520
So you can ask questions and explore more quickly


00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:46.320
and easily.


00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:53.920
Right. We all know how tricky even three body problems are in an orbiting system where they can become chaotic.


00:59:53.920 --> 01:00:01.320
And well, imagine this thing you're describing is the interactions are insane.


01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:11.080
Right. And so if you could get something to predict, you say, here's a million different examples of what happened, how it started and how it started.


01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.520
How's it going? Sort of.


01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.160
Exactly.


01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.000
It started, we're thinking here, how's it going to go, right?


01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.480
Right, right. And of course, that's an experience in itself, right? I mean,


01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.800
to actually take these forays into data science and large-scale data sets and, you know,


01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.000
training in multiple GPUs and stuff like that. It's been fun. I mean, you know, I know


01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.680
people do that all the time, but it's interesting to have that experience.


01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:42.280
Yeah, for sure. There are some interesting articles of actually


01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.320
the CogSim team at LLNL and some of the work being done there.


01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.440
So I'll link to those articles in the show notes.


01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.200
People can check that out.


01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.880
Yeah, exactly.


01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.560
Yeah, go ahead.


01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.280
Oh, no, no, just basically what you said.


01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.760
That is the team I'm kind of referring to,


01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:03.800
that there is this effort to bring machine learning to bear


01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.240
on some of these problems.


01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.480
And so that's good work that they're doing.


01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.320
Yeah, of course.


01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.560
We're getting short on time here, but let's wrap this up


01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.820
with one other aspect.


01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:19.320
You talked about having air-gapped systems


01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:24.200
and not everything necessarily should be online or is online.


01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.240
You want it to be all kind of isolated and stable.


01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.400
So you've got a lot of computation


01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.960
you've got to be doing.


01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.440
Tell us just a bit about the computing environment.


01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.280
You have interesting clusters or grid computing,


01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.080
or what's the story for actually running all this stuff?


01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.740
- Yeah, yeah, good question.


01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.960
Yeah, for the context.


01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.180
So basically we have a bunch of very, very large


01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.380
computer clusters at the lab,


01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.580
and some of them are like near the biggest computers


01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.120
in the world or were at one time and such.


01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.120
I don't keep track of that, but those are all on lists,


01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.480
and there are new ones on the horizon


01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.280
that will take that crown again.


01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.680
So what we do is basically submit our jobs,


01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.280
carving out some chunk of the machine


01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.120
to run these multi-physics simulations


01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.560
for so many hours or days.


01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.800
And so we're doing that.


01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.940
We do a certain amount of that on the open side,


01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.600
but then we also have a lot of resources


01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.520
on these air gap systems.


01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.720
And so we do a lot of our running there.


01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:39.160
And so that's the exigency of moving our data,


01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.760
physical data from the NIF and our tools over there.


01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.240
So we always have up-to-date tools to run there.


01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.680
And so yeah, we have--


01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.720
and these are made by different vendors.


01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.040
And it's interesting.


01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.400
They're evolving where there's larger GPU components


01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.360
than there used to be.


01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.840
And the codes are learning to adapt to that.


01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.840
It's a fairly dynamic environment.


01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:09.480
And so that's kind of, I guess, the general run environment we have


01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.620
that we're running on a bunch of clusters.


01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:19.160
How's quantum computing looking?


01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:24.560
Any-- Are there any quantum applicable problems here?


01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.840
Not directly, from my experience.


01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:35.280
I know there are some people working on quantum computing at the lab, but I'm not closely


01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.280
attached to that.


01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:42.520
So I'm more specifically thinking like if you had a quantum computer, would this allow


01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:49.760
you, not necessarily trying to invent quantum computing, but somebody has to.


01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.760
Probably not.


01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.360
I mean, maybe somebody else would know something.


01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.400
But yeah, I mean, really we're just trying to kind of integrate these differential equations


01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.000
that describe the physical system.


01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.280
And so maybe there's a way to diagonalize a matrix


01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.080
with quantum computing that's way,


01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:15.440
way better than an explicit method that we use.


01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.080
But yeah, I'm not aware of it at this point.


01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.400
>>Luis: I definitely don't know enough about quantum computing


01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.280
to even suggest that.


01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.960
I haven't been on this, but--


01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:30.800
Well, I guess we're due now if these barriers are falling, right?


01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.520
You had GPD.


01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:32.520
Where's the trifecta?


01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.080
Come on.


01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:33.840
Yeah, exactly.


01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.920
We'll be able to try and veer it of new things.


01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.600
Be careful what you wish for though, right?


01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.000
I mean, having been able to crack any passwords, I don't know if that's a good thing.


01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:44.880
Exactly.


01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.280
I'd love faster computers.


01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.720
Wait, baking doesn't work anymore.


01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.280
Oh no.


01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:48.840
Right.


01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:54.320
Back to rubbing sticks together and sleeping on the work bed.


01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:54.920
Exactly.


01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.080
I've got my money clip that I keep everything on my person.


01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.120
(laughs)


01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:04.760
- Exactly, I'll mail you some cash in physical mail,


01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.600
get this out.


01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.420
- Right, right.


01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.300
- You're right, careful what we wish for.


01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:09.520
And we won't have much cash


01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.360
'cause ChatGPT will be writing our software


01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.160
that we used to write, so it'll be tough.


01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.920
- Well, this is true, this is true.


01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.280
(laughs)


01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.560
- No, honestly, I'm very optimistic about the future


01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.760
in a lot of these things, and especially this.


01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.520
So awesome work.


01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.360
Now, before you get out of here,


01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.480
let me ask you the final two questions.


01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.820
If you're going to work on some of these Python projects,


01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.220
what editor are you using?


01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:34.560
>>Yeah, so I've kind of gone through the litany of editors


01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.260
in my evolution.


01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.700
I started with VI and went to Emacs,


01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.380
went and used Emacs for a very long time.


01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.900
And then probably five or so years ago,


01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:46.780
I decided I needed to make a change, and I went to Atom.


01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.700
And I could use Emacs binding, so I


01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.260
didn't have to rewire my muscle memory.


01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:56.640
And really enjoyed that until, of course, last summer


01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.780
when they killed it.


01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:59.500
And so I had to look around.


01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.060
And it was funny because I had a summer student who I just


01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.260
told how to use Atom.


01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.660
And I was like, oh, this is great.


01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.220
And then I had to tell him literally a week later,


01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.860
forget that.


01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:10.900
And that thing you really love, they canceled it.


01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.500
I'm sorry.


01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.660
Yeah, just don't.


01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.660
Just don't.


01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:16.340
He liked it too.


01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.520
So I looked around.


01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.820
And I think I did what a lot of people are doing.


01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:23.180
I went with VS Code and I love it.


01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:25.780
My goodness, it's really mature and good.


01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:28.620
And, you know, Copilot, it's again, you know,


01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:33.120
it's, I'm still, you know, learning how to use it


01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.740
effectively, but it's amazing.


01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.560
It's a state changer.


01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.100
- It is absolutely amazing.


01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:39.940
- Yeah.


01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:40.760
- I feel like VS.


01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.060
- Oh, sorry.


01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.100
Yeah, just to, you know, like for,


01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.740
because we are working on clusters,


01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.020
a lot of things are remote, you know,


01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:50.060
The fact that you can do remote SSH,


01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:53.540
you know, and you can have your software here


01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:56.340
and your notebook here, and then a terminal below it,


01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:58.940
and it's all just in your VS Code window,


01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:00.420
it's pretty sweet.


01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:02.020
- Yeah, you're kind of connect to it,


01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.620
have your editor running locally,


01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.260
but connected to that.


01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.220
- Right, there's no delay with typing and all,


01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:11.300
but you are running on the heavy iron somewhere,


01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:13.260
the big iron somewhere.


01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.100
- Indeed.


01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:17.460
I feel like VS Code is maybe the natural successor


01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:21.700
to people who did Sublime and Atom.


01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.820
Those are the, I see that kind of that flow there.


01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.420
All right, and then notable PyPI package.


01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:32.060
- So, well, right off the bat, you put up at the beginning,


01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:36.420
you know, llnl.github.io is, I think,


01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.740
you know, a really good resource


01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.260
for just sort of seeing the open source packages


01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:43.580
that are being developed at the lab.


01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.880
And again, they have a bent towards high performance


01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.540
computing and such.


01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:52.200
But like I said, eventually, iDesign will be up there.


01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.020
We'll open source that.


01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:57.480
I will mention one that Dave Monroe, again,


01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:02.240
and is sort of trying to take care of us before he retired.


01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.740
He wrote a nice little package called


01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:06.720
QND, which is on this for quick and dirty, QND.


01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:11.660
And that's now being maintained by Dave Strozzi.


01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:15.340
And it's a nice little package.


01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:17.820
But what it does is actually unifies an interface


01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:21.900
for several different binary formats, in particular HDF5,


01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:26.820
and at CDF, and a lab internal format called PDB.


01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:29.140
And it's one of those things that passes the test,


01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.900
in my mind, where I've actually reached for it


01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.180
in my own just little projects, where if I need to just store


01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:36.580
some data--


01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.500
NumPy has its own storage things,


01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:43.620
but it doesn't do really good if you have a hierarchical data


01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:48.300
or if you want to do records and have things stored over time.


01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:51.760
But this is actually a simple enough and uniform enough


01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.340
interface that it's like, wow, this really works.


01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.400
And so any time you actually reach for it


01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.220
when you just need that tool, I think


01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:03.580
that it's past some sort of threshold of usability.


01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:04.860
And again, it's open source.


01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:08.180
And I think for people who do things like that,


01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:13.060
with binary data, I think this might be something that other people might want to look at.


01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:18.180
One of those Lego building blocks. Yeah, exactly.


01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:24.420
One other question, people out there who are really interested in what you're talking about,


01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:29.460
and maybe they previously thought of LLNL as just a place for physicists,


01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:33.780
and maybe you're starting to think, oh, maybe it's a place for software people and data scientists.


01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.460
Are you guys hiring?


01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:39.060
Is there a lot of opportunity for folks?


01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.260
>>Absolutely, actually.


01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:43.240
Right now, strangely, I think there


01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:49.260
might be some tailwinds after this success.


01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:50.480
That's above my pay grade.


01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:57.140
But I think that's something that should be happening.


01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.220
There should be a lot more good stuff going on.


01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:02.060
But right now, even, there's a lot of hiring going on.


01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:05.900
And so if you find some of this interesting


01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:11.380
and you have Python chops, check us out, definitely.


01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.020
Awesome.


01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.020
Jay, thanks for being here.


01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.380
Congratulations once again.


01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.820
It's really amazing work.


01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:20.940
And I know it's early days, but we'll look back on it,


01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.700
I'm sure.


01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:23.780
Yeah, thank you, Michael.


01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.740
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.


01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:29.060
It's fun to be a part of it and look back on the road.


01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:33.500
And as you say, it's still a long road ahead.


01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.820
It is, but I'll be tracking it.


01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.500
It'll be exciting to see where it goes.
