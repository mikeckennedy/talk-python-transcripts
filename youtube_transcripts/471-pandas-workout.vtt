00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.000
Reuven, welcome back to Talk By The Mii. How are you doing?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm doing great. Great to be back here. Nice to see you.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yeah, it's great to see you as well. I'm a little concerned though.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There's some possibilities that maybe my Facebook ads are going to get messed up.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We are talking about pandas and pandas internationally.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I heard that you're some kind of animal trafficker.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You want to start the show with that story? It's out of control.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It is the craziest story. So I occasionally advertise on Facebook,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
advertise my pandas and Python training.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And I guess it was like two years ago, I tried doing a little bit more advertising.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And basically I didn't really pay much attention to it until about a year ago

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
when I noticed that when I tried to do some more advertising and it said,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you are not allowed to advertise on any meta properties.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That's really weird. Like what did I do?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I looked, I could not find any indication of what I'd done wrong.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So it says, if you want to appeal, click here. So I clicked here.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And within 30 minutes or so, I get emailed back saying,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
your appeal has been checked and denied.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You will never be allowed to advertise on any meta property again.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And this was like, what have I done?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I feel like I'm pretty innocent. Just some courses and some books. Come on, man.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I figured also I appealed, someone must have looked through this.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Anyway, in poking around online, someone said to me, oh, I was caught by the same thing.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It is illegal to sell rare and endangered animals.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And they believe that since you were selling Python and pandas training,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
then you must have been trading in live and endangered animals,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and thus you are banned for life.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Well, I said, you know what? I got some, first of all, like nuts,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and yet a great story to tell to my machine learning classes.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So good on that front.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But I was like, this is easy to resolve, right?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'll just contact someone on Facebook. No one's available.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I text some of my connections, like people I know who work there,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and I finally get the answer back saying that for legal purposes,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
they delete all data that's more than six months old, something like that.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So they could not go back and check to see why I was banned,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and thus this ban really would be for life.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So because I waited a while, because it had been like a year between the ban and me noticing,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
so they couldn't do anything about it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So I was like half laughing and half like, you got to be kidding me about this.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And I posted on my blog about this, and you guys picked it up on Python Bytes.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It was picked up in a bunch of other places like Hacker News.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And about a month later, I checked, and it was back.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
No one told me anything. No one said anything.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Just magically and quietly, my account was restored.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Running to the press never helps.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That's right. But it was so absurd.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And I think it was at least like four senior engineers at Facebook who tried to help me with this.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And they were all like, "We tried. There's nothing we can do."

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Crazy. It reminds me, honestly, it reminds me so much of my App Store review experience,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
getting the new Talk Python training mobile apps in iOS, in the iOS App Store and the Google App Store.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000
They were tragically incompetent in their own special way.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Somewhat malicious, somewhat not malicious.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Like, for example, Apple, I think it was Apple, could have been, I don't know, Apple or Google.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It has to be one of them, said, "We've denied your application to publish this application

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
because you're trying to impersonate in an existing one."

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I said, "What app am I trying to impersonate?"

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Like, it's hundreds of hours of stuff that we've created.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
They're like, "Well, first you might be hijacked."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So, in the description it says, "If you want to learn Python, you can take our courses."

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Well, there's already an app called LearnPython and you're trying to impersonate.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I'm like, "What?"

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
They're like, "It said, 'If you want to learn Python,' but there's an app called LearnPython."

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I'm like, "I just don't even understand. My mind is—how do you read that description

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and think this is a trademark?"

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So, if you come up with an app called, like, "Eat at a restaurant," then no food order delivery place will do.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Yeah, you're going to be acquired by UberEATS straight away.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Exactly.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And so, we went—but you would think, "Okay, fair mistake.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Yay, okay, something caught it.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Just like you said, a simple request and a human will look and it'll be fine."

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
No, they're like, "Well, look, obviously you're doing this."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Obviously.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Let's try another scenario.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
What if I said I wanted to learn to play the guitar and there was an app called LearnGuitar,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
but I don't want to learn—the title is not LearnGuitar, just the act of learning a guitar.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
How else would you explain it?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Like, "Oh, okay, so I guess we see, we understand now you can have that sentence."

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It's just—these things are really—and you're at the complete mercy of them.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It's really—it's both comically funny, but it's also painful because

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
we spent four months building that app they wouldn't accept for this stupid reason.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And they're taking a fair amount of money off the top for whatever people are earning from these apps.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It's not like this is a charity or something.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
What I found amazing with Facebook was there was literally no way to contact a human being.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I tried all sorts of searches and forums and on, on, and on.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And I found a lot of other people who had been caught up in this sort of ridiculous situation.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
But there's no form even to say, "Hey, I think you made a mistake.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Why don't you have a human look at this?"

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Because that would cost them too much, you know, someone's salary.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Anyway, I don't want to spend too much time on it, but boy, is that a crazy story.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And I mean, we're going to be trading in some pandas today.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And so I just, I'm going to bleep that part.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Every time the word "pandas" is said, we're bleeping it out on the YouTube version.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Well, this could be entertaining then.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Wow, Ruben was really testy.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Like, all those bleeps, what was he saying?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
No, seriously though, you know, let's, let's catch up.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
We'll talk about your book.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
What have you been up to since the last time we spoke?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I can't remember the last time I had you on.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It's been a couple of years, I think.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It's been, it's been some time, yeah.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So I'm continuing to do Python Pandas training at companies.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Since the pandemic, much more of it is online, just because companies, you know,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
used to doing stuff on Zoom, Team, WebEx, rather than bringing me there in person.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
That's fine, so I travel to conferences rather than to clients.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And, you know, it sort of extended my flexibility on that.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And I've also been building up my online training stuff, both a whole lot of courses.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I've got an online boot camp that I run for Python Pandas twice a year.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
The big thing, which is actually connected to what we're doing here also,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
is I have a new newsletter called Bamboo Weekly, where I have Pandas exercises.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Sort of like the same style as the book, but every week I take a topic

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and I do it based on current events.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So if there's something going on in the news, I try to find a data set,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
a real world data set that has something to do with that.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And then we try to experiment with that.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Yeah, that sounds really fun, to see like a real world example every week.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Yeah, yeah. So people are like, "How do you come up with that?"

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And I say, "Well, I listen to a lot of podcasts and I read a lot of newspapers

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and something somewhere, like I read The Economist, for example,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and they had this short, cute article about the number of animals

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
that go through Heathrow Airport every year."

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I was like, "Wait, there's got to be a data set for that."

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And sure enough, the Heathrow Airport Authority publishes a data set in CSV

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
of how many animals go through.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And it was like 200 horses and 1.5 billion butterflies

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and everything in between.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And so it was great fun to sort of play with that data

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and ask questions about it and give people practice

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
with something that's dirty and messy.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I don't mean the animals being dirty, right?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Like, they're messy and you need to really wrestle with it

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
because that's the only way you're going to improve.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
So I'm having a lot of fun on all the training front.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I definitely see more and more use of--I'm sure this won't surprise you--

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
more and more use of Python in the data space

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
as it just catches fire there.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Yeah. It's just going downhill, picking up speed, isn't it?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
It's extraordinary.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I still remember asking people in my intro Python courses,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
"So what are you here for?"

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
They were like, "Yeah, my company's thinking of doing some stuff

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
with data analysis and pandas."

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Or at least data analysis, I think it was then even in NumPy

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
before pandas came out.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And me thinking, "Hmm, I should really learn this stuff

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
because it sounds like it's going to be popular."

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And holy cow, it's everywhere.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And the whole ecosystem is just growing and growing and growing.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
It's like people are sort of seeing pandas

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
as the underlying infrastructure on which they build their software tools

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and their companies even.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Right, or even the thing that defines the API

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
on which they can innovate, right?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Think Dask or a whole bunch of other things in that space, right?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
If you know pandas, chances are, if you're not too crazy,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
you can do grid computing by changing the import.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
It's extraordinary, just extraordinary.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Yeah, it absolutely is.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And so back to your newsletter, Pandas Eat Bamboo, is that right?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I understand why you're banned from Facebook.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It was actually my father's idea.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I was like, "I need a catchy name for something."

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And so he was like, "Well, something with bamboo."

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I was like, "Right, right."

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
It's food for thought and food for pandas.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Yeah, that's actually really clever.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I like it a lot. I like it a lot.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
So you've been on a journey.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
You've been on a journey to write a book, right?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Yes, I was convinced to do a second one.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Right, so I did a book with Manning called Python Workout,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
which was exercises in Python.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And when that finished, they said,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
"So what other topics do you think would be useful?"

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I said, "Well, doing a lot of pandas,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and people definitely need a lot of exercise

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and a lot of practice in that."

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And so I got to work both collecting the exercises I do

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
with my corporate training and also coming up with some new ones

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
as I learn new things, because pandas are so, so, so huge

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
that it's very easy to get lost in there

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and not even know what are the important topics to learn.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And so thanks to working with people all the time,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I sort of see also where they get stuck

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and where they have problems and where it's really confusing to them.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So, yeah, so 200 and some odd exercises later.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
By the way, I'll just tell you why did it come out when it came out,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
because I'm terribly bad at deadlines.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I said to the Manning people, "I really want to have it at my booth at PyCon."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
They said, "Okay, big talker. You want it mid-May, huh?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
So you'd better have everything done."

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And they sort of backtracked on the calendar and said,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
"Okay, so you'd better have the whole thing done by December."

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And then finally I had some fire under me and got it done.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I suppose to them.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I should get more done.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Yeah, the version I actually have in my Apple Books here I pulled up

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
is the Manning Early Access Preview version,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
but it's out for real now, yeah?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Here, I've even got the paper copy here.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
What?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I know, I know.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
That's a pretty hefty book, honestly.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
That's a proper book.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I know, I know.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
It's really quite some feeling there.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I guess I really finished it.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Congratulations.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So I wanted to talk to you about maybe just kind of following on

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
with your Bamboo idea.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Like give us some examples.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Give us some problems that people are solving with Pandas.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
I mean, we're not going to talk through the code super detailed,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
but you could say like this aspect or this feature of Pandas,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
like .loc or whatever, is how you access and solve these problems, right?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
So just kind of exploring that space.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I had Wes McKinney on four or five episodes ago, something like that,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and I was just like, how do you learn Pandas?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It's like so big, you know?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So I've actually changed -- well, let me first say I'm definitely one of

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
those people who thinks you should learn Python before Pandas.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Like I definitely think that knowing the language well will serve you

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
very, very well in all sorts of weird small ways necessarily.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
But at the same time, when you learn Pandas,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
you have to learn that some of the paradigms you learned,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
like some of the idioms from Python, are not appropriate.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
So I was giving a class in like optimizing Pandas,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
like a short class, what I call a micro class, like 90 minutes long,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
about a year or so ago.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And at the end, I was like, oh, and by the way,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
obviously just never do for loops.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Everyone's like, wait, wait, wait, what?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I said, what do you mean what?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And they were like, we were taught in our intro to Pandas class

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
that you should do a for loop to do anything across the data frame.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And I was like, okay, what?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
How can this be?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And so people think that because it's in Python,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
you should do it the same way.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
But there are all these different idioms,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
especially with vectorization, that you need to internalize.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Otherwise, as I like to say to people,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
you should hope to be paid by the hour because like these things are just

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
going to take forever to run.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And so people don't necessarily understand sort of how to approach

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Pandas stuff.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And then they don't understand sort of, let's see, I mean,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I'll give like outline and then we can sort of go into it.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Certainly how to access things with .lock.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Certainly how multi-indexes work.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
How to work with the different D types.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Because these are things that we don't think about in the standard Pandas

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
world each day.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
The closest analogy would maybe be that where you're working with a

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
dictionary, you want to think about what your keys are going to be.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
But even then it doesn't come close to it.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So like .lock, people are like, so fine.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So .lock is used for retrieving from a series or retrieving from a data

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
frame.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
But it's so much more than that because you have two parts to it,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
potentially two parts.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
You have the row selector and you have the column selector.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And each of those can be an individual name, a list of names,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
a Boolean series, or even a Lambda.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And you can mix and match those in so many different ways.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And once you see those options, like your head sort of explodes with,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
oh, wait, I never thought that I could access my data like that.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And then you're like, wait, you can also assign your data like that.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And then they're just sort of astonished.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Yeah, it's really wild.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I think Pandas has its own idiomatic style that is different than what you

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
would call Pythonic, right?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Like it's Pydantic?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I don't know what the name is.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Idiomatic Pandas, right?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Where there's things that are specific to Pandas,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
like this vectorization stuff, right?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Instead of looping over, right, you know,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
you think about the Python performance angles or the data science

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
performance angles, right?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
A lot of the speed that we get out of tools like Pandas and NumPy and

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Polars and others is because you take the data,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
you push it down into some native layer and you just leave it there.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And you kind of speak to the native layer from Python.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And you say, deep down in your insides, you got this thing,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
multiply all 1 million of them by 2 or whatever, right?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
But if you loop over it, you're like converting it out of C into,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
you know, Python objects.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Then you're operating it, then you're putting it back,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
like just, you know, 2 million times.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And all of a sudden all those benefits are gone.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And so certainly learning those types of things.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I mean, the vectorization, I think most people get pretty soon,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
although it sounds like not necessarily everyone.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I was really flabbergasted.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But there's way more than that, right?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
That's just probably the most obvious thing.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Right, right.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I mean, so like accessing things in that way, by the way,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
you asked before, like,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
how should people even approach learning Pandas?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And so I've started thinking about it a little differently based on

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
feedback from people that I would sort of walk through it.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Okay, here's a series, here's a data frame.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And after creating some, you know, fake ones with, you know,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
made up numbers or random numbers,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
then we'll start reading in files and then we'll do this and then we'll

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
get to visualization.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And a student of mine said, you know,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
you're sort of missing the big,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
like people miss the big picture doing that and they want to get the

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
excitement.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Why don't you start with read a CSV file,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
visualize it right there inside of Jupyter,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and then people will be so impressed and amazed.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And then you fill in the gaps.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And so I started doing that a bit.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And I think that has not been a bad approach to catch their attention,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
give them a sense of what the possibilities are.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I'm like, okay,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
let's now walk through each of these little pieces and build up to what we

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
saw that first day.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And that's been fun.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Yeah.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I totally agree.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
That's also something that I really strive for.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I don't always do whenever I'm doing presentations, but you know,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
just because someone is chosen to sit in a seat for a day long course or an

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
hour long presentation doesn't mean that they couldn't use a little

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
inspiration. Right.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And if you can like, wow,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
you did those three lines and now we have this picture and I understand all

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
that, like, tell me more, right.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
That right there.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Right.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Now you have their actual attention the whole time and they're enjoying it.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And it's yeah.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
It's so often there's like, well, in order to show you the nice stuff,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I got to give you every level of details.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Like, no, you don't, you're going to, you're going to make them leave.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Don't do it that way.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
That's right.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And you mentioned like three lines of code.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
One of the amazing things about pandas is how often you can write very,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
very little code, but it's like getting to that code.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
That takes a while really taking advantage of it.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Yeah.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
So we've been knowing that it's possible.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Right, right, right, right.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
People don't even know.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
So a lot of times, like I've been using it now for long enough that I sort

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
of intuit, oh, there's gotta be a method that does this.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Like someone has encountered this problem before.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
And so either there's a method or there's an option or there's an add on

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
like something somewhere that just makes it trivially easy.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And that's part of the exploration that I try to do both in the book,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
and weekly, like in my training, and also truth be told,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
I'm constantly learning stuff, right?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Like it's,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
it's a rare for me to teach and not discover some option or some method

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
that I did not know about because it's just so incredibly vast.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Yeah.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Or pandas two comes out or something like that.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Yes.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Yes, indeed.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
I mean, I've been exploring, I mean, tomorrow,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
tomorrow I head off to Prague for EuroPython where I'm giving a talk on

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Pyarrow in pandas.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And so I've been looking into that a lot and oh boy, right.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I mean, I've been using it for say a year or so, but it's amazing.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
And yet there are all these subtle changes that are happening in pandas as

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
a result that you need to know about it.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
You need to expect when, when you use it,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
but it's another like tool in our toolbox that we can pull out to make pandas

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
more effective, more efficient, deal with larger data,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
and also interact with other and interoperate with other systems.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Yeah, sure.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
As I said, the whole ecosystem is just exploding.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
It's really quite something to see.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Yeah, it really is.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And I think the pandas two stuff is going to make a pretty big difference

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
changing like the internals away from just, you know,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
tables of numbers and basically, okay.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Let's talk about, so,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
so the way I thought we could maybe explore this pandas workout book is

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
let's just pick some fun exercises that you put together and,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
and talk about them.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Like give us a quick overview of what the workout aspect of this book means

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
anyway, then we'll, we'll pick the first one.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Sure.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
So the idea is that you can't learn everything all at once or quickly.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
That's sort of like, you know, working out physically.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
It's a long haul and every day you get a little better, a little stronger,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
a little more flexible.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And so if you see, you know,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
your pandas learning journey as it's going to take me several months,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
not going to take me a day.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Then if every day you do a little bit of practice,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
you learn something new in some new direction.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
At the end of that journey,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
you're going to be able to solve many,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
many more problems in better, more idiomatic and,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
and more efficient ways.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And you'll be able to put these pieces together in ways that you didn't even

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
expect. So that's, that's the basic idea.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And so the book is divided into, I want to say 12 chapters.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
I know we sort of rejiggered it at some point where each chapter focuses on a

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
different aspect of pandas.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
But it's really sort of the, the total experience of going through it.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And so we have 200 exercises.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Plus there's like a, for lack of better term, a midterm and a final,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
like a meteor projects that people can go through that people ask for after the

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Python book.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And each exercise then has not only the main exercise where I pose a problem,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
I give an explanation, I give an answer, note the order.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
The answer comes at the end. So you won't peek as easily.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
We talked about putting in the back of the book and like,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
that just didn't work out so well.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
So at least you have to wait through the explanation a little bit or turn the

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
page. And then after,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
you can buy the one book with the questions.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
You can buy, oh, are you serious? Okay.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
You can buy the answers later.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
I was joking. I didn't, I didn't mean,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
I didn't mean to give anyone ideas. I'm joking.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
No, no, it's fine. And then like after the answer,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
we have three, what we call beyond the exercise, which are, okay,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
now that you've kind of gotten the basics,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
let's push either on the same data set or even like,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
like sort of go farther. And so it's like,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
that's why we say it's 200 exercises because it's 50 official exercises,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
another three for each one. And those tend to be much harder.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
And I don't give a full explanation,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
although I do give the solution online in the Jupyter notebook,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
you can download Jupyter for,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
for all these things and see how I solved it. And for many of them,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
there's a link to the pandas tutor. I think, yeah,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
you've definitely spoken to Philip Guo in the past.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
So yeah, it's not only a Python tutor, a pandas tutor, he and his team,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
it's amazing. And so you can just click on a link and it will take you to,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
usually a miniature version of the data set because it's too big for pandas

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
tutor. And then you can sort of see the visualization,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
how these things work.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Yeah. I haven't, I don't think I've talked about pandas tutor.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Maybe I have talked to Philip about it,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
but I've certainly used it in some of my courses, but

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
it's worth bringing up just to talk like to see how that thing works.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
It's, it's something special, this thing,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
it really gives you some deep understanding into like, okay, if I run, you know,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
this group by command,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
then here's how all the pieces like flow back together.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And so you're using this during your book.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
So, yeah. So, I mean, every exercise has a link in the solution.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
You click on it and brings you to the code that I use usually again,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
sort of miniature version of the code,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
miniature version of the data set that you can then see the visualization

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
there in, in your browser.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Nice. Yeah. Cause you've got a basic, I think, encode the data, the URL.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
So it can't be too much.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Right. Right.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
So I would like basically take the data in the data frame,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
turn it into a Python dictionary and then like set it up because it won't

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
work with files for security reasons.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So assign that dictionary to a variable or no, no, I'm sorry.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
I turned to CSV in a string and then assign that string to a variable and

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
then I would read it in and then I would see if it overflowed the pandas

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
work out that pandas tutor limit.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
And if it did that sort of iterated until I got it small enough to fit in

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
there and big enough to be useful and interesting.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
I took a few iterations.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
That's cool. No, but it's a super, super good resource.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
We're learning pandas. I also think for exploring, right?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Like you end up with some code that like,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
I'm not really sure what this does, or this is actually new to me.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Like a lot of things you might encounter in this book.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Let me visualize that. Right. Because.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Right. Right.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
I mean, I, as I said, like I do a lot of training in pandas and very often

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
people have already played with it a bit, used it,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
even use it for a year or two. And because it's so large,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
like it's not unusual for someone to say, Oh, I,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
I had no idea this functionality existed.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Why have I been wasting my time doing X and Y and Z? Yeah.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
And I'll give you one, one example that I've been using more and more.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
So, you know, Matt Harrison's a big fan of the method training approach.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
And at first I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Matt, whatever. Like, like, yo,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
stop pushing out on everyone.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Fluent interfaces.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
And then I was like, actually,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
this is a great way to build things up little by little line by line.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
And I can use this. It's pedagogically very useful. Cause I say, okay,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
let's think about how we want to break down this problem. We'll do this.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Then we'll do this. Then we'll do this.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
And then we'll do this. And then we'll do this.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
And then we'll do this. And then we'll do this.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
And then we'll do this and then we'll do this.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
>> It does.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
So it takes what would be multiple step things

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
and lets you turn it into one of those change expressions

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
because instead of defining a function somewhere else,

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
you can just put it in line as part of a lambda

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
and just keep on going, you know?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
>> That's right.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
And the fact that -- so it's especially useful, I find.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
So we mentioned dot lock earlier.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
So dot lock allows you to choose rows.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Let's start with that.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
And so I can pass it a lambda.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
And that lambda then gets the data frame you're working on

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
as an argument.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
And then whatever it returns, if it returns a Boolean series,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
then it allows you to filter.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Well, you can then have multiple dot locks

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
and multiple lambdas in a row to do successive filtering.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And yes, that is less efficient than doing it all in one fell swoop.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
But boy, oh, boy, it's easier to think about

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
and it's easier to use.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
So you just like whittle it down, whittle it down, whittle it down,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
each line with its own lambda.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
And so understanding how to do that,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
understanding why it's important that the lambda

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
-- inside the lambda, you're using the temporary parameter

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
from the lambda as opposed to the overall variable

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
for your data frame because you're chaining it,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
that's useful as well.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
>> Well, 100%.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
And then you can also like comment out certain lines at the end

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
and see what the intermediate values are.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
And so you say it's less efficient.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
It's less computationally efficient.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
It might be more efficient as a human being

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
trying to understand what the heck is happening, right?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
And that is spot on.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
I often tell people that I think Python is a language for an age

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
in which computers are cheap and people are expensive

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
because like, right, our efficiency is the big bottleneck

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
in terms of time, in terms of money.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
So, right, if it takes my computer a few seconds more,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
who the heck cares?

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
>> My M2 Pro doesn't care if it's like a tiny bit more.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
I don't care.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
>> That's right. That's right.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
>> Or my cluster of GPUs, take your pick.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Although at that point it starts to cost real money

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
to burn those things, you know?

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
>> Right, but still, I mean, depending on, look,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
if you see that your computation is taking a long time, okay,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
so then you sort of find that and you improve that.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
>> Yeah, that's a really good point.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Like a lot of things are, don't worry about that

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
until it's actually going to become a problem.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
It looks slow.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
It turns out it's probably a blink of an eye.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
All right, let's keep moving on.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
We have a plethora of things to work with.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
I kind of want to go to wine words.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
>> Wine words, oh.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
>> Wine words, all right.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Let me remember what exercise that is.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
That is 37. All right.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
>> Yeah. So people think of pandas, not wrongly,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
as being great at working with numbers.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
But it turns out that it's fantastic

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
at working with two other kinds of data types.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
One is strings and one is dates and times.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
And you can get a ton, a ton out of analysis

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
working with these if you know how to work with it.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
So there is, I forget where it is,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.000
like there's a machine learning archive of data sets.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000
And one of them is 150,000 wine reviews from Wine Magazine.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
And so I said, okay.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
>> Is it Kaggle maybe or is it somewhere else?

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
>> I think Kaggle has a version of it,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
but I think it's elsewhere.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
>> Wine Magazine, 150,000 reviews, okay.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
>> I don't know. I'll find out where it is.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Anyway, so I said, okay, let's find out.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Because you drink a bottle of wine

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
and you read the back and you sort of

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
roll your eyes at what they've written.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Although I'll put in a plug,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
I read this fantastic book a few years ago

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
called Cork Dork by this journalist

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
who decided to become a sommelier

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
and she took the exam and her journey toward there.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
And she convinced me these words actually have real meaning

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
and people are very serious about it.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
So I will not roll my eyes quite as much anymore.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
>> I'm getting a hint of nutmeg, but they're troubling.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
>> Yes.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
>> They don't belong.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
>> So the question was, okay, what about these reviews of wine?

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
What words are people using?

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
And are they using certain words more with California wines

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
and certain words more with French wines

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
or certain words more with red or with white or rosé?

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
And so we can then take this text,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
break it apart and search for it.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
And we can search for it using plain old Panda stuff.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
We can search for it using regular expressions,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
which it has built in and works very well.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
So here, so let's see, something else on the words.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Here, so one of the 10 most common words for red wines.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Right, so how do we do that?

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Well, we have to take the description and break it apart.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
And if you're used to using just plain old Python,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
you're like, oh, well, I guess I'll break that

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
into a list, but now what?

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Now I have a series of lists.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Now what do I do?

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
And so one of the key methods to know here

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
is something called explode.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
And explode is let's take a series of lists

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
and turn that into a very, very, very long series.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
And so basically each element in the list

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
becomes an element in the series,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
and they all share an index.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
So you know where they're originally from.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
And then, you know, the world's your oyster.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
So you can get rid of punctuation.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Right, so I have a s.str lower.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Okay, so we lowercase everything.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Then .str split, and we split into a list.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Then we say explode, get into a long series.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Then we once again run strip, get rid of punctuation.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
And now we can use is in,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
which is yet another fantastic Pandas method

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
to say are these words in,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
like find the lines where these words are located.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
And then we can just do a value count,

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
definitely my favorite method.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
How often does this thing show up?

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000
And then we use head, ta-da,

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
we've got the 10 most common words there.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
And when you break it down like that--

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
- The most common, the counts,

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
the value counts sorts probably most,

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
most common to least common, right?

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
So value counts not only does it count

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
how often something shows up,

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
but exactly, it sorts it from most common to least common.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
So then you just use head--

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
- So then head is, yeah, if you want, yeah,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
however much you take there, and then that's the ones.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Those are the popular ones.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
- So here I have like, you know,

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
the page we're looking at.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
So we get find where the country is France.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
So that's the row selector.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
And we want the console to be description.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
So we only want the description.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000
And then we have our function top 10 words,

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
which did what I just described.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000
We're gonna take these common wine words,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
lowercase them, get rid of the punctuation, so forth,

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
pass it in, and we get back our top words.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
And we find out what words are used to,

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
are associated with French wines

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
as opposed to California wines,

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
and so on and so forth.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000
So that's a very, very cool example.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000
All right, I think we got time for two more to go through.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Do you wanna pick two that are popular?

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000
- Let's see, let's see.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Let's do maybe 32, multi-city, actually, yeah.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Oh, you know what, actually--

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
- Multi-city tippers?

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
- Yeah, let's do best tippers.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
- Best tippers, all right.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
- Yeah, you mentioned tipping before.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
- All right, let's do 42, let's go.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
- No judgment here, folks.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
All right, so the question is,

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
so we'll try to understand as we're here,

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
when people tip their taxi drivers more generously.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
All right, so the question was,

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000
did they tip better, and we looked at 2019,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
before the pandemic, in January and July.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
So do they tip more in the winter,

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
or do they tip more in the summer?

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
And so this involves several things.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000
First of all, it involved using dates and times.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Again, one of these things that Pandas is just amazing at,

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000
that people are not aware

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
of all the flexibility you have there.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Another thing is how easy it is to create a new column.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Right, so we spoke before a bit

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000
of how you can use broadcasting to just multiply.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
I have a column, multiply it by something,

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
or a column, add it to another column.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
But you can create a new column just by assigning to it.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Again, it's sort of like assigning to a dictionary.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
It just then is there.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
And so you can calculate the percentage

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
that people tip, put that in a new column,

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000
and then say, "Well, let's now group by the month,

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000
and let's find out what percentage people group by."

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
- Take the mean or the max or the deviation.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
- Exactly, exactly. - Yeah, okay.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
- And we can find out whether people tip more, on average,

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
in January or in July.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000
I honestly don't remember what the answer is,

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
(laughing)

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000
which will hopefully not tick off too many readers.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Here we go, let's see what it says.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Oh, here we go, go back one page there.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000
So 32% of taxi riders in New York don't tip at all.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
That's right, that was a surprising thing to me.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
And then I don't remember exactly what it was

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
the different months. - Yeah.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
And you're talking summer versus winter,

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
there's probably a tourism angle

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
versus non, locals versus tourists.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
I mean, I know people go to New York

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
not in the summer, but not as much, I imagine.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
- That's right, that's right.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
- It's a little colder there. - There are all these

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
different factors that come into it.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
- Yeah, one of the things, kind of takeaways I'm feeling

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
as we were talking about all these is like,

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
there's a lot of interesting questions

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000
that can be asked and answered really quickly

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000
for like sociology and urban planning

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000
and all kinds of interesting questions

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
that don't feel like programmer questions.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000
- Yes, so, you know, I mean, I talk to a lot of people,

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
you probably do too, who are like interested

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000
in advancing their careers with Python.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
And they're like, well, you know,

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
I don't have a computer science background,

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
can I get a job as a programmer?

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
And their vision of a programmer is either someone

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
working at a startup or at like one of the big companies,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Google, Amazon, Facebook, and so forth.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000
I say to them, look, there are an awful lot of people

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000
who have great jobs working at supermarket chains

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000
and insurance companies in the backroom analyzing data.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
And they are crucial,

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
but we don't think of them as programmers.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
And in governments and cities and weather forecasting,

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
like everyone nowadays is using data

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
and collecting and analyzing it.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000
And having these skills either gives you abilities

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000
to do your job better, or gives you the ability

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
to move into a new job that you couldn't have done before

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000
that these places are desperately looking to fill.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
- Yeah, I totally agree.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
I can't remember which episode it was.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
I didn't name it right.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000
So here's an episode I did quite a while ago

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
where I had our programmers and our data scientists

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
and Python data scientists working together.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000
And I think it was the research arm of Kroger maybe

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
that had like 200 data scientists.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
- Wow.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000
- That's a proper group of data scientists.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
I mean, a lot of times data scientists,

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
I feel like there's a couple of them for a company

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
compared to a software team or something.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
- No, and I tell people also,

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
it's worth learning to write

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
and it's worth learning to speak,

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
not because you're gonna be like, you know,

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
a Pulitzer Prize winning writer,

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
not because you're gonna be like, you know,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
whatever prize you would get for like speaking well,

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
just because having these skills

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
makes you more effective at your job.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
And people who can write a program

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
to suck up some data, analyze it,

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
and come back with a result,

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
especially if it's like a public data set

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
that has something to do with what they're working on,

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
they are so much more valuable to their company

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
than they would have been otherwise.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
So I found it because I have a search engine

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
on Talk Python that searches the transcripts

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
on top of everything else.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
If you wanna know something, people,

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
about historical shows, when you hit search,

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
it's not just like the show notes.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
So scaling data science across Python and R,

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.000
episode 236, with Ethan Swan, Bradley Boekme,

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000
and the company is 84.51 degrees.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000
- Oh, I've seen that thing before.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it was.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
I would check that out if there's interested.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
- Very, very cool.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
- Yeah, super cool.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Okay, last one.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
What are we doing?

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
- Let's do cities.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
- Cities, what number is it?

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
- 43.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
So I found a few years ago this JSON file

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
containing the thousand largest cities

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
in the United States.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000
So first of all, good to work with JSON

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
'cause people need to know how to work

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000
with JSON.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Second of all, okay, let's not look at the numbers

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000
so much as let's do some plotting.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000
And so I'm going to make enemies now.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
I really cannot handle matplotlib.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000
I find it, it's like so incredibly powerful

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
and anytime I wanna do even the tiniest thing with it,

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
I have to look up the documentation

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
and remind myself how it works.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Maybe it's 'cause I don't use it enough.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
And so I just use the pandas interface

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
90% of the time, let's call it 90% of the time.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
The rest of the time I usually use Seaborn.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000
So I said, okay, let's see if we can do some plotting here

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
of these largest cities.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
So for example, let's see growth in Pennsylvania cities.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Like which cities in Pennsylvania?

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Oh, I'm sorry, like let's see a dual bar plot.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
How many large cities are in each state?

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Okay, well, that's a group by, right?

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
So you have to know how to do grouping.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
You have to know what you're grouping on

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
and how to use count as opposed to mean, right?

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
That count even exists.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000
So if you wanna do a bar plot

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
where it's sorted from smallest to largest,

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
you gotta know how to do sorting.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
And then we can do a bar plot.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
So sure enough, you do a dot plot dot bar on your series,

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
kablam, you have a bar plot right there.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
And you can get it in, like, you know,

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
it's nicely sorted there.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
- Quick takeaways.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Holy cow, does California have more big cities

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
than I realized?

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
And you know, where's New York and New Jersey?

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Like it's way down the line.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
You think of those as having like

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
a lot of mass cities.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
- That's right, that's right.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
But it's how many cities, right?

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
So, right, right, right.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
So keep going.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
So like do a bar plot of growth in Pennsylvania.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
So how are we gonna do that?

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Well, wait a second.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
If we wanna do growth, it's a percentage.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
But it's written in the JSON as number

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
and then percent sign.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
That's a string.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
So we're gonna have to get rid of the percent sign.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
And then we're gonna have to change the D type

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
from string to a floating point.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000
And then we can graph it.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
- So the S type changing the D type

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000
basically is deep down inside of Pandas

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
parse as an integer operation, right?

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Rather than looping over and parsing or whatever.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Like basically, I mean, it has to do the looping.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
It's doing the looping there at, you know,

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
as I like to say, below sea level.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
- Yeah, below sea level.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Down by the Dead Sea, I see, okay.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.000
- And so you see here, like this bar plot,

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
now we have a whole bunch of cities

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000
that have gone down in size

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
and a bunch of cities that have gone up in size.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
And Pandas is very happy to, you know,

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
show the bar plot there.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
You know, again, sorted so that we see it

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
from the greatest sort of shrinkage

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
to the greatest growth.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000
- Right, with Pittsburgh having the most shrinkage

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
and Allentown having the most growth,

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
I would have not guessed that.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
- I would not have either, given that like

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
my sister-in-law and brother-in-law live in Allentown

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
and they're like, "Oh, Allentown."

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
But I think that's a common thing

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
that people think there, even though it seems

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
like a perfectly great place to be.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
- Yeah, sure.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Funny.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000
- Awesome.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000
- Well, there's a lot of quick takeaways from this.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
- One more, let me just show you one more.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Go to the last one here in this exercise.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
- Okay.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
- So one of the most important types of plots

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000
you can do in data analysis is a scatter plot.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000
And you take your data frame and you say,

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000
"Give me the plot with, based on your, you know,

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
"the X axis should be this, the Y axis should be that."

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Well, if we do a scatter plot based on longitude

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000
and latitude of the thousand largest US cities,

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
you basically come up with a map of the US.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
- Yeah, how interesting.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
The other thing that you realize is California

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
is technically bigger than a lot of other states.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
So that also counts for why.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
- Oh, yes.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
- Yeah, interesting.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But there's a lot of people in California.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
It's a good place to be.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
- There are a lot of people there for sure.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
- If they're willing to pay the sunshine tax, it's nice.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
(laughing)

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Cool, all right, Reuven.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
This is really, really excellent.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I know you want to give a shout out

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
to a couple of exercises from Bamboo Weekly.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
So I'll include those in the show notes as well.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And people can like take those

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
and jump over and look at them as well.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
- That's fine, that's great.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Yeah, no, we went through a lot here

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
just during this time.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
- Yeah, for sure.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
- But there's basically, I mean, there is,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
there's an infinite number of these sorts of things

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
that you can do and different permutations

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
of various sorts.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I mean, we didn't even talk about like, you know,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
multi-indexing, which opens up literally

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
a whole new dimension of this stuff.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But it's great fun, it's pretty great fun.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
- Yeah, and a lot of the pandas 2 stuff coming on

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
changes the foundation and opens up

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
more possibilities still.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
- Absolutely.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
- All right, well, final thoughts,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
final call to action.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
What do we got here, what do you say?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
- Well, call to action, I mean,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
you can take a look at like,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I guess my overall courses and so forth

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
at learnerpython.com.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Or if you just want to improve your pandas knowledge,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
you can look at bambooweekly.com,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
the newsletter there.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
- Does it cost money or is it just a constant email?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
- So, it is a paid newsletter,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
but the first two questions and answers

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
every week are free.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
So, like, it's usually between

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
five and nine questions each week.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
But even if you don't pay,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I still want people to get some

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
pandas learning improvement practice,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
so they can totally do that.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
- Excellent.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
- Yeah.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
- All right, yeah, and check out the book, obviously.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
- Oh, yeah, that too, pandasworkout.com.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I'll hold this up here.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
- Yay.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
- It's actually pretty thick.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
- Yes, it is.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
- At the end, I was like,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
oh, that's why it took a long time.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Also procrastination, but you know.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
- Yeah, wow.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
- But I'd love to hear from people if they have,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I always love to hear, like,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
sort of interesting problems,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
data sets, issues that people are experiencing,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
just so I can sort of figure out

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
what are the next directions for me to explore

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
that I can then try to help people with as well.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
- Awesome.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Well, I appreciate all your help coming on the show,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
sharing your knowledge,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
and just riffing on pandas together.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
It was a lot of fun.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
- Excellent, my great pleasure.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
- Yeah, bye.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
All right, bye-bye
