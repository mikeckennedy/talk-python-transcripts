00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400
Hey Thomas. Hi Michael, thanks for having me here. Yeah, awesome to have you here on


00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.520
the podcast. Thanks for everyone watching live. Please put your comments out into the


00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.080
live chat and we'll see if we can make them part of the show. And with that, let's kick


00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.900
this off. Thomas, welcome to Talk Bithumbary. Yeah, thanks for inviting me, Michael. I'm


00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.060
looking forward to this conversation here today and spread astronomy and Python a little bit around.


00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.460
Two things that are so amazing. Obviously, people know that I love Python, but I really love


00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.580
maybe three angles here. I love astronomy. And I just love how it allows us to just


00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.740
dream so big, right? And so much of science fiction is about space and interplanetary travel.


00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.420
And I mean, obviously we're not there, but thinking about space is just so amazing.


00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.980
And also all of your work on YouTube is really nice.


00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.580
And we're going to talk a little bit about that.


00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.540
So super exciting topics that we got lined up here.


00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.500
Yeah, thank you very much.


00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.540
Indeed, space is really also one of my passions since I'm a child, right?


00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.100
So I worked on some stuff, still doing this as a hobby, as a side project,


00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.620
as a freelancer, and so on.


00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.300
So I think we have some topics to talk in the next 60 minutes or so.


00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.100
Yes, we do. So before we get into that, though, let's just set the stage with a little bit of


00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.460
background for yourself. And what's your story? How did you get into programming Python? And how


00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.580
do you find yourself doing all these live stream Python space science stuff on YouTube?


00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.060
Yeah, sure. So as I just said, astronomy is part of my passion since I'm a kid, right?


00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.500
But it's more about Python. And back in 2009, I started studying physics. And then I did my


00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.140
bachelor thesis in 2012 at the European Space Agency and North by in the Netherlands. And


00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.380
they had the task to create some kind of simulation software to determine the detectability of so


00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.100
called near earth objects. So objects that are, let's say, coming sometimes quite close to Earth,


00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.260
and you want to observe them, you want to detect them, you have your telescopes,


00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.380
but you don't want to waste resources, you want to see where do I have to look with what kind of


00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.980
settings. So this was my very first project and also my very first touching point or contact


00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.580
point with Python. Afterwards, I did my master thesis in GÃ¶ttingen, so in the middle of Germany,


00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.980
where I was also a student at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research.


00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.900
And there I was part for three years, a little bit more than three years on the


00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.860
field mission, so part of the Rosetta mission, which flew to the comet to remove get a cement


00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.620
goals. So maybe some of the listeners know this is a mission that we're spending on the comment


00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.780
and there was part of a small instrument called the dust impact monitor, where we use Python for


00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.260
data analytics and so on. So if you read a paper about this mission from 2000, I don't know 14 or


00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.980
so Python is involved, you can believe me that. Afterwards, PhD, I was part of the Cassini mission


00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.620
of the so-called cosmic dust analyzer. You'll see asteroids, dust, you know, the cosmos is big,


00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.940
but I was always interested in the small stuff. And there I use Python for numerical simulations


00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.660
and also machine learning. And this machine learning task is something that I'm still


00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.180
continuing because since three years I left academia, I joined the automotive industry.


00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.700
Here in Stuttgart, it's only two candidates and it's one of them is Mercedes-Benz, where I work


00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.220
as a senior machine learning engineer. But in my free time, I'm still doing this tutorial videos to


00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.500
share my knowledge I gathered over the last couple of years. And I'm doing also freelance work at the


00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.120
at the Free University of Berlin,


00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.020
continuing to develop some machine learning models


00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.820
for the Cassini mission.


00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.420
Yeah, so this is my short story.


00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.820
- What a cool story.


00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.580
I mean, you got to be on not just one,


00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.020
but two space missions,


00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.520
which is really, really fascinating.


00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.900
- Yeah, so--


00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.340
- People work on these for a long time, right?


00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.340
Like I know some of the people,


00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.820
I think it was Cassini, the people who were on the project when it was getting planned


00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.180
and then built and then oversaw that was many years, right?


00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.900
And so did you drop into it while it was kind of already going a little bit?


00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.060
Or were you there from the start?


00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.380
That's a very good question.


00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.420
That's a very good question.


00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.300
Of course, this there's always this cliche saying of saying this missions are generation


00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.780
projects and I just can confirm it.


00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.900
It's totally right.


00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.960
Like the proposal for Cassini was I think, a year or so a few years before I was born.


00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.760
And I'm now 32.


00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.400
So it is indeed a generation project.


00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.080
And I had a full head of slack hair when it started, and then I was bald when it landed.


00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.320
You know, something like that, right?


00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.880
That's a totally reasonable statement.


00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.400
Yeah, absolutely.


00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.920
I mean, these missions, they take a long time to prepare to build and test and then you


00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.400
have to fly there and get the data derive conclusions.


00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.940
And I mean, still now, Cassini is gone since like, I think five years now.


00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.200
And there's still tons and tons of data that needs to be analyzed.


00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.080
And the same thing applies also for the Rosetta mission.


00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.320
Right, right.


00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:40.560
Once the either the mission is over, because the spacecraft was destroyed on purpose, like


00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.080
Cassini was crashed into Saturn, so it wouldn't potentially end up on one of the moons that


00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.640
that could potentially have life and corrupt it, right?


00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.340
Which is a pretty,


00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.800
you have a lot of forethought or foresight there.


00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.800
Or it just, the mission is over, it returns.


00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.360
There's still, maybe the work almost just starts then, right?


00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.240
If you're trying to understand all of this data


00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.400
and trying to tease out all the things


00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.640
that might be discovered.


00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.200
- Yep, so one example, I mean, Cassini,


00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.560
when it was launched, 1997, I think,


00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.580
machine learning was not really a big topic, right?


00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.620
I mean, for example, support vector machines were invited, invented in the 90s.


00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.100
And then the last couple of years, you had no deep learning and other new methods and


00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.920
more computation power.


00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.680
And now you have more and new ways of analyzing data.


00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.860
And this was that nobody was thinking about this when the mission started, right.


00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.500
So of course, with new methods on Earth, you can analyze the data from the past.


00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.840
And this applies for many other missions as well.


00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.700
So this is amazing times.


00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.180
So if anybody's interested in astronomy and Python, I mean, you can work with heritage


00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.180
data.


00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.180
It's pretty cool.


00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.020
And a lot of that data is public, right?


00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.900
I don't know about ESA, but I know that NASA makes basically makes all of their data public.


00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.900
How about ESA?


00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.180
Yes, that's right.


00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.900
So NASA has a very good policy on this.


00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.580
ESA also, they have also their data.


00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.540
I'm not 100% sure they have like this.


00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:18.220
I think NASA has this PDS planetary data system or so where all the data are public.


00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.620
But I have to admit, I do not know the exact ESAR policy.


00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.440
So I knew that our data were public quite fast.


00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.940
So we publish everything on the PDS system with description and documentation.


00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.940
But I can only speak for my team and of the others.


00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.220
I do not know what the general policy is, though.


00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.500
Yeah, pretty interesting and fortuitous because it's the inputs for a lot of your work.


00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.340
that at least we're discussing today.


00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.220
- Absolutely.


00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.180
- Yeah.


00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.640
Question from the audience real quick.


00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.100
Kim out there asks, as a ballpark,


00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.920
how much data does a mission like Cassini generate?


00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.860
- That's a good question.


00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.900
I think there was a poster a few years back,


00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.180
I think in 2017, and it was, let's say in total,


00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.780
a large three digit gigabyte number.


00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.860
So like hundreds of gigabytes.


00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.900
Of course, one would say, "I don't care.


00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.660
There's no big data for me."


00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.860
But you have to think that this is really raw data, binary data.


00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.980
If you are decompressing the data, it's way, way more.


00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:28.720
So for example, I was working on one instrument, the Cosmic Dust Analyzer, and after decompressing


00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.420
all the data and put them into an SQL database, we had like, I don't know, like 200 gigabytes


00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.420
of data, right?


00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.220
Compressed, it was only a fraction of it.


00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:45.140
So it's really large number and especially also the images take a lot of space.


00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:51.660
The other thing you got to think about is we don't have fiber from us to the spaceships,


00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.660
right?


00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.500
It's like a 2600 baud modem.


00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.600
Not actually, but in terms of the bandwidth all the way out to Saturn, that is not a high


00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.300
bandwidth connection, right?


00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.300
Absolutely.


00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:10.260
Absolutely. I mean, if I remember correctly, the Rosetta spacecraft had like, I think,


00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:18.180
26k, like a 26k modem. So it was before my time when the internet was created, let's say,


00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:23.940
and this is, this underlines the importance of having good algorithms to compress the data and


00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:30.580
also send the data in a smart way and also to analyze the data already on board, right? So,


00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:40.540
So for example, our instrument on Phila, in fact, we would like to have all the signals,


00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.600
you know, every dimensionality and everything.


00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:48.020
But at the end, we were only able to extract certain attributes of the signals to derive


00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.460
our scientific conclusions.


00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.860
So yeah, there's always a caveat.


00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.860
Yeah.


00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.700
And well, even terrestrially, you know, on the earth, like CERN and Large Hadron Collider,


00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.780
do a bunch of processing right on those devices. Because even when you have fiber, it's still


00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.300
completely the amount of raw data blows it away. So it's got to be trimmed down to something


00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.360
like, okay, well, we'll take 1% of the interesting data and then look at that, which is still


00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.340
some tremendous number. Final question, final follow up on this, I suppose, before we move


00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:28.460
on. I saw some conversations or some write ups about the deep space network. Is that


00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:33.100
is called where they where they pass the data around and reworking that to be higher bandwidth.


00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.900
Do you do anything about this?


00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:45.340
Um, I, I did not work on any network topics. But I remember as I saw this huge dishes,


00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.980
and it's, I really can't say anything about the bandwidth, it depends on the mission, right? If


00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:57.420
you have a mission close to the sun, or at moon, you can get megabytes of data within within minutes.


00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.820
But if you compare it, for example, with the Voyager missions that are really far beyond,


00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:07.660
like it takes hours, the radio waves, it takes hours to get there and to come back.


00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.660
You're talking there about really bytes or bits per second, right? Although you have


00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:19.820
additional 80 meters, like for example, Australia or so. Improving this would probably improve the


00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:25.660
signal to noise ratio and everything to communicate better with instruments that are far away. Like


00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.000
Like also new horizons that is also now beyond Pluto.


00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.660
- Yeah, amazing.


00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.660
All right, let's make our way over towards


00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.300
the YouTube side of things.


00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.180
So I ran across you over on Mastodon


00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.500
and what an interesting time it is


00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.660
that like there's a new social network


00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.820
and people are kind of like finding a new way


00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.380
to do this thing we've done for a long time.


00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.900
So I saw your profile, like, okay,


00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:58.900
So it says, "Former space scientist, ML engineer,


00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.640
"creating Python and space and machine learning


00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.620
"tutorials on YouTube."


00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.700
I'm like, all right, I gotta go watch these.


00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.460
And so I ended up on your YouTube channel


00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.760
thinking just, you know, what a really cool project


00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.820
that you got going on there.


00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.520
And I wanted to share that with everyone,


00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.420
especially the data science folks.


00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:20.380
But even if you're just interested in, you know,


00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.700
a little bit of these data science tools,


00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.940
or I can see this being really interesting for teachers,


00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.300
maybe high school and college,


00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.020
who wants something slightly more interesting


00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.700
to show their students then,


00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.860
you know what, we're gonna load up


00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.380
the New York City taxi cab tipping data once again,


00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.060
and you're gonna like see that,


00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.160
there's really a lot of cool possibilities


00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.740
for things that are both pretty approachable,


00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.740
not tons of code, but the results are cool,


00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.980
and it's in this sort of inspiring in the sense


00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.340
that we talked about with space at the opening.


00:12:52.340 --> 00:13:00.820
Now, before we get into this, like specifically, one thing I just want to get your thoughts


00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.220
on because this is really interesting.


00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:07.780
You hear people talk about how social media is really bad and there's filter bubbles and


00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:14.900
there's misinformation and absolutely acknowledging all those things are true.


00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:20.500
Places like YouTube, they just, for all of their problems and all of their like fail


00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:26.580
videos and memes of the day, there's a whole bunch of really, really incredible information.


00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:32.420
So for example, I had Dr. Becky on and she's got an incredible YouTube channel over there,


00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.900
like half a million subscribers.


00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:41.340
You know, she does such a good job of being very real about talking about, you know, what


00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.660
she does and as an astronomer and also sharing, you know, she does stuff where she's like


00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.320
sharing notebooks on screen and whatnot, but it's still pretty informational.


00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.800
The other one that I really like is Astrum


00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.040
with Alex McCaughan.


00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.560
Just really, if you're just gonna kick back and relax


00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.040
and watch something inspiring,


00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.240
this is a fantastic channel that people can check out.


00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.240
But what caught my attention about your work


00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.240
is just it's so concrete, right?


00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.500
It has this sort of inspirational, amazing things,


00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.760
but then you're like, now let me pull up the Cassini data


00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.600
and let me throw that into Pandas.


00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.400
And then there's a bunch of cool tools we'll talk about


00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:24.000
used to visualize it. So maybe what are your thoughts on this? Like YouTube as an educational


00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.720
resource compared to say like discovery channel or history channel or these other places you think


00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.880
these are great pro documentaries, like actually, these are way crappier than these YouTube channels.


00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:39.680
It's amazing. Yeah, I think I think there are a lot of different channels out there for let's say


00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.880
different levels of knowledge, right? I mean, like what you showed other channels, they would like to


00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.880
to do something like public outreach.


00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.920
So they explain science maybe on the basic level.


00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.520
And it's pretty good and fair, right?


00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.640
Because you reach more people, you reach a larger audience and make science


00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.400
more accessible to this people, right?


00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.320
Um, this applies for a lot of different science, science channels, like


00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.280
we've also like Vsauce or so who made also science quite popular, you know,


00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.720
with his funny videos, with his funny beginnings and so on.


00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.480
And the thing I wanted to do was to introduce, let's say,


00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.520
this Python character to really work on the data.


00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.080
And I know that I will never reach the audience like the others,


00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.240
because the others, let's say, they have a different goal.


00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.720
They want to make, let's say, popular science, so to speak,


00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.120
to make it accessible.


00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.240
Here you have more requirements to understand that they have videos,


00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.480
like, for example, Python and so on.


00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.160
So this is more like really for the people who are really into coding and so on.


00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.240
But I was thinking, and I just checked YouTube, and I was thinking,


00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.240
"Well, there are coding videos out there,


00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.240
but this particular small spot, Astronomy and Python,


00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.360
it was a gap, nobody was filling it."


00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.320
And I was thinking, "Well, let's try it out and see how the response is."


00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.640
And I was writing on Reddit, on Twitter, and so on with some people.


00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.320
And you talked about high school teachers.


00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.760
Actually, some teachers were writing me and said,


00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.280
"Hey, Thomas, this is pretty cool.


00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.660
Can I use your code? And so I said, of course, everything is open source, right?


00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.160
So yeah, you reach a different audience there.


00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.240
You do not reach thousands or hundreds of thousands of people,


00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.080
but people who like to interact with you, talk with you and have ideas and so on.


00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.160
So this is this is pretty cool. And I like it.


00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.420
It's it's really amazing.


00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.140
And also, those people that you reach, many of them


00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.920
have an amplification effect, right?


00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.800
Like somebody who watch Astrum probably just really enjoys it.


00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.100
but somebody watches your video might go do a good college lecture,


00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.300
make it part of their course or, you know, sort of spread it further.


00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.600
So really, really, really cool.


00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.000
So what we're going to do is we're going to go through a couple of your videos


00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.200
and highlight some of the ideas.


00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.000
I don't know how long is your...


00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.300
You've got a playlist which I'll link to called Space Science with Python.


00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.500
It says how many videos.


00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.700
Do you know how long it is? About, roughly?


00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.300
Oh, good question. I have no over 60 videos.


00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.900
So this is like the main playlist.


00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.500
I have also a new earth objects and also machine learning.


00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:14.260
So I think in total, I would say each video is like between 10 to 25 minutes.


00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:19.780
The so in total, it's a few hours, let's say, if you're more familiar with


00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.060
Python, you can also let's say, take only a look at the Jupyter notebooks.


00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:28.060
Um, so yeah, it really depends, where you would like to start and just small


00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.260
disclaimer, my very first videos, the audio quality is not so good and I'm


00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.620
I'm really talking like a robot.


00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:42.300
So yeah, it was kind of difficult for me in the beginning, but now it's way easier, let's


00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.300
say.


00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:48.540
I can tell you the ones that I watched further down, perhaps, are really good, really nicely


00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.060
done and I can definitely recommend them.


00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.020
And as somebody who has gone on this journey of creating stuff public, if I go back and


00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.220
listen to episode one, two or three of my show, there's a bunch of great stuff there.


00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.060
I'm just like, it's still a little bit of a cringe-worthy


00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.900
type of thing, right?


00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.700
So you're like, oh my gosh, listen to the audio


00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.060
and that echo, where's that echo?


00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.340
Who didn't notice this echo, you know?


00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.040
All right, so let's, before we dive into this,


00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.460
there's a couple of tools and libraries and stuff


00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.540
that I came across that were really,


00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.860
some were new to me and some were really, really powerful.


00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.180
So you have all of your code, as you said, on GitHub,


00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.820
and we'll link to that.


00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.220
Maybe the first one, maybe it was its name,


00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.420
or you just used it a lot on some of the first videos that I watched.


00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.500
SpicyPie. I mean, what a cool name.


00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.500
So what is this? Tell us about SpicyPie.


00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:44.140
Yeah, so SpicyPie is based on a toolkit from NASA.


00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:48.820
So NASA introduced Spice, I would say, decades ago, right?


00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:53.180
It's a toolkit based on C, Fortran, I think also Java.


00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:58.580
And Spice is like, let's say, the tool to compute trajectories.


00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:04.280
So the movement, the path of planets of spacecraft and so on, but not only the


00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.040
movement, also, for example, the orientation of a spacecraft, where is my camera looking


00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.760
on Mars?


00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.120
Where, how is my instrument oriented with respect to Saturn and stuff like this?


00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:20.040
So basically every geometric question you would like to question, you can answer this


00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:20.640
with Spice.


00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:27.160
There was one caveat, though. There is no native support for Python.


00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.900
And there's one, I think he's still a PhD student, Andrew Enix,


00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.400
and he was thinking, "Well, I write, I make a wrapper


00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.980
for the C library for Python."


00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:44.700
So he is doing this, and it's like an unofficial library of Spice,


00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.700
which we call now SpicyPie, but it includes everything,


00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.280
really everything. And it's a little bit also kind of science.


00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.520
It's not easy to approach this toolkit,


00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.860
because if you look at the official NASA documentation,


00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.240
it's sometimes, by all due respect, please,


00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.520
it sometimes looks a little bit older, let's say,


00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.400
you know, like an older HTML site.


00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.360
I mean, the advantages will remain for the next decades as well, right?


00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.900
No fancy front end stuff.


00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.520
I put it in the Wayback Machine, and it looks the same.


00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.780
Something like that, right?


00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:26.020
And yeah, and I try and spicy pie is something I use also my videos and try to help others or


00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:31.780
my viewers to approach this tool to compute trajectories, the positions of planets and so on,


00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.100
because you can do all these things with spice and spicy pie is the perfect wrapper for it.


00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:41.780
Yeah, it looks really, really easy to use. And that's the kind of thing that just,


00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:50.340
it seems really unapproachable without a little bit of help. On this day, at this second,


00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:56.900
how is Jupyter oriented over to Earth? And if this comet is coming through at this angle,


00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:02.820
what's the distance between? Those kinds of questions, over time, seem really tricky to


00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.780
answer. And it's those kinds of things you can do with SpicyPy, right?


00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:13.620
Exactly, yes. There's one small caveat though, you have to know so-called kernels. So huge database


00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:19.700
with a lot of files where all the information is stored. But again, I also put it into my videos


00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:25.780
and there is some documentation on this. The learning curve is quite steep, but very,


00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:32.980
let's say, humbling in the beginning. I can imagine. Let's see. Yeah, so in a lot of your


00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:41.220
GitHub, you'll have these kernelmeta.txt and what is this here? It's just a picture. And in here,


00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:47.620
it's got a link back to these particular files that have all the information that


00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.380
SpicyPy needs, right? So it's not completely standalone. You've got to provide it these


00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:59.460
files to work from, right? Exactly. So I put these kernels that I use for my tutorials also


00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.340
also in the GitHub repository. And for example, these three kernels is like,


00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.860
the second one you see this 0012.tls,


00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.100
it's something that contains time information.


00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.860
So you may know every four years you have a leap day,


00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.460
you have to add in your calendar, right?


00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.140
But there's only half the truth.


00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.940
There are also so-called leap seconds and leap milliseconds and what's not.


00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.380
And yeah, these crucial information are stored in these files,


00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.580
for example, and you need to load them to convert time.


00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:34.780
Well, you know, we don't care that much about a leap second here and there on earth.


00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:43.260
But if you're traveling for 10 years at 30,000 miles an hour, 50,000 kilometers an hour,


00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.300
off by one second might mean you don't make it to the right place, right?


00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.700
Exactly.


00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:54.380
I mean, with SPICE, you also compute the orientation, for example, of your dishes to the spacecraft


00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.780
and pointing is very, very crucial.


00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.900
I mean, light speed is not instant, right?


00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:04.740
also takes some time. So you have to be really careful and really precise with your scientific


00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.140
work and alignment. I suppose you do. I was thinking of spaceships, but I wasn't thinking


00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:15.860
of flight. But you're right. Another question for the audience, are those kernels effectively


00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.700
enormous tables of data about where Jupyter will be at a given time and stuff like that?


00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:29.480
And they are basically, yeah, in a way they are, but they are also, yeah, they are different


00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.840
kernels with different precision.


00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:36.320
So for example, for the solar system, you have very precise kernels that cover a year,


00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.800
for example, and you have maybe less precise kernels that cover 50,000 years or so.


00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.740
So there are like really, really different kernels that cover different time ranges with


00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.760
different precisions.


00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.720
But you're basically right. And let's say the art is to create your own kernels


00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.720
with your own methods and so on.


00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.520
This is something I did not cover yet, but we will get to this in the future.


00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.520
Okay, more videos to come.


00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.400
All right, so we spoke about Spicy Pie. Excellent.


00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:09.200
Another one you want to give a shout out to was AstroML.


00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:17.240
AstroML was my first contact point with machine learning, actually.


00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.440
So they have this package called AstroML.


00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.960
And it's also, if you scroll down a little bit,


00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.360
then you will see also a book, which is called,


00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.480
it's a very long title, Data Mining.


00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.400
Oh yeah, there, Statistics Data Mining,


00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.640
Machine Learning and Astronomy.


00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.920
And it's a book that covers space or astronomy,


00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.720
Python and machine learning.


00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.760
And this is like, I like this book.


00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.360
I mean, I'm not getting paid for the advertisement or so.


00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.360
I really read through it.


00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.800
I went through the tutorials and saw on the tutorial,


00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.680
some, the notebooks are for free.


00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.920
And this is an extreme good resource


00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.840
to also get in touch with machine learning,


00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.000
Python and astronomy, and it covers a lot of topics.


00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.800
So if you have nothing to do for Christmas time,


00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.140
just take the book a few hours per day and go through it.


00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.920
- Yeah, okay, fantastic.


00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.080
And what kind of questions do you answer with AstroML?


00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.440
Like when would you use it?


00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:23.400
So AstroML has, yeah, for example, they have a lot of examples of star data and also extra


00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.460
galactical data.


00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:31.000
So for example, spectra, so-called spectra of galaxies, like a galaxy has a certain color.


00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.960
So the color is like in physics, it's like a spectrum, different wavelengths, or also


00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.280
active galaxies and so on.


00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.560
And then with AstroML, you can, for example, identify clusters.


00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.360
You can classify the galaxies into different categories.


00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.460
For example, you have also the galaxy scattered


00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.920
all over the sky.


00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.320
They're using, for example, clustering algorithms


00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.520
to identify certain structures in the night sky.


00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.020
So we have like huge so-called groups or so of galaxies.


00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.840
And of course you can make your own empirical models,


00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.880
or you can also, for example,


00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.640
use unsupervised machine learning methods


00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.640
to identify these huge clusters of galaxies.


00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.640
And these are like one or two examples


00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.440
they cover with this book.


00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.480
- Cool.


00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.200
Yeah, you can understand things like


00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.500
based on the general color of the galaxy,


00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.900
it might be a different age because the stars are older


00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.360
and the older stars burn in a different light


00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.680
than like a bright new, you know, blue star, right?


00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.940
- Correct, yes.


00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.680
- Yeah, excellent.


00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.920
And then one thing, I don't think I pulled it up


00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.740
And it's is it vis-vis with a Z or vis-vis with an S?


00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.980
- It's with an S.


00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.920
- Let's see how well.


00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.760
- Yeah, and.


00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.640
- You gotta be careful when you search live for things.


00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.480
Yeah, here we go.


00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.440
- (laughs) On the top, yes.


00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.600
- Oh yeah, it's all good.


00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.440
- Perfect.


00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.160
- So you'll see this make an appearance as well.


00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.600
And you tell us about vis-vis because it's not,


00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.240
as you pointed out, it's not particularly popular


00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.080
in terms of use.


00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.080
It's got like right now, 198 stars.


00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.000
But wow, it looks really incredible for exploring data.


00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.920
Tell us about this.


00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:22.280
- I'm still wondering why it only has 200 stars.


00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.120
So let's say, let's go into the history.


00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.680
Let's push it.


00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.720
So maybe a little bit of history, why I found this.


00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.160
What I liked at the beginning or retrospectively,


00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.200
what I liked when I started using Python,


00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.160
I had no ideas about libraries, right?


00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.640
I was completely unbiased.


00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.640
What is NumPy?


00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.640
What is pandas?


00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.640
I don't care.


00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640
I don't know.


00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.620
So I was really searching in an unbiased way for a visualization tool for 3D rendering.


00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.840
And I found this VisVis.


00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.640
At this point, it had like 30 stars or so.


00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.040
And I was like, "Ah, this looks really nice to make some animations of videos, for example,


00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.040
of asteroids."


00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.960
And I was also writing a little bit with the author and saying, "Hey, I would like to,


00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.960
I have some questions.


00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.960
Can you help me?"


00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.360
He helped me also because I was a beginner.


00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.280
And over the years, I've always used it for my animations.


00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.320
Also on my YouTube channel, you'll find two videos of the Rosetta spacecraft, like a trajectory


00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.320
and so on.


00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.540
No fancy animation, just simple and easy.


00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:22.240
And you can also use it, for example, to read in shape data of, for example, comets or asteroids,


00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:28.360
really like the 3D things, and then render them in OpenGL, play around and have a feeling.


00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.120
How does a comet look like?


00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.760
And this package supports it out of the box.


00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.400
I'm extremely impressed and I'm also, let's say,


00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.040
negatively impressed that it's still 200 stars.


00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.560
So shout out to Alma Klein and his VisVis package.


00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.960
This is something that I use now since the beginning,


00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.960
since 10 years now.


00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.080
- Yeah, it's what I saw you doing


00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.960
that was really, really cool.


00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.420
You will maybe see this in one of the videos,


00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.440
but you create a, take a 3D shape of the comet,


00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.080
a very high resolution one,


00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:08.840
lots of polygons, render that in a way that you can rotate and zoom in and explore it.


00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.600
And then on top of that, you say, well, let's plot the path of the Phileas lander that landed


00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.960
on it that you worked on and how it moved around in this like 3D space. And you can


00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:30.760
rotate it and look at the elevation. Yeah, in Python, we have such a treasure, so many choices


00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.800
of visualization libraries.


00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.100
I think that partly might be having some to do with it


00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.160
because it's just like, well, there's these 400 things


00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.060
to choose from to visualize my data, where do I start?


00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.340
So maybe people stick more to the most common ones.


00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:51.580
- Exactly, I mean, Matplotlib, I mean, it's super fair,


00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.720
right, also for scientific plotting and so on,


00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.860
but especially 3D rendering and so on,


00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.660
it's quite rare to find something impressive,


00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.860
easy to use and something that has good performance, right?


00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.560
- Right, and is interactive, yeah.


00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.300
- Absolutely. - All right.


00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:13.220
Let's start with this first video.


00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.820
I asked you to pull out a couple of videos


00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.860
that you thought were interesting.


00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.680
And the first one is the asteroid flyby.


00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.220
So maybe tell us a bit about this particular video,


00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.900
what you were trying to demonstrate.


00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.780
And I'll pull up maybe this JPL small body database


00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.040
and look at the source code a little bit too.


00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.260
- Yeah, sure.


00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.320
So some of you of the viewers or listeners


00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.860
may have some science feeds, right?


00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.420
Like you have some news, like for example, I don't know,


00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.740
killer asteroid is flying towards earth


00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.700
or something like that.


00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.540
And then you read the article and it's reported-


00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:52.340
- People had to run, it created this giant tsunami


00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.620
in Gulf of New York, yeah.


00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.260
Exactly. And then you read the article and it's put it into perspective.


00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.740
Ah, it's not dangerous at all.


00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.580
And it's like X, Y, Z kilometers or miles passes by.


00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:07.460
And well, you cannot really grasp this as a reader, right?


00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.900
What is 50 million kilometers? Is it a lot? Is it not a lot?


00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.020
You know, you don't get really a feeling.


00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.940
And I was thinking, well, let's take a particular example like this one here.


00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.940
2021 WP. What a nice name.


00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:26.220
And let's see how many miles or kilometers it has a flyby.


00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.460
And this applies not only for this object, it applies for several other objects.


00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.180
And if you know how to compute these things,


00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.260
if you know your, for example, matplotlib routines and so on,


00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.300
then you get a maybe better feeling and understanding


00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.820
that sometimes a close flyby, let's say, it's not that close.


00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:46.820
So you know that, for example, it has like, I don't know,


00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:52.660
certain distance, and then you convert it, for example, to a factor of, of the distance


00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.940
between moon and earth.


00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.860
And then it says, yeah, it's the distance 100 times between earth and moon.


00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.540
And you think like, well, in my world, that's not a close flyby.


00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:07.540
Of course, astronomical scale it is, but it's not comparable to a flyby of let's say 2000


00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.980
kilometers, right?


00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.980
So this helps a little bit to understand the data to understand what's going on there.


00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.860
And then also to visualize it and see, okay, what does it mean close flyby, right?


00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.380
So I think that's quite helpful to understand that.


00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.380
I think it is.


00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:30.260
And one of the things you did here a lot was you said, okay, well, let's, let's look at


00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.260
this.


00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.380
And when you get the answers, you would say, well, we're gonna not necessarily talk about


00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.460
it in miles, but you would divide it by one.


00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:42.300
LD was that distance to the moon?


00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.100
- Yes, a lunar distance, for example.


00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:45.940
- Yeah, lunar distance.


00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.500
- So we have like two metrics here,


00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.100
the lunar distance and the so-called sphere of influence.


00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.100
That's something else.


00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.120
It's a larger sphere, virtual sphere.


00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.360
- Yeah, so if people wanna go through this one,


00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.460
this one, I would say,


00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.260
really takes advantage of SpicyPie, right?


00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.580
You do a couple of things.


00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:06.980
You say, "We're gonna load up all the data


00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.340
about this asteroid.


00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.580
We're gonna load up the data about the Earth


00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:16.260
the moon and the sun and try to put all these things together using spicy pie, right?


00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:24.100
Yeah, exactly. So most or some people who know a little bit about physics here,


00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:30.180
they say, well, you need always this multi body simulation, you need to know the gravitational


00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:35.620
influence of the sun, the moon of Mars and Earth and so on. But sometimes and this is


00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.160
also something I show here. You can reduce it to a simple two body problem.


00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.780
You just assume that the earth has a certain gravitational influence up to a


00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:48.260
certain range, and afterwards you can neglect the influence. And then you see,


00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.760
check if the asteroid is, for example, passing or crossing the so-called


00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:58.340
sphere of influence. I think for earth is like, I don't want to lie, 600,000


00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.380
miles, respectively, a million kilometers or so. something like that.


00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:09.020
three or four. Yeah, something like this. Yeah. 2.4 or something. Yeah, it's even written there,


00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.980
right? Yeah. And this is, and then you switch, for example, between different coordinate systems


00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:18.780
and you ignore the sun and then you only consider the earth and so on. And of course, it's not as


00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:24.060
precise as an embodied simulation, but it helps to understand what is the influence of each,


00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:28.860
each individual body in the solar system. Yeah. So another thing you did on this one is you went


00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:36.780
through and said, let's figure out when this 2021 WP asteroid enters the Earth's sphere of influence


00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.820
and see how much it will be affected. How much will its trajectory be altered through there?


00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:49.260
Yes, so there are also books of astrodynamical theories where you can


00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:54.860
use some equations and yeah, for example, yeah, predict the changes a little bit.


00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.260
But here with this example, with this particular example, you get really a


00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.460
feeling and understanding how is the orbit altered, right?


00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:07.180
And of course, if it's closer to the earth, it's more severe than outside.


00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.620
Also the dwell time.


00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:12.880
So how long is the object in the sphere of influence with what kind of


00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.980
velocity inclination angle and so on.


00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.460
So it's a very multidimensional problem.


00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.140
It's not trivial.


00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.180
You really have to have a feeling, understanding and


00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.460
simulate this a little bit.


00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:27.460
And then you see how earth affects its cosmic vicinity,


00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.460
especially the smaller objects


00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.420
like the small asteroids and comets.


00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:35.220
- And just for people listening


00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.420
and not seeing this at the moment,


00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.740
the code that you wrote to figure out


00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:46.640
when will the thing enter the sphere of influence,


00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.980
given it starts way back when it was detected or whatever,


00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.900
It's only like 11 or 12 lines of code.


00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.640
It's not super complicated stuff.


00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.120
Putting together things like Panda and SpicyPy


00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.480
and some simple Python,


00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.560
and that includes two lines of reporting,


00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.800
I suppose, as well, doesn't it?


00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.840
So it's pretty approachable, I think.


00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.200
It's not obvious at first,


00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.480
because SpicyPy has weird functions you gotta call,


00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.240
but once you know, like, this is the one I need,


00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.540
then it's not hard at all.


00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.480
- Exactly, right?


00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.600
I mean, this is how everybody of us started programming


00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.480
in a way, right? We made maybe some overkill functions


00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.200
and for loops and what's or not, right?


00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.940
And after time, you get a better feeling and understanding.


00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.940
And of course, even this code, you could probably improve even more,


00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:34.320
but I try to find a balance between, let's say,


00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:39.740
yeah, length of the code and also, yeah,


00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.960
if the reader can comprehend it or not, right?


00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.880
I mean, I could put everything in one line, nobody would understand it,


00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.160
and I could say, "Well, it looks elegant."


00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.260
but I try to make it explainable.


00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.540
- Yeah, there's definitely a balance of like,


00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.540
just don't use things too fancy, just make it approachable.


00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.220
I think along these lines, there's a question from Martin.


00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.460
It says, "Is there a primer to understanding trajectories


00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.140
"of New York objects?


00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.060
"It's great to have the data, but you might be limited


00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.660
"in what you can do if you're not a subject matter expert."


00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.660
I think this video actually is not a bad start,


00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:12.820
but what would you say?


00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:17.420
- That's a very good question.


00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.100
I'm currently doing a small series on this new Earth object


00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.180
topic because, yeah, the orbital elements,


00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.860
you have to understand orbital elements,


00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.060
what are orbital elements.


00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.980
You can generate a lot of insights in there.


00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.060
But this is what I try to approach a little bit


00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:34.020
and help, right, with all the small videos.


00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.980
I think you see here, yeah, new Earth objects.


00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.020
It's still not finished.


00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:41.660
Yeah, you've got a whole playlist on 12 videos, right?


00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.580
Yeah, I think a new one will follow the next couple of days.


00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:51.180
And the thing is, so the person who asked the question is totally right.


00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.940
You have to have some kind of understanding of this, of this, of this


00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:55.480
concepts.


00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.300
I try also to make some concept videos you see on the right hand side.


00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.100
It's not related to Python at all.


00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.540
And I have to apologize.


00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.780
I'm not like a, I don't have a million subscribers.


00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.660
I'm have, don't have the animation skills to do this things.


00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.420
You're like, like good animations or so.


00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.720
I really try to make it like a lecture in the university to make it as


00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.960
understandable, approachable as possible.


00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.440
Um, but yeah, you have to dive also into the physics sometimes to


00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.180
really understand what's going on.


00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:27.200
But the good thing about especially asteroids and so on, you, the


00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.880
learning curve is also very steep.


00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.860
You get really easily into this topic.


00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.240
So just read one hour book about orbital elements or two


00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.680
hours and you can start.


00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.300
Yeah.


00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.680
And you've got a whole YouTube channel full of recommendations there.


00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.200
Awesome.


00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:42.700
Okay.


00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:50.220
So I guess to wrap this one up, you went through and you, there's a bunch of elements, orderable


00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:58.020
element properties in the JPL database that like the eccentricity and the Perry, remind


00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.020
me what Perry is.


00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:02.520
Yeah, I can explain maybe one, two values.


00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.740
So to demystify these numbers, right?


00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.300
I mean, these numbers are really complex.


00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:14.740
But for example, the eccentricity, you can say this value is between zero and one.


00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:20.080
Zero means it's a perfect circle and very close to and the more it goes to one, it's


00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.080
more and more elliptic.


00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.860
It's more and more like shaped like an egg.


00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.920
And if it's larger than one, then it will just make one run revolution around the sun


00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.500
and then it goes au revoir into the outer space.


00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:36.680
A Q for example, is the closest distance this object will have with the sun.


00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:43.160
And 0.93 means it's 93% of the distance between earth and sun.


00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.080
So this is like really just a just just just a value.


00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:53.960
It's like very, very close to 140 million kilometers or 80 million miles.


00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.920
And the inclination is also another value.


00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.800
Let's say this is the last one.


00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.680
We have the earth.


00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.940
Now imagine you have a table, you know, the table.


00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:06.000
So for the listeners, you have a table, you put a small ball in the center, that's your


00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.760
sun. And now you have a second ball rolling around the sun, that's the earth. And the plane,


00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:17.760
yeah, the table is your so-called ecliptic plane, but not every object is moving on this plane.


00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.800
Now you have sometimes objects that are a little bit inclined, maybe by a few degrees or even 80


00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:29.280
or 90 degrees. This inclination is actually called inclination I, and here it's for example,


00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:37.360
3.8 degrees. So these are the three elements you know now and it's quite, let's say, quite easy to


00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:44.080
understand on the meta level. Yeah, yeah, for sure. So when you do all of your math, you come back


00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:48.880
and say, well, let me check this back against these numbers. How close are we, you know, how


00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:55.120
close do we get to predicting what JPL said it was, right? So that's kind of a cool way to check.


00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:01.920
Yeah, I mean, there's like JPL has a data, they've also the minor planet center has some data. So


00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:07.760
they always deviate a little bit, right? If you let's say, plus minus 1%, or so or 0.1%,


00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:15.280
you can reach this with very simple Python, Python scripts. And I think that's quite fair


00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.760
results, right? I mean, you don't have the ambition to write a high, highly scientific


00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:25.520
paper. It's at the end, it's you can live with this. And you have to be careful. So you have


00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:30.080
like tons of numbers here. And it suggests the precision that's not really existing, right?


00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.720
Because the precision is limited by the uncertainty. So the uncertainty is like really the cap.


00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:41.760
And that's it. One final thing I suppose to talk about before we move off this video is


00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:48.960
you talk about describing where this is an asteroid, right? Not a comet, or no,


00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:54.000
this was a commoner asteroid, which one is it? Actually, I don't know. It could be it could be


00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.120
be one of these things. It's nobody written if it's an asteroid or comet. So most likely


00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.000
it's an asteroid, but you don't know.


00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:12.760
Yeah, okay. So it comes shooting by and you talk about, okay, well, let's use the solar


00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.080
coordinates to talk about it. And then when it gets close enough, like gets into the sphere


00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:21.360
of influence, you go, let's switch it over to the Earth-oriented, where Earth is at the


00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.800
the zero zero point coordinates and we can as it's close to us, we can talk about it


00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.860
relative to us and then it shoots back out like switch it back to the solar. Maybe talk


00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.320
real quickly about like how you think about that.


00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:38.960
Yeah, those you already explained it pretty well. I mean, this is how you can compute


00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:45.160
the change of orbits of asteroids without some heavy and body simulation, you just switch


00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.560
between coordinate systems with different centers. And Michael, you explained it perfectly.


00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.720
It is the way how you described it.


00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.400
So it's a very, let's say, simple approach,


00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.120
but you can implement it quickly


00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.360
and it's really nice to see the results.


00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.760
- And it's great to think of as a human,


00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.640
like how far is it from earth and what direction is it?


00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.860
Talking about from the sun,


00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.920
when you're trying to see how it relates to you,


00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.280
it makes less sense.


00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.520
In the math to do, it's pretty easy.


00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.000
You just subtract, you know,


00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
do vector subtraction or addition for pandas rays, right?


00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.400
>> Absolutely, yeah, you're right.


00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.400
It's basically it, yeah.


00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.200
>> Cool.


00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.000
Okay, next one here.


00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.200
A comet in 3D.


00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:31.000
And this is where you talk, where you show viz viz.


00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Let's talk about this comet.


00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.400
This is why I was confused whether it's a comet or asteroid.


00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.400
Or actually, yeah, it's a comet.


00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.400
>> It's a comet, yes.


00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.200
>> Yeah, good.


00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.000
Okay, got it.


00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:43.800
Got it right.


00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.200
So tell us about this thing.


00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.240
Tell us about this thing, this 67P, what is this?


00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.880
- So this was the main,


00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.240
or this was the scientific objective or goal


00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.840
of the Rosetta Thiele mission by ESA, right?


00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.720
So ESA was sending the probe several years ago,


00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.060
I think it was 2004, I think.


00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:09.040
And it started to a 10 year journey to this comet.


00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:12.160
And this comet is a so-called periodic comet.


00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.760
So it revolves around our sun


00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.680
And the maximum distance from the sun is somewhere around Jupyter.


00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.140
Yeah.


00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.960
So it's not like the heli comet, for example, that comes back every 90 or a


00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.460
hundred years, it's like a regular visitor, but a very small one.


00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.720
And he's, I was thinking, well, it's a perfect goal.


00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.000
Let's go there and see how this thing, how this thing looks like.


00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.840
And so they were sending the Rosetta spacecraft there.


00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:42.120
And, this became closer and closer in 2014 until the Rosetta spacecraft


00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.920
reached its final orbit, was deploying the lander, everybody was happy.


00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:52.500
But in the meantime, the spacecraft made more and more and more images of this comet from


00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.600
different angles.


00:44:53.600 --> 00:45:00.300
So like a huge stereoscopic camera, you make, you can derive 3D information.


00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:05.960
And this 3D information is then going through some algorithms I'm not familiar with.


00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.880
And then at the end, you get this shape model, as you said, in the beginning of the podcast,


00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.400
this polygon shape.


00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.120
And this polygon shape is free data, it's freely accessible,


00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:21.280
and I just downloaded it, and yeah, you do some data crunching,


00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.560
and then I used VisVis to visualize it.


00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:28.280
And then you can see really the different structures,


00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.480
how this two-ball shape looks like.


00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.760
Some people describe it as a rubber duck


00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.360
with a small head and a larger body.


00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.840
And you will also see in this 3D that there is like a night sight


00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.360
that's always in the night, so you don't know how it looks like.


00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.400
It's very, the 3D model is very smooth because you don't have any information there.


00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:53.960
So it's pretty impressive to see how this model has been derived with data from,


00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.640
yeah, millions of miles away.


00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:01.000
And now you can really reconstruct the comet on your small laptop.


00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.640
Yeah, the one that you reconstructed with Python looks not, not the level of detail


00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.720
of maybe some of the very highest resolution pictures here,


00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.120
but it looks pretty believable


00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.320
that those are the same things, which is quite amazing.


00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:19.160
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:19.980
- Now, you said this was small.


00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.880
- Of course, the images are way better.


00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.600
- Yeah, yeah, of course.


00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:27.640
You said it's small, and it is small,


00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:32.280
but it's approximately four kilometers square,


00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.080
or 2.5 kilometers square,


00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.160
which is not, it's not just a little pebble in space. It's a


00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.480
kind of a thing, right? It's, it's somewhat big.


00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:48.640
Yeah, it's, let's say, if this object would hit or fly towards


00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.440
Earth, we would have a problem, let's say, right?


00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.080
Really wouldn't make a movie about that one. Yeah.


00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:58.880
Oh, yeah, that's a, I don't know, some heroes can go


00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.800
there and and crush crush the comet. But if you, for example,


00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:12.400
But if you compare, for example, Shuril of Gerasimenko with other comets, like the Halley


00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.240
comet, it's a, it's a, let's say it has larger cousins out there, which are also brighter


00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.480
and you see them also in the night sky when they have, they pass by.


00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.900
And this comet, you really do not see in the night sky from earth.


00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:29.960
So this is what I'd say, I would say is small because I cannot really see it with the naked


00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.960
eye.


00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.060
It's still small in terms of planets and stuff,


00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.560
but it's not entirely small compared to say, I don't know.


00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.300
>> Yeah.


00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.540
>> If it were to hit us, we would notice.


00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.380
Let me pull up a little bit of this picture.


00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:47.540
The first thing I think is interesting in this video,


00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:52.820
which is Space Science with Python Part 22, Comet in 3D.


00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:57.620
You said a lot of stuff you're doing directly


00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:02.140
in Visual Studio Code using the notebook format,


00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.580
which is pretty interesting.


00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.620
This one you switched over to Jupyter


00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:09.980
and you started using Qt, right?


00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:14.980
Qt, PyQt, which to bring up this interactive window,


00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.180
which you create a little window and show it


00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:22.120
and pair that with VisVis, which maybe,


00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.020
and where's that fit into your world?


00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.640
Like a lot of people I think kind of just stick


00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.840
with notebooks and output, whatever they can get


00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.760
into the interactive widget inside the notebook.


00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:37.640
- Yeah, so I really like VS Code, right?


00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.700
I mean, one of the main features I use,


00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.040
especially also at work,


00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.040
is something called remote containers.


00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.400
So you have a Docker container


00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.480
with your entire working environment,


00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.800
and you can share it with people on Windows, Mac,


00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.200
Linux, really doesn't matter, right?


00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.280
This is pretty, it's game changer, right?


00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.800
But with PyQt, I was somehow not able to create this interactive widget


00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.120
out of the Docker container.


00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:06.560
So I was really playing around and trying these things out,


00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.960
but at the end I was saying, "You know what?


00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:12.600
It's fine. Let's use a simple virtual environment.


00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:16.160
Let's keep it running on the native JupyterLab environment,


00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.520
and it's fine."


00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.320
So this is where I was saying,


00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.520
"I cannot do everything."


00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.520
This was really my nemesis.


00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.980
- I don't think I'd be able to get that going either.


00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.720
So you pull this thing up and it,


00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.740
you know, initially it doesn't have any shading or anything,


00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:39.080
but it looks quite like what you would expect there.


00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.840
I'll let me, and eventually get it going


00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.160
with like shadows and light sources.


00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.880
It's a pretty cool achievement.


00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.040
And this is all that VisVis library, right?


00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:57.520
Exactly. Yes. So this was is doing is it is doing it? Yeah. And it also was part of our


00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:03.280
science paper you see now here. So for the podcast listeners, there's a paper at astronomy


00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:09.120
and astrophysics. And it was about the landing of the of the instrument also with our best


00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:14.800
instrument. And yeah, the analysis you see here also here figure four was done with matplotlib.


00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:19.840
So Python and space is not only like filling YouTube videos and making tutorials. It's really


00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:25.840
used in science. So I know also a lot of other people using Python now and you see it every day.


00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:36.080
How cool. Same tools we all have, right? All right. Let's see. This is,


00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:43.760
I think that's the same one. Then the next video, you know, this one, I could tell this really was


00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:49.440
a personal, like this meant a lot to you when you put it out into the world. The filet is


00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.040
landing because this is what one of the projects you were directly involved in, right?


00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:59.520
Yes, exactly. So I was part of the so called dust impact monitor. It was,


00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:05.840
you can imagine it's a small cube like a Rubik's cube. And it was detecting dust particles or the


00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.640
task was to detect past dust particles with something you know from your e guitars. Yeah,


00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:16.000
so something called piezo crystals. Yeah, you're you're playing your guitar, the vibrations go


00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.320
into some kind of crystal and the crystal is translating the vibration into an electric signal.


00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:26.160
And we use the same principle here to convert impacts of dust particles on our instrument


00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:30.800
to learn something about their properties like velocity, size, and shape, and so on.


00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:37.440
And this was the paper you also saw just one second ago. And we were, our instrument was on


00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:42.000
during the landing process, where we also, yeah, catch some data.


00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:50.560
Yeah, amazing. And one of the pictures you got here in this video is of that's Rosetta, right?


00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:57.920
The lander? Or no, this is Phileas, the thing that was sent down. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And it's


00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:03.440
really high res picture, I guess, taken from Rosetta. And it's, you can see it on this rocky


00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.800
cliff. It eventually found its way into this little crack where it's kind of, it's kind of


00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:12.240
stuck there, right? But what science did you get out of it before it got stuck in that crack and


00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.640
and lost its solar power?


00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.000
- That's a good question.


00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.520
So a lot of different instruments were involved, right?


00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.660
So I can say for our instrument,


00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:23.720
we had like this dust impact monitor


00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.120
and during the descent phase, we had one impact.


00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.080
So we detected exactly one particle.


00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.380
It's not a lot, I know instrument was not big,


00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.920
but at least we detected something


00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.160
because we wanted to have main science work


00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.760
on the core surface.


00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.840
Now, since we landed in this cave or cavity


00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:45.680
or what's not, we detect, we were not able to detect anything, right?


00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.600
We were a lot of power was low.


00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:52.320
So also other instruments were running there, like instruments to generate,


00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:57.920
to create, get out some samples to, measure also a little bit, the gas


00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:05.040
environment and so on to extract hopefully some organic, organic material and so


00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:05.240
on.


00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.240
So every instrument was running.


00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:13.520
also a small hammer was hammering on the surface to see how hard is the surface and it was


00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:19.640
really hard. So yeah, Fido was running for a few days, I think until the battery eventually


00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:25.400
ran out and you see it was stuck in this shadow. So the battery was not able to recharge and


00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.400
this was the end of the mission.


00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.480
That's a little too bad that it got in the shadow, but still really cool. People might


00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:38.560
not think there's going to be very much gas to detect. But like a lot of comets, it was


00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:42.360
when it got close to the sun, it was shooting a bunch of gas out of it, right? So it didn't


00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:47.600
have an atmosphere at four kilometers, but it did have gas coming off of it.


00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:53.720
Yeah, exactly. You're perfectly right. So gas and dust and a lot of activity was going


00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:58.520
on. So of course, as a human, you couldn't breathe this stuff, right? It's very, very


00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:05.260
It's not the high density, but yeah, there was a lot of stuff going on and you can really


00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.500
measure it and you can detect it.


00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:12.480
And I think also Rosetta, if I'm not mistaken, was also sometimes hit by some dust particles


00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.240
and you see them also in the camera system later.


00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:19.300
So there is a lot of activity going on there on this tiny world.


00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:24.700
And it's amazing to see that we were able to get there and measure it and see it in


00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.700
real time.


00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:26.700
This is really, really cool.


00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:27.940
- That's really cool.


00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:29.300
- It's really amazing.


00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.460
Let me see if I can pull up your picture here at the end.


00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.560
This perhaps.


00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.380
Yeah, so if you go toward for this particular video,


00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:43.020
if you go into the one thing I just want to give you credit


00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:45.980
for, I do this with my YouTube videos as well,


00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:46.820
not the podcast,


00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.180
but the ones that are specifically made for YouTube.


00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.100
It's putting chapters in,


00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:51.580
it's really nice to have chapters like, okay,


00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.220
this is the section that I, you know,


00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.820
this two minute segment is really nice.


00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.260
Like here's where you're computing this thing


00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.780
or you're rendering that thing and it's nice.


00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:03.780
So if you go over to the Rebounces task section,


00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:06.580
you can see a really cool little animation


00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:10.720
of you putting that together, drawing the line.


00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.100
Maybe tell us about this.


00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:15.660
This goes back to VisVis being pretty neat as well.


00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:19.900
- Yeah, so this was the information.


00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:24.060
So Phila was supposed to land on some area and stay there,


00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:27.180
but eventually, unfortunately, it was rebouncing,


00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.140
so for a few couple of times,


00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.460
I don't know how many times, two, three times.


00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:33.720
We can use now my video to check it.


00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.840
And well, the data is quite precise.


00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.440
So we have a very precise shape model


00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.160
and we have a very precise reconstruction


00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.020
of the trajectory of the lander.


00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:48.180
So the path, I feel it was taking.


00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.720
And yeah, and I was just taking


00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.660
this totally different sources of data sources


00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:56.180
and merging them together in VisWis,


00:55:56.180 --> 00:56:00.700
yeah, using this PyQt framework that's under the hood.


00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.060
And you see it fitted perfectly.


00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.180
The trajectory really is on the surface,


00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.340
you know, bouncing there.


00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.980
And then you see at the end,


00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:10.620
the bottom right now, so for all the listeners now,


00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:12.700
there's like the end of the trajectory


00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:15.460
in the small shadow hills.


00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.740
- Or it got into that cavern, went to the cavern, yeah.


00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:20.700
Went to rest, the big sleep.


00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:23.500
- Exactly, yes.


00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.780
- I guess what surprised me about this


00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:28.920
is just how precisely this 3D model that was made


00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:33.920
of the stereoscopic image data


00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:38.760
and then the reconstruction of the lander in this 3D space,


00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:41.220
like it lines up perfectly, like you said,


00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.080
even as you rotate it in three dimensions,


00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.140
you're like, I look at it from this angle,


00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:47.040
it's like, wow, that really is pretty accurate.


00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.580
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:51.660
I'm also always impressed how,


00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:55.760
I mean, in the science community, and also in industry, right, everybody's playing a


00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.000
small part, right?


00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.240
But you play a part and at the end to see the end product, it's like, it's amazing,


00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.240
right?


00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.160
I mean, in science, it's like, it's like this, right?


00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.860
It's like, wow, cool, we were able to generate the data.


00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.080
I mean, I have the same feeling also in industry, right?


00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.560
It's like, oh my god, look at the product at the end, you know, you're just you did


00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.300
this very small part, but it's, it's your part of it.


00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:22.140
And it's always nice to see how this mosaic puzzle is getting together at the end, right?


00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:24.060
And providing useful insights.


00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.060
It's pretty unbelievable.


00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.060
Yeah, it really is.


00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.060
All right, let's see.


00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:32.060
What else I want to say about it?


00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:34.060
I guess we're getting kind of short on time here.


00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:45.220
Let's talk about this AI112, the autoencoder latent space visualization one.


00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.820
So this is more close to your current work, right?


00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:52.820
This ML work with space science, right?


00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:57.880
- Yeah, yeah, I can explain a little bit here.


00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:02.220
So what I used in this series


00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:05.220
was so-called reflectance spectra of asteroids.


00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:07.140
So imagine you have a flashlight


00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:10.780
and you flash the asteroid,


00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:13.100
you get a reflectance of the asteroid,


00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.320
of course not a mirror or something,


00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:18.840
you get something back. And based on the difference of your flashlight and what you get back,


00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:23.840
you can derive conclusions about the chemical composition of the asteroid. So they are like


00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:30.520
different spectra that encode different types. And I use the spectra and the spectra are


00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:35.520
classified in certain classes, like some are let's say carbon rich, some are let's say


00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.320
say, Stoney, or Iron Ridge.


00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:47.040
And I was thinking, well, we can use autoencoders to check the latent space and see if we can


00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.440
see these different classes into a low dimensional space.


00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:55.120
So for all the viewers and listeners who don't know this autoencoder, it is like you have


00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:59.200
your data and you make a regression model on your data itself.


00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:03.480
Like, for example, a dog maps to a dog, a cat to a cat.


00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:08.640
And in between in your neural network, you have like only a few attributes, only a few


00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.680
numbers.


00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:16.000
And these numbers, they are like an, like a, like a encoded representation of your information,


00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.560
like the information of a cat or a dog.


00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.960
The same thing you can do also with spectra of the asteroid.


00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:27.240
And of course, I made a compression of let's say some spectra with 500 data points to two


00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.240
dimensions.


00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.840
This is severe information loss.


00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:35.540
But I did it here, not for a science paper, but more for visualization representation.


00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:40.940
And I was able then to see to show that these different classes that were that are human


00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:48.300
made, they are also underlined by a data scientific approach, right, this autoencoder and this


00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:53.940
autoencoder does not know what is an S class asteroid, what a C class, it simply sees that


00:59:53.940 --> 01:00:00.180
the spectra. And then with the different clusters, you see, okay, there is like,


01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:06.500
intrinsic different information in the spectra, right? So this is pretty cool. And to see,


01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:12.100
you can improve autoencoders with variational autoencoder and so on. But this was the,


01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:17.540
let's say, very first approach I wanted to show to anybody who's interested in this topic.


01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:26.020
Maybe this opens the box just a little bit for people who want to go back and work with


01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:32.340
some of that legacy data or historical data where people maybe tried to figure out these


01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:35.380
things just handed off to grad students.


01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.980
Say, "Yeah, how bright do you think this is?


01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.500
Is it more like that or more like this?"


01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:43.860
And then now you can apply these incredible machine learning models to it and maybe pull


01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.980
out more nuanced details or find something new.


01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.080
Yeah, exactly.


01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.340
So for example, we have also the data from the Cassini spacecraft from the Saturn mission,


01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:58.120
and we have like 100,000 of spectra there.


01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.740
And I'm doing currently some, yeah, my freelance science job, some kind of classification task.


01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:07.900
But at some point when we are finished with the project, I would like to make also this,


01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:13.680
let's say, high, highly derived data also open available to anybody, right?


01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:17.080
and show, "Hey guys, this are the spectra."


01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.920
Use other methods to classify, to cluster the spectra


01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.040
because there are tons of ideas


01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.540
and I don't have all the time, right?


01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:28.760
So I want others to be enabled to work


01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.160
and continue on this heritage data


01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:33.480
because it's not boring just because it's old.


01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.240
- Yeah, yeah.


01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.760
Now there's a lot of possibilities, I think,


01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.600
to start applying those things.


01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.080
- Yeah.


01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.860
Thomas, I think we might be out of time


01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.080
to go over any more of the videos.


01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.140
You have many, many more.


01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.600
I definitely want to encourage people


01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.320
to go check out your channel and go through it


01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.340
if they're really interested in actually diving


01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:58.960
into some interesting,


01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.840
but pretty approachable science topics.


01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.520
You've got all the code there on GitHub.


01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.480
You walk through it without taking too many shortcuts.


01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.040
And oh, look, I changed it.


01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.240
Now it totally looks great.


01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.920
You have no idea what I did, right?


01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.960
It's pretty much you can follow along well there.


01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.720
So people should check that out.


01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.820
Obviously, links in the show notes, right?


01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:21.280
- Yeah.


01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.880
Thank you very much, Michael, for inviting me


01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.440
and to anybody.


01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.600
If you have any questions or would like to know more stuff,


01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.800
just approach me, just message me.


01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.700
I'm always open for ideas and feedback


01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:33.680
and I'm glad to help.


01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.940
So just reach out to me.


01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.780
- Yeah, absolutely.


01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:37.600
But you don't get out here


01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.520
before I ask you the final two questions.


01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.520
If you're gonna write some code,


01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.720
I think I know your answer from what you've said already,


01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.720
but what editor are you using these days?


01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.360
Well, I'm using for my daily job, VS Code, of course.


01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.160
It's very nice. It's with remote containers.


01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.600
It's a game changer. You can even develop Spark locally in a container,


01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.800
which is like really amazing, right?


01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:03.680
I have to say, though, and I say this is a perfect time now


01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:06.080
to say goodbye to Atom.


01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:09.360
Atom was a very nice editor. I used it also for years.


01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.360
Now it's time to say goodbye to Atom.


01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.300
And yeah, this is something I think we should address


01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.280
here in the podcast now.


01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.560
- Yeah, well, I feel like VS Code is a little bit


01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.280
like the next, the successor to Atom, right?


01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:28.520
Atom came from GitHub, Microsoft bought GitHub,


01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.120
they released Visual Studio Code.


01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.040
They're both in a similar style of an editor.


01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.080
They're both, I think, electron apps.


01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.080
It feels like, it's not so much as a goodbye


01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.020
is like a here's the next generation.


01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.220
- Yeah, exactly.


01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.640
It's a very good successor.


01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.620
So of course you're right.


01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.680
It's a good times ahead, I think,


01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.600
with more and more plugins.


01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.440
- Yeah, cool.


01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.080
I'm sure the VS Code people will send me a message


01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.400
like that was not accurate enough,


01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.920
but no, conceptually, I think there was a lot of motivation


01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.260
that VS Code probably took from Adam.


01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.600
All right, and then we've given a shout out


01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.060
to a couple of libraries like VisVis.


01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:14.780
What, what library or tool or whatever you come across there like, oh, this is really


01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:15.780
cool.


01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:19.900
I want to tell people about you know, what, what thing you want to give a shout out to?


01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.460
I would like to give a shout out to AstroPy.


01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:28.100
And there's also a very huge Python library that contains astronomy information, you can


01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:33.420
extract data from the from astronomy databases, and so on, apply methods and so on.


01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:38.640
It is like, let's say, it's not like spice, but let's say it's, it's also quite complex.


01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.160
So you have to dive into this, right.


01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.020
But they're also open for contributions and so on.


01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:50.780
So if you are interested in joining astronomy, science data, try out Astro Pi and see if


01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:56.820
you can improve it even because this is a huge community and everybody's grateful for


01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.460
ideas and contributions.


01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.820
So a very mighty library in the astronomy community.


01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:07.140
Yeah, absolutely. All right, Thomas, thank you for being here. Final call to action people


01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:12.540
are interested in this, you know, what do you tell them how to get started?


01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:18.500
Well, yeah, just sounds like a cliche. Just be curious, right? But yeah, I mean,


01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:22.380
astronomy is not only also about Python and so on. If you just if you want to approach


01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:28.980
it differently start also with public outreach, with more public outreach related YouTube


01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:33.700
channels also, also getting a telescope or something, really do hands on stuff.


01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:34.740
It's also quite nice.


01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.960
And no, don't sit all the time in front of your computer.


01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.820
Just grab binoculars, just grab a camera and so on and do your own stuff.


01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.740
There's a lot of things.


01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:45.700
Remote telescopes are out there for a few bucks a night where


01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:46.900
you can do your own images.


01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.720
So yeah, it's not only about, it's just about Python.


01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.900
I love Python, sure.


01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:56.940
But also would like to tell you guys to approach astronomy from different angles.


01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:01.620
also sometimes going out, observe meteors, count them with your hands,


01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:04.420
and you can submit this to some organization,


01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.860
and everybody's grateful for that.


01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.380
Oh, excellent.


01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:11.340
Well, we're all grateful for your YouTube work and putting that out there,


01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:15.220
so thanks for all your contributions.


01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.900
Thanks, Michael, for having me.


01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:17.900
All right, bye.


01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:27.900
