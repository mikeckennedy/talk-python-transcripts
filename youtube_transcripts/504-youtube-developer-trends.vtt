WEBVTT

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.580
Hello, everyone. Ines, Gina, Richard, and Calvin. Welcome back to the show, all of you.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.360
It's great to have you all here.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.860
Yay. Yay. Hi.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:25.600
Yeah, really, really good to have you all here. It's been fun to have you all on separately for different shows. Although, Gina, you've definitely been on a few panel shows before recently on, I think the last movie was our Mastodon one, right? We talked about that.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:25.720
Yeah.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.020
That was a

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.300
lot of fun.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.780
Today, we're going to talk about developer trends in a general sense.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.340
And I invited you all because I, like all of you, really appreciate having you here.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.860
And thanks for taking the time to be here.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.600
But you all also kind of work in little bits of different spaces of technology and interests and so on.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.860
So I think we'll get a really nice, diverse perspective of experiences and so on.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.080
I think the AI section is going to be especially interesting, as we'll see.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.280
Where are we going with that?

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.140
That's always interesting.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.880
So what we're going to do is we're going to use the 2024 Stack Overflow developer survey results.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.380
It's a little bit old, but it's less than a year old.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.900
I think it's close enough to use as a skeleton to kind of make that conversation happen.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.780
So it's going to be a ton of fun to just have a wide-ranging exploration of how people are learning technology, using technology.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:36.240
which ones are you using, so on. Before that, though, let's just do a quick round of introductions, and we'll go around the Brady Bunch squares in order, I suppose. So, Ines, you're on top left.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.240
Welcome. Great to see you.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.820
Yeah, nice to be back. Yeah, I'm Ines. I'm the co-founder of Explosion.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:02:11.300
We're probably most well-known for spaCy, which is an open source library for natural language processing in Python. So everything to do with text, AI, I do a lot in the open source space, and also helping developers build their own AI models in-house, taking back control, that sort of stuff. So yeah, very, very curious. Like it was quite hard not to look at the results beforehand, but I did it.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:24.000
Thank you. Yeah. And we recently talked about open source and LLMs and AI and stuff and will open source or the big cloud companies dominate that. That was a lot of fun to talk about.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.520
Yeah, the AI revolution won't be monopolized.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.760
Yes, exactly. That

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.140
was great.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.980
Gina, hello, welcome.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:45.500
Hi, yeah, my name is Gina. I'm also known as Fuzel and my claim to fame is probably Octoprint, which is the snappy web interface for your 3D printer, which is actually written in Python, which in turn is probably why I am here.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:58.820
Yeah, and I also happen to be a full-time maintainer working on that project and have been doing that now for well over 12 years. So, yeah, it's a weird life, but it works somehow.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:12.300
It's got an amazing life. I mean, I'm sure a lot of people are seeing that as the dream, right? You created an open source project and it's successful enough that you can do that full-time. That's I mean,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:20.540
the people who are now listening to this instead of watching that will not see it when I point to my head, though, and show all the gray hair that is up on there.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.200
That wasn't there when I started this.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.500
So just pointing that out.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.220
There are

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.620
downsides

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.960
to this.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.740
Just correlation.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.320
Not necessarily the same, right?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.840
It's got things up.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.420
I'm sure.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.160
Yeah,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.120
I know where that goes.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.880
Hey,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.080
Richard.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.880
Good to see you.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.060
Good to see you, too, friend.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.460
Richard Campbell.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.460
I make the podcast.NET Rocks, Run As Radio, and now part of Windows Weekly as well.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.500
I'm supposed to be a half-ready.NET person, but as GitHub loves to remind me, write entirely too much Python.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.720
And

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.220
YAML.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.980
Why do I write so much YAML?

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.580
I don't know.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.400
Anyway.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.940
What kind of life choices have

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.240
you made?

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.060
I don't.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.700
You know what?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.500
I munge a lot of data these days.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.180
I don't know if

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.860
you know this, but Python's pretty good at that.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.400
My Jupyter Notebooks

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.000
open most of the time.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.000
Because there's

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.100
always some chunk of data I need to rip through.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.380
There's some surprisingly good tools.

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.480
I was just talking with Reuben Lerner about Panda stuff.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.040
What you can do in a couple lines of code is ridiculous.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.040
MapReduce used to be

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.580
this huge task where I harnessed multiple machines to try and actually crush a large amount of data in a reasonable length of time.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.520
A contemporary PC is

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.360
really good

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.880
at it.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.260
Stuff has changed.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.000
It's only getting easier.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.260
use the tools du jour and you'll find you'll get good results in less time.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.280
Absolutely.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.580
You have a bunch of great podcasts. People are so interesting too.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.980
Whenever I

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.080
get to talk to you it's usually one of the geek outs.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.700
That's where you end up.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.020
Yeah. We've done some great geek outs.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.080
Some life in the solar system and energy talks and so

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.180
on.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:08.700
The nuclear power topic these days has been really huge because everybody's talking about it and it turns out I did a bunch of stuff on that back before it was cool, and

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.380
so people keep

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.160
asking me to do more.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.020
Yeah, that's very, very neat.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.220
Calvin, hello, hello.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.740
Good to see you.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.120
Good to see you, too, Michael.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.620
I'm Calvin Hendrix-Parker.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.960
I'm CTO and co-founder of Six Feet Up, where we are a Python and AI for Good organization.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.660
Lifelong Pythonista.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.960
I chose Python back in the year 2000 and decided I never wanted to look back, and so I made a company around building cool Python stuff for other folks.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.000
So I guess that's kind of my claim to fame.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.420
This year will be my 21st PyCon, so my PyCon attendance can now drink.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.020
Oh, and boy, let me tell you, if you've ever hung out with Calvin at PyCon,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.200
you didn't.

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:56.280
Well, I would just say, we always have the best parties together, and some of the highlights are all the get-togethers that we do.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.580
That's what I'm getting at here.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.560
Yeah, getting the people together.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.500
That's what's important.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.060
Yeah, you

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.900
should all come to Europe.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.620
PyCon DE is later this month.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.300
I'm very excited.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.180
It's going to

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.800
be cooler than ever.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.540
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.900
Oh, and

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.560
you're a person as well.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.080
But I

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.380
think the PyCon,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.920
and PyCon Italy is also very good.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.160
PyData, Amsterdam, like, I don't want to single out too many individual conferences, but like you should totally

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.040
come to Germany.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.440
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.380
Sounds

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.940
like events

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.560
you need to bring your stunt liver to, though.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:38.060
Yeah, Calvin, I definitely think you definitely have been hosting some of the great parties, the after parties and stuff at PyCon.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.500
I love the community.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.120
That's probably why I'm here is because I'm definitely a community first type person.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.860
Yeah, beautiful.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.640
All right, well, with that, let's just go ahead and jump right in to the topics here.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:01.880
So like I said, what we're going to do is we're going to go through the Stack Overflow survey and just kind of use it as something to riff off of.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.900
So the first portion of Stack Overflow, of course, I'll put the link in the show notes.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.000
You can check it out and follow along.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.200
It had 65,000 people participate.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.300
That's a lot of people.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.280
I don't feel like Stack Overflow almost could have gotten more, but that's still statistically pretty significant.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:27.140
And Stack Overflow, I think it's pretty broad across all the technologies these days.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.300
Although I think Python is still the number one language on Stack Overflow.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.040
If we were to check out

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.720
Stack Overflow.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.480
Yeah, Stack Overflow trends.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.780
If we look at...

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.660
I mean, some might argue that's because Python is the number one language for developers.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:59.420
Well, I'm just saying that I think the results will be pretty significant, include a significant amount of Python feedback, not just overall, for better and worse.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:17.960
Yeah, so right now, if you look at it, we've got Python at the number one, and we've got JS's number two. But boy, oh boy, there's a really precipitous drop in 2023, and we'll come back to that. That's going to be super interesting. But that's section three of our conversation right there.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.960
So the first thing that comes up here is education.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.400
How much education have you had as a person who works here?

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.539
And then I think maybe it's probably most relevant to focus in on the professional developers.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.900
They break out all respondents versus students versus professionals and so on.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.840
So let's maybe let's do a quick around here.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.480
How much programming did you all learn in school versus how much did you teach yourself?

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.680
none none okay yeah tell us about it i mean i didn't i didn't

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.640
go into yeah computer science no

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.780
what did you study communication

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.760
science media science and linguistics

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.380
because you know

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:25.560
when i was like trying to decide what to do for university i it was weird because i didn't really feel like a programmer i was always programming on the side but like you know i thought of programmers and it was like boys from the computer club there was no one really you know also being being like being a young woman like there was not really any role model or like idea like hey i'm actually a programmer too so

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:35.100
um yeah absolutely yeah we talked about how your linguistics experience brought you into nlp stuff which got you into programming right yeah i mean i did a tiny bit i did

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:41.720
a tiny bit of pearl in university but like i'm not really counting that and also like everything we were doing that I kind of already knew from,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.420
I

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.560
don't know, just hanging around myself.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.380
Sure. Who else? Who else wants to share?

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.940
I think everyone

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.980
majored in here. Like I was computer graphics technology. I took

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.340
an

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.540
engineering course in C, an engineering course in Fortran, but I wouldn't call that a

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:05.300
computer science background. No. Interesting, but not a computer science background. Gina?

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.360
I actually have what is now a master's degree equivalent in computer science.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:18.200
For me, I also grew up programming and figuring that that was the most amazing thing ever.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.960
And then I learned that it was an actual job.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.260
And that was when I knew what I wanted to become.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:31.120
But to this day, I say I didn't learn much programming or anything like that at university.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.320
I learned tolerance towards frustration and stress management.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.120
but all of the programming stuff is actually mostly self-taught I would say

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.580
because also

00:10:42.580 --> 00:11:10.060
I mean yeah we did some assembler stuff and some really weird old stuff at university also some java which later became my main job for but before I before I went into the whole maintainer with python situation but yeah I think it's it's it's more been a case of lifelong self-teaching and and trying to stay up with things that are happening and learning new languages here and there and such.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.220
Yeah. It's not like engineering or something where it's kind of stable.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.520
You know, bridges are still bridges.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.680
Stuff is changing fast. You got to stay on top of it.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.300
That's really interesting.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.380
What's

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.300
your background, actually?

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.080
Oh, Michael.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.120
Yeah, well, I

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.820
am pretty close to where you are, Ines, as well.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.920
I was in school for a long time.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:39.040
I love school, but I studied math and chemistry, mostly math.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:47.620
And I only did just enough programming to do the research projects I was on, which was very, very little until the very end.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.300
And then I'm like, you know what?

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.360
I kind of like this better.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.080
What am I going to do to keep doing this?

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.200
Because it seems like the job opportunities are way better and it's much more interesting.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.900
So, yeah, I'm definitely on the self-taught train.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.460
Yeah, that's me.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.640
But it's really my father.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.300
He was an electrical engineer and designed electronic cash registers.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.460
So I started programming cash registers when I was eight.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.980
The original point

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.260
of sale.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:14.720
Amazing.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.160
Yeah,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.160
from the very beginning.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.880
And then

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.500
when the

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:23.960
TRS-80 Model 1 shipped in 1977, I was in the radio shack for the next year.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.680
Because that was the only thing I was interested in.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.880
A whole 4K of RAM.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.460
Amazing.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.260
Yeah.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:38.980
So my first part-time job after school was repairing TRS-80s for a company called HNS Microsystems.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.980
I've never done anything else.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.120
So

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.720
by the time I graduated high school, I did my last two years of high school living on my own, making a living as a programmer.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.160
So I didn't go to university.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.680
I was too busy working.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.060
Well, I think it paid off for you.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:55.880
I think it turned out all right.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.520
Yeah, it did okay.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.360
It did okay.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.160
I have the advantage of being first.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:03.460
Yeah, exactly.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.200
That's amazing.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:09.700
I remember reading the specifications of the IBM BC before it was released and going, 640K of RAM?

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.200
Who's going to need that?

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:12.740
That's

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.840
way more than you're ever going to need.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:14.680
All right.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.960
So what does Stack Overflow say?

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:27.920
It says that about 75% of the people have a bachelor's or a master's degree, but only a little under – where is that number again?

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:28.200
School.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:38.020
A little under 50%, just under 50% of the people actually are using school to become software developers.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:52.500
Then, you know, how we, so pretty much all of us here are in some way or other having to keep up with this technology and libraries and so on our own.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.920
And so the next one asks, like, what online resources are you using?

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.940
So maybe we can go around real quick.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.780
Where are you all spending your time?

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.640
I'll start first.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.640
Probably YouTube for me with other blogs and other things thrown in.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.180
But YouTube is a big portion where I learn new things and keep up with stuff.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.080
I'm a reader.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.920
It's the fastest mechanism for me.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:28.300
I prefer to read my documentation at the pace that I can read it at and then test stuff out.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.280
You know, I like YouTube.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.480
It's just too slow.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:32.700
Yeah.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.080
See,

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.760
I'm a slow reader.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:42.800
It's funny you say that, because I was also like, my problem with YouTube is like, there are so many people on YouTube and they all speak really, they speak too slowly.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:43.760
And yes, you

00:14:43.760 --> 00:15:06.700
can like make it faster and it's the, but yeah, I have a very similar feeling and it's, yeah, it makes me happy to see also in the Stack Overflow stats, to see documentation be so significant and also to hear it come up again because, you know, we've always put, like, I've always put so much work into our documentation and I've always been really passionate about documentation and sometimes I've wondered, hey, do people actually read this?

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.760
How much does it really matter?

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.860
And so it's nice to see that it seems to

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:11.980
matter.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.920
What you don't see on this list is podcasts because who would learn from a podcast?

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.500
Oh my gosh.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.720
No, no, no, no, no.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.340
No, no,

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:20.940
no, no, no.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.180
There, auditory material at the bottom.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.120
There you go.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.040
8%.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.400
I used to not think YouTube was important.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.800
I was also in the same boat of like, this is too slow.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.020
Why are people spending this time?

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:39.620
I feel like that's my disconnected, my brain, recreational learning on YouTube.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.780
But my real hardcore learning is probably more blogs and docs.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.600
Yeah, when I want to learn some new language or something, then I go with written things.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.620
Actually, like books.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:53.980
Shocking, I know.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:05.300
But when it's like making skills, like bookbinding or whatnot, then it's certainly YouTube because then it helps to actually see people do that by hand.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.380
It doesn't help me watch someone else code.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:15.800
It helps me to read the documentation and understand how things fit together and click through some library things and such.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.040
but yeah, I don't know.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:25.820
This trend towards everything needs to be a YouTube video that goes like 15 minutes and 10 of those please sponsor me and

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.160
such.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:27.940
It's something I

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.540
don't understand but maybe I'm too old.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:29.960
Smashing the bell

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.440
and all that.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:38.960
I'm surprised AI is so low on the list because that seems like that pair programming I'm going to do it together while some AI explains something to me is pretty effective.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.620
I've seen my kids use that.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.380
I wonder if that's just a time thing.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.440
That was a year ago.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.560
Yeah, it's a year ago.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:46.920
You're right.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.920
Those two, you know, the ChatGPT revolution starts in 23.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.340
Like, it's not in a lot of time.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.240
It feels like forever.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.500
I'm now in the

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.320
insider version

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:57.700
of VS

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.920
Code with that

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.020
build with Claude.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.900
And, like, wow, that thing's a really great tutorial tool.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.420
But that's only been in the past couple of months.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:07.640
Wow.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.720
Yeah, time's flying.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.339
I'm guessing, like, I hear they mean, you know, a chatbot type interface.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:21.339
I mean, I know I keep complaining about this and it's maybe pedantic, but like I'm like, AI already has this terminology problem.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.660
And I feel like, why do you need to call it AI? AI means so many things.

00:17:25.959 --> 00:17:26.079
And

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:26.880
it's like, you know,

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.920
half of these things have AI in them.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.940
And like, what do you mean? Be more explicit.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:38.060
Because I think it's actually for so many things, including how we think about open source software regulation and so on.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:47.860
It's actually a huge issue that we do not distinguish between products like chatbot products and software components, for example, and call everything AI.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.520
And I think ultimately the people that benefit from it most are tech companies.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.760
So I feel like we should stop doing that.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:02.280
So I'm a bit mildly, I mean, not in all, I'm mildly annoyed at Stack Overflow for just calling it AI.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.460
Yeah, I can probably fix it.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.200
Let me just right click inspect.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.140
but in some ways

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.320
it's become the new agile right it's like

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.280
it's a word so overloaded

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.260
and it doesn't mean anything anymore

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.720
yeah yeah

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.040
we're

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:29.480
using agile it just means we stop writing down the waterfall there you go now i know richard you have a interesting uh take on a lot of the stuff like things are ai until

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.680
yeah

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.460
they work and they're proven remember

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:51.700
that ai is a marketing term for raising money, right? Marvin Minsky coins it in the 1950s to get money out of the US military, which by the way, worked. But inevitably, once a technology works, it gets a new name, right? It becomes image recognition or large language models. So as long as it's called AI, you know, it doesn't work.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.860
Yeah, it's still looking for its place in the world.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.920
Yeah, you'll get a new name.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:06.800
All right, so out on the Stack Overflow survey, technical documentation is the number one.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.300
84% of people say that they do that.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.780
Not surprisingly, number two is Stack Overflow, but it's a self-selecting group, so there's that.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.480
Tutorials, blogs, how-to videos.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.300
I mean, I just want to thank you all.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.940
Thank you, everyone, for making me feel weird and being the only one who said YouTube here.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:23.780
Sorry.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.520
No, I'm just teasing.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:32.080
Seriously, for me, when I'm trying to learn, this mostly goes for like frameworks.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:46.660
Like if I want to learn UA framework or I don't know, seeing it built up as sort of a, as somebody's like, we're going to, let me talk you through or show you how I'd build this like sort of start to end.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:51.120
That's really, that really sticks with me better than reading documentation.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.300
And once I see that, then I'll go to the documentation and AI and like, okay, help me click the pieces together.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.840
Anyway, that's my world.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.700
It's proof you have lots of screen space, right?

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.720
That you have your putting window open in one spot.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.220
Then you get the YouTube video up in the top right.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.460
And then you've got the doc down the bottom right.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:08.860
No, I mean,

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:09.400
now that you

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.900
say it, like, you know, it is not actually some of it back what I said earlier.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.140
Also, we did some videos.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.280
I did some YouTube end-to-end tutorials.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.920
And they did quite well.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:25.100
and I still have people to this day come up to me, ask me when I'm doing my next video, say that they've really enjoyed them.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.220
So there's clearly, there is an audience for

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:28.380
it.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.140
Which reminds

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.580
me, I should do another YouTube video.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.260
I

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.200
have like the script ready.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.900
I just, I'm really bad at

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.680
actually recording.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.160
And I have a plural size subscription that comes with, you know, one of the influencer packages.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.500
So I tend to go there.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.420
So it's not like a don't consume video.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:43.900
It's just

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.140
not YouTube.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:55.480
During the pandemic, I had a couple of sessions where I actually just streamed myself while working on Octoprint and explaining my thought process.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:06.520
And that is something that I felt was helping those people a lot who didn't have much development experience at all and were just trying to understand.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.560
And so here's a problem.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:20.300
How would someone who has done this before approach this problem, reduce it into several parts and then approach every single part and the thought cycles that are involved and so on.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.420
For something like that, I think a video is great.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:37.880
But if it's something like technology, like how do I program a command line thingy in Go, for example, that is not something where I would watch a YouTube video for, but rather look up code snippets and then try it on my own.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:47.660
So maybe that's also a thing because you said you want to be, you basically want to move through the process with the developer.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:22:04.080
So maybe that is that kind of approach more where you are trying to wrap your head around what is possible and how can I solve this specific problem versus going into a deep dive into the API or something like that and just figuring out things that way.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.780
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.700
For me, I like to kind of learn.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.760
I want to sort of a surface layer experience of it.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.580
Then I'll want to go a little deeper, then a little deeper instead of trying to like, anyway.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.940
Let's talk experience.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:26.960
Now, I know everyone on this call, we're all pretty young, but we probably have at least five years of experience doing this stuff.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:28.640
No, I know.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.120
We've been doing it

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:29.440
for a while.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:35.660
really quick numbers of your programming top to bottom enos roughly oh

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:50.260
depends how you how do you count like really professionally and doing this job it's like it's over 10 years um i did you know write my you know start writing my first websites uh 24 years ago but

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:50.860
like that was

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:56.600
you know that's like i don't know i would never say like oh i started programming when i was 11 and

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.980
that's how much experience I have.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:58.840
Yeah, no, professionally.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.100
Like

00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.660
really in

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.500
this job and everything, like really doing what I do, like a bit over 10 years.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.040
Awesome.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.940
First line of code.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:08.880
Professionally.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.480
Yeah, professionally would be 25-ish

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.020
years

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.480
ago.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:16.180
In

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:16.480
general,

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.600
35-ish.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:18.380
Yeah.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.080
Something like that.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:19.760
Yeah.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:21.580
Awesome.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.260
Richard?

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.060
Well, yeah.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.840
I mean, when do you get paid, right?

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.720
So I was being paid for code in my

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.260
teens, so 40 years.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.380
Yeah, amazing.

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:36.960
27 years for me.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.840
I was going to say 27 for me as well, I think.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:41.560
Jinx.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:43.480
I

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.420
feel for these people who are in the one to four year range.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.160
I think it's a tough time for those folks.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:53.620
I do

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:53.800
too.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.100
Also, there's a lot of people still joining the industry.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:05.360
Like this, what, 25 to 30% constant ad going into the industry means we're always going to skew young, effectively.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:11.500
Or like early in the, you know, programming journey.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:36.020
Because, you know, I think actually speaking of trends, like what we see, I think especially in AI or in like, you know, the machine learning field, like the most successful projects are those where people upskill and subject matter experts who are like maybe experts in finance in some other area pick up the tools because you know it's never been easier to learn programming and uh solve a problem and i think

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.300
yeah

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:48.640
there we might have people who are actually quite established in their career but only recently learned programming and i think that's an interesting trend and i think with everything um and the way it's going in the field, I think we'll see a lot more of that.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:56.240
Yeah, but is this survey biased that we've got more younger folks maybe replying than older folks on the list too?

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.600
What I mean, interesting

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:11.260
is this big jump there from, like, we are starting at less than a year with 5.5% and then suddenly we spike up to one to four years with 27.3 and then the curve ebbs down again until we are at

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.520
0.1.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:15.600
The less than one year is because they don't find stack overflow.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.060
That is what I'm taking from that.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.440
If

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.880
you're in the one-to-four bracket, you are constantly on stack overflow.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:23.740
And if

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.140
you are earlier

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.720
than that, then you haven't discovered this

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.320
source.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.080
Certainly my experience

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:37.480
consulting into teams is the majority of the developers on a given team are under 10 years of experience.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.540
And they have a senior that's over 10 years.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.140
I would say as well.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.900
And just to give you another perspective.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:51.280
So the people listening, the biggest category is one to four years, 27%, and then five to nine is another 25%.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.300
So over 50% in there.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.220
But most importantly, it's the one to four years, I believe.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.700
We need to keep that in mind.

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:07.140
Now, you could say Stack Overflow is skewing this because people are just hammering on Stack Overflow and trying to figure out what to do when they're brand new.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:19.460
But the PSF JetBrains survey, which didn't have anything to do with code help site like Stack Overflow, I think 40% were less than three years.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.200
40% of the people doing Python have been doing it less, three years or less.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:31.740
And so it's – I think this is a more broad trend, which is something we've got to keep in mind when we're building libraries, building products, doing

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.400
tutorials

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:39.440
and so on, is that a good chunk of your audience will be like, everyone knows what a virtual environment is.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.640
Everyone knows what AC

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:40.940
is.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.360
No, they don't.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:48.120
I take back part of that feeling for those one to four year people is that they also didn't get to experience Python 2.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.460
They only know the view of Python 3.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.260
Their will has not been crushed.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:55.580
They have optimism in their life.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.120
Much less the migration, right?

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.140
Oh, like

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:01.920
writing

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.880
Python 2 and 3 compatible code.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:06.820
Oh,

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:07.800
no, no,

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:07.800
no.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:08.480
Stop, stop.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.820
You're bringing back the nightmares and the headache.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:12.760
What were

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.160
you saying about

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.980
gray hair, Gina?

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.280
Yeah, Python 2

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:16.620
to 3.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.420
At least half of that is from that.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:28.920
Now, on the JavaScript side, now it's relatively hard to find folks that experience Angular 1.1 and the chaos that was moving to 2.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.820
That's now passed.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:31.520
So, yeah, in

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:31.780
a sense,

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.060
new developers coming

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:33.400
in,

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:40.480
they get to benefit from the fact that they're getting into stabler tools with robust solutions.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.520
There's a lot less experimentation, depending on where you're going.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:48.780
I mean, there's nobody with 10 years' experience with an LLM, so everybody's a beginner there.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.260
Yeah, they'll still be able to experience some packaging grief somewhere

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:52.760
along the way.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:53.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.060
I mean, it doesn't matter how

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.780
long you've been doing this, deployment sucks.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:57.620
Yeah.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:07.000
People call everything an LLM now, so in theory I can go around and claim I have 10 years experience in LLMs.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.100
Relatively large language models.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:19.980
Yeah, you probably all have heard the joke, but I imagine many listeners haven't, that Sebastian from FastAPI

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.620
put

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.160
out there.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.040
He said, I just saw a job posting.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.600
He created FastAPI, right?

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.900
And this is two years into it existing.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.240
I just saw a job posting asking for four years of experience with FastAPI.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.800
He's like, I created it.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.640
I only have two

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.680
years experience with it.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.280
I don't know

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.140
who this is for.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.860
Hey, we all have 10 years of experience with AI.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:41.980
Amazing.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:43.340
All right.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.580
Well, hey, if you're a 10X developer, you get 10 years of experience per year.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.220
I mean, come on.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.120
All right.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.400
Let's talk technologies.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.760
And I don't know how you all feel about this.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.920
this sort of like, what is the most popular programming language?

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:00.720
And

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:00.880
again,

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.040
focus on professional.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.560
But I feel there's a lot of things that are not comparable.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:11.320
And this one probably is the most you'll have like SQL versus C++.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.220
You're like, these,

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.260
I don't know, those are the same.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.120
Yeah, CSS

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.400
versus C++, like not the same thing.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.460
Anyway, that rant out of the way.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.880
They qualified

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.200
their heading with putting in their markup languages.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:28.820
Ah, okay.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:29.860
Okay.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.100
But Python and Java and C++ are in there.

00:29:36.059 --> 00:29:38.000
C++ is a hardcore markup language.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:40.760
Anyway.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:41.360
So what was

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:41.720
the original

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.360
question?

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.400
It's just for making scripts.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.660
The original question here.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.920
Let me just give people a quick bit of numbers.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:52.299
JavaScript is number one, which they put up as JS, 64%.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:30:15.040
SQL is number two at 54 HTML, CSS, which again are not the same thing but 52% and then Py, which I assume stands for Python is 46 then TS for TypeScript but then longer words like PowerShell are written out I don't know why some are abbreviated and some aren't nonetheless, that's kind of what it is and the question is which programming, scripting, and markup language have you done extensive development work over the past year?

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:16.560
So

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.000
obviously this panel is fairly

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:30.520
skewed But just maybe give me your perspective on where you see energy going to these days in different languages.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:35.900
Like, for example, in Python, we've seen a lot of people move to Rust, even though most people are still doing Python and so on.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.220
Yeah, and most is a relative concept.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.680
Rust is still, you know, at the edge of the long tail, so to speak.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.540
Yeah, Rust is super, super low, actually.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.660
It's like 2% or

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:47.920
something.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:48.840
You know, it's

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.540
a pretty specialized space to live.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.760
Yeah, it's 11 for Stack Overflow,

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:57.140
but in the trends, I think it's the TOBNX.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:57.860
Speaking of

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.440
trends,

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:02.940
like one thing I would find interesting, can you click on learning to code?

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:05.080
Like it would be interesting because they did separate it out.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:05.980
It'd be interesting to see

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.580
people who are learning.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.620
What are

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.480
they learning maybe?

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:10.240
Right.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.140
I mean, they didn't ask specifically, what are you learning?

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.300
But like extensive development and there we have Python at the top.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.960
Yeah, quite a bit.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.100
And HTML.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:20.220
Okay, I get that.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.100
HTML, CSS, like everyone's putting together stuff on the web.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:29.920
You know, I don't know if everyone read the question correctly and like really thought about extensive development.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.120
Like maybe people thought, hi,

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:31.760
everyone's

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:31.940
hacking.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:39.320
No, I'm sure most people who develop hack around with CSS, with HTML a bit every

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:39.580
year.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.080
Unaboidably.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:41.200
Yeah.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:42.940
So I'm not surprised.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.560
If you gather all the web technologies together,

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.320
it's a web-y world.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.100
If you're making a web

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:56.460
app, you have a lot of different languages and map-up languages you're interacting with, which you don't necessarily have in Python.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.860
In Python, you write Python.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.320
Maybe if you're a library developer, you do some C or Rust.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:02.700
But that's

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.140
kind of it.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:07.620
Whereas, okay, if you're a web developer, you do HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:08.880
TypeScript all

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.020
together.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:13.660
You might do some database as well.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:14.820
You might do VashScript.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:21.340
There's just this huge pile of technologies that come with a certain job, and we just mostly have one.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.920
Yeah, but most Python people are writing a little SQL, too.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.000
You've got to get your data from somewhere.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:27.640
No,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:33.220
but you can have someone else do that.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.040
You can use an existing API.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.620
I don't really write SQL to go on this.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.560
And I think I would know a lot of...

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.880
Also, I like to call it SQL, but that's a different story.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:51.220
But I know a lot of developers, I'm sure, who don't write SQL.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.300
I don't write SQL.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.700
Might not even know it.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.400
What's SQL?

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:57.520
I was just kidding.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:04.640
I honestly, when I'm talking to databases, I use ORMs and ODMs most of the time.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:05.660
I know,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.900
Richard, you're a big database guy.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.800
I've been everywhere

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.140
from one time or another.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:10.940
So SQL is

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:11.340
a friendly

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.020
language to me.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.580
And apparently, according to the professional developer side, lots of people are touching it.

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.800
Yeah, about a third, yeah.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.520
I presume that each respondent checked multiple boxes, because we

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.000
rarely

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.700
actually live in one language.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.420
You usually have to go spend time elsewhere.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.300
Do you read the

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.320
learning to code as, like,

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.360
that's aspirational?

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.800
They wish they were doing Python.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.500
Yeah, interesting.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:33.020
Did

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.200
they ask that question this year?

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:39.040
Because they used to ask that, right, in the developer survey.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.040
Like, what do you wish you were writing?

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.940
Yes, that's

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:49.300
in the most loved and most hated and most wanted.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.480
I don't know if that's in here.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:50.660
Actually,

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.080
let's go down to it.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.640
I think they might have stopped as well.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.360
Gosh, because

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:56.900
I love that.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.460
There's an admired and desired section in 2.2.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.220
Okay.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.320
Let's

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:04.520
see.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.620
Admired and desired.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.540
Yeah, there it is.

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:09.080
Okay.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.700
This is pretty interesting.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.159
Yeah.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.200
what do the bars mean here folks okay hired versus

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.280
desired right

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.240
yeah so

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.240
i admire python but i don't actually want to do it okay so

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:32.139
admired it's red that's like i think this is like a borderline uh content i mean no offense to stack overflow but that's like a borderline contestant for the data is ugly subreddit

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.100
because

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.540
i find this quite hard to read

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:40.340
but again i have no offense to anyone It was just people who made this, and I don't want to be...

00:34:40.379 --> 00:34:40.500
It

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.040
went on green.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.139
I agree.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.000
Can

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.620
someone decipher this for me?

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:49.260
Because I actually don't understand what I'm looking at here.

00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:50.280
Let me describe it

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.460
here.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:50.720
So

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.460
there's a...

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.540
If you go to this section, there's

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.020
two bars.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.320
There's kind of an error bar-looking thing with two numbers.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.640
And it has a range.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.240
The blue one on the left is how desired is it?

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.360
And then there's a red one

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:06.880
that shows

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.240
how admired it is.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:15.080
And you can see the delta, the gap between how much it's wanted versus how much people admire it.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:15.580
So

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.040
Lust is probably the biggest.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.820
Elixir makes the sense to me, right?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:19.680
Because Elixir

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.400
is really

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.020
not easy

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:21.720
to work in.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.020
But it's beautiful when it works.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.140
So it

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:25.560
makes perfect

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.500
sense to me that almost nobody's doing it, but everybody thinks it's cool.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:29.300
Yeah.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.540
77% think it's cool.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.140
5% are doing it or actually want to do it.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.520
Yeah, that

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.120
resonates

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:37.720
with me.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.980
I get that, right?

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.120
That that would make sense.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:53.660
So here we have Python number one, both in absolutely number one and desired, not number one in admired, which is pretty interesting.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:03.000
It's still quite high up there, but there are things like Rust, which is more admired, and Zig, which is wild, and even Elixir, as you point out there.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:08.000
but yeah i think this represents trends pretty well

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.560
yeah when you talk

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:09.740
about

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:16.920
admire it's like who are the cool people that are talking about this like how much did this number move for rust because russinovich was all over

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:33.500
yeah yeah and in python we've got a bunch of tools that have come along especially from the astral folks but others where we've seen huge benefits because people have written in rust i don't know if that's how much of that is we've just put better algorithms into it and how much of it is actually Rust.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.080
But it is Rust and Rust.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:43.640
I think that puts a lot of shine on it, but people are still rather just write Python, but it seems impressive or cool, and I think that kind of gets captured here.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.020
Yeah.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:53.940
Yeah, I think definitely sometimes people ask us, and if we were to rewrite Spacey from scratch, we might...

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.040
Maybe we still use Cython, but maybe we would have also used Rust.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.640
It totally wasn't a thing back then, but I think

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.340
the alternatives

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:07.820
are just C++ Plus or Siphon, which isn't very extensively documented.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.640
So I can see by Rust, it's nice and attractive.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.900
Yeah, quite interesting.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:26.040
I want to cover one more from this section, and then we need to make sure that we save a little bit of time for the AI category, because that's certainly going to be a thing.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.660
And that is cloud platforms.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:44.060
One of the things I find really interesting is how much the big three hyperscale clouds, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, to dominate where people are working.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.660
I don't know how often developers make a decision in this space.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.400
Yeah, you certainly have talked to a lot of larger companies that have really big cloud deployments.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:55.960
Give us your thoughts, Richard.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:56.200
Any

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.300
more than most developers choose what database you're using.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.420
Somebody

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.820
else selected that product and pays for the licenses for it, and you are

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:03.400
going to consume.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:05.980
I

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:10.960
will say of the ones that are on this list, I feel like AWS is the most developer-centric or friendly.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:12.720
I would

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.520
consider Azure

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:19.320
being infrastructure ops-friendly and AWS being like, oh, they're going to throw out a lot more developer-y type things.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.940
We've had a lot of headaches.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:28.900
I'm not an infrastructure person, but I just know we did have some headaches with AWS and Google Cloud.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:34.960
It's like what we ended up migrating to because it's much more

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.620
developer friendly.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:35.900
GCP is the most

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:40.720
developer friendly, but the corp doesn't necessarily like it when you get further afield with it.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:42.600
I think

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.240
what AWS

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.940
has been brilliant at is how they manage their startup relationships.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.280
Once you get to a certain size working with AWS, a tech shows up to help you.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.420
They've done a really good job of cultivating support there, plus they are the reference name.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:02.380
Yeah, and also cultivating developers that specialize in it because ultimately that's kind of how it works.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:11.480
You have DevOps people, and if you do manage significant infrastructure on any of these cloud platforms, you need a developer to do the maintenance on it.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:16.200
That's also something we've realized when we had to downscale some of our operations a bit.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:23.180
The infrastructure is set up so that it needs people to maintain it, so that it can do all of the things.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:35.780
If the company encourages more people to specialize in its platform, then you also have more companies hiring people to do it.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.700
These numbers say they

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:37.840
don't add up to 100%.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:42.180
It's like, listen, as soon as you get to a certain size of an organization, you have more than one cloud in your life.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.240
It's just

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.020
not optional.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:45.700
Question.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:50.460
Can we take a look at the split between professional developers and learning to code, just out of

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:50.840
curiosity?

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.240
Yeah, I don't even

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:52.860
know what I was doing

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.100
over in that learning to code mix.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.060
That doesn't make any sense.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.600
So that is what I would expect.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.000
Now learning to code, please.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.100
So just for people

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.600
listening, AWS, 52%.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:05.120
Azure, 30%.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.720
Google Cloud, 25%.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.420
On the pro developer side.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:10.080
Yeah.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.440
When you're

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.280
learning to code.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:12.780
Ah.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.720
Yeah, Google Cloud is number one at 24% learning code.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.760
But the split is way more distributed across all these

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.600
little areas, which is

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:21.940
interesting.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.140
AWS is 20.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.260
And when you talk

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:24.640
about dev

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.840
-friendly, it's none of the big guys, right?

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.620
Like, first selling Firebase and

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.020
Cloudflare and

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:30.760
DigitalOcean

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.860
even I would put up there.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.760
Much more dev-centric.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:34.140
I

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.960
also am a bit confused about, like, what do they define as cloud here?

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:46.340
Because I would certainly put Amazon Web Services and Azure and stuff into a completely different bucket than a vServer hosted at Hetzner or at OVH.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:55.000
So that is a bit weird because, I mean, I might be missing something, but I think neither OVH nor Hetzner or something like that do have an offering similar

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.640
to AWS and such.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.440
So that's a bit of a mixed bag.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.900
Hetzner has basically...

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.220
Cloud servers.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.240
It has cloud servers, it

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:11.040
has cloud firewalls, and it has a beta version of S3 storage, and that's it.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.800
Yeah, and you can also, you can

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.200
vertically scale and such.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:15.600
They have an API for scaling.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.960
I have all my stuff hosted there, basically.

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:25.700
But it's definitely not the same thing as all of this orchestration stuff that you can do with AWS agents and such.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:27.060
Or

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:27.920
even Cloudflare.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:28.280
So I

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.800
think that's a bit of a mixed thing.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:30.140
It's clearly evidence

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.740
that they ask developers this question,

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:32.900
not the people actually.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.780
Yeah, but what percentage

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:43.300
of the developers are using serverless-y things on Amazon and not just putting up EC2 instances with their stuff in it?

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.700
Would that be an interesting

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.420
question?

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.400
That would be super interesting.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:47.340
Yeah.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.980
Or who does web development?

00:41:50.210 --> 00:42:06.220
Because, you know, we have platforms there that I also use, like Vasell or Netify, which is where we host our stuff, which, you know, if you're learning to build a website, that's the easiest way to just press play and you have a website running, but it might not be necessarily where you would even host the machine learning model.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:13.400
Although it's kind of, I think they're all trying to break into that field as well, but, like, it's, I think it's very use case specific.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.040
Yeah.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.680
Yeah, there's a lot of ways to slice and dice this.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:18.900
Yeah, I think there's

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:19.520
still an interesting question.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.520
There's still developers coming up to terms with containers.

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:27.960
And so they're not even running containers in

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.220
any environment.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:28.740
Yeah, like me.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.580
Certainly in the Microsoft world.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.220
I mean, mentally coming to terms with.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:55.000
The Microsoft world containers, because Windows containers are terrible, Until you're at a place working in.NET where you're comfortable deploying onto a Linux instance, which, by the way, immediately saves you 20%, 25% on your cloud consumption, then containers work.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.480
And now you need to learn all of that as well.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:04.080
Although your AKS is your packaged container services make that a lot easier.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:04.520
So

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.380
folks don't have

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:05.880
to learn it.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.040
They just deploy into a service.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:15.460
Yeah, certainly in that space, a lot of people first have to learn Linux, and then they can learn Docker or even VMs, right?

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:20.640
It's a big lift for a lot of folks that are just like, I have a GUI for my web server.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.180
Is there a container section on this survey that people talk about that?

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:25.440
Let's see.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.820
Although, no.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.940
It falls into Docker as

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:32.740
another tool.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.300
Yeah, it's another tool.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:35.820
Yeah, okay.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.600
So, yeah, I have all of my stuff running over at Hetzner

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:41.980
as well.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:43.500
I'm a massive fan of Hetzner.

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:43.920
This makes me sad.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.220
This is just – Yeah, it does make me sad.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.280
Okay, this is a year ago, but still.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:48.220
Still.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:50.420
Yeah.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.260
I don't even know what – I just can't.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:53.680
I just can't.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.160
It's so spread out all over the place.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:01.400
It's like – I believe there's like – I don't know.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.940
There's things like pip and NPM, but also Kubernetes.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.160
I'm not

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:06.940
really sure they're the same.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:11.160
Or a Visual Studio solution, which is the file format for an application.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.140
That's a

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:12.820
tool?

00:44:15.979 --> 00:44:16.339
This

00:44:16.339 --> 00:44:17.960
is a grab bag of random words.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:18.860
Yeah, it

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.060
is.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.160
We're just going to skip on.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:20.740
All right.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:24.240
We have just a little bit of time for the finale here.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:31.640
I want to put the caveat out here as we talk about the AI section that, one, there's a lot of hype.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.200
It's all over the place.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.280
It can mean different things to different people.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:42.800
Also, as we talked about at the beginning, this is a year old, and a year in AI years is probably like 10 years.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.960
And I do worry about virtue signaling here too.

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:50.760
Just like this is almost asking

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.480
to recycle,

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:52.900
right?

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:53.560
Yeah.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.060
But I break my glass in

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.240
the backyard and just leave it there.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.020
I did

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:05.720
grab the 2023 numbers as well just to compare these two because I didn't follow the instructions on badly behaved.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.560
Oh, no, that's good.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.500
So the key number there, that's 60%, and in 2023 it was 40%.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.020
Okay, 50% growth.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.760
I mean, admittedly, GitHub Copilot at that point was already three years old.

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:27.500
We tend to think from ChatGPT forward, but GitHub Copilot came first, the original Copilot.

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.060
Yeah, for sure.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:29.220
And

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:29.780
it's been there,

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:30.720
it feels like.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.220
I really want to focus on the sentiment and sort of how you all are using this as to kind of close this out.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.460
However, or not using it, which is fine.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.080
But I do want to just, there's a really interesting graph here.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:52.080
If you look at the Stack Overflow language trends, which show how many questions appear on Stack Overflow for that technology.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:58.280
Python has had this meteoric growth, almost hockey stick, not quite.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.860
but almost until 2023, really.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.680
Like late, late 2022, right around

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.420
November.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.020
Is this graph really just showing the demise of Stack Overflow?

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:10.520
Yes.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.720
If you look

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:20.340
at this graph, there's a massive drop of Python there, but there's also a massive drop of JavaScript and some others as well,

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:20.880
but certainly

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.700
the most popular ones.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:28.680
And that is basically when ChatGPT came out, And that is a really interesting developer trend on its own right there.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:34.980
But I do think to put this into perspective, also, are new questions on Stack Overflow a good thing?

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.100
Like, I think that's another, you know, yes, it looks like, oh.

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.060
But, I mean, yeah,

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:40.780
maybe the people

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.500
who would have otherwise opened a question that was already answered, like, two years ago.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:49.060
Yeah, they found their answer on Stack Overflow, on ChatGPT, and that's great.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:53.340
Like, you know, we don't need the internet to be flooded with, like, a lot of redundant information.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:53.840
I know

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.480
to stack overflow.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:03.660
You're hinting at the other aspect of it, which is getting progressively harder to add questions to stack overflow.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:04.220
Yeah.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.340
I

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:07.940
think you're right, Ines.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:11.160
I think people are just going elsewhere, and that's kind of what I was thinking there.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.060
The question

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:19.460
that graph just there, was that questions asked for that thing or search terms for that

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.120
thing?

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:20.700
I believe.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.140
Because it's a huge difference.

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:30.520
over time based on the i think it's question asked yeah or maybe answers as well but it's it's not search terms

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.620
it's okay it's

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.240
content i believe on there

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.480
i just wanted to make sure okay

00:47:36.960 --> 00:48:02.780
and just in case people are worried that maybe it's it's crashing or something you can look at the t the t-o-b t-o-b i can't index i can't type and i know i spelled that but you know what we're going to get that fixed there we go i don't know i just i don't even i mean if you look at python it's still year over year up six

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.520
percent yeah which

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.960
which is not just faster it's like six

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:10.040
it's three to six times fast it is a blowout

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:10.900
level of growth

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.660
and so you're seeing all new depth that's

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:14.220
yeah people

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:20.120
coming in using a chat tool to learn programming and it's really good at python

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.520
If you want to navigate, yeah,

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:28.560
it's VS Code with the free copilot, teach me Python, you're going to have a good experience.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:29.680
Yeah.

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:30.800
All right.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:42.080
With that out of the way, what's your whole sentiment personally for AI and maybe how do you see people adopting?

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:43.520
I love the 20% of the thought.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:43.820
No,

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:44.800
and I don't plan to.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.140
I bet you they all skew older.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.520
Yeah, it's probably true.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.780
Ines, you live somewhat in the

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.380
ML

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:57.660
space.

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:01.340
I mean, you're kind of AI before AI, like legitimately.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:03.380
Yeah, I guess.

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:04.760
I don't know what

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:04.860
AI is.

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.360
You mean generative chat

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:06.640
tools?

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.360
Let's say LLM.

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:08.000
Yeah, let's say

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:08.580
LLMs.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:13.600
Yeah, but like LLMs that generate text for a human to read.

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:18.040
Yeah, because the question is, what tools do

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:24.960
you use So as part of your development process, not as part of your API or for your app to run it, but what do you use to write code, basically?

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:25.620
Let's go with that.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:26.560
Yeah.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:27.080
Yeah.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:40.760
So I don't actually, I don't use many models a lot to, like, actually help me write code because I think the stuff I do is, like, specialized and specific or often, you know, it's, like, very specific things in, like, the libraries we're building, for example.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:49.300
But I do think to explain code to you or for workflows like infrastructure and stuff, that's where it's really helpful.

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:56.840
Also, I know my co-founder, for example, he's done a bunch of quite complex infrastructure stuff, like setting things up with Terraform.

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:01.700
And they're really having a model summarize and explain it to you.

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:03.160
That is very helpful.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:05.960
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:10.140
I've done things like, explain this Docker Compose file to me.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.160
What does this line mean?

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.220
I don't understand this.

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:13.480
Does it mean

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.960
if it fails, it'll restart?

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:15.980
Or if I should have done it restart?

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.140
What does this do?

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.280
And it really is quite good at that.

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.180
Interesting, yeah.

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:24.040
So not so much, you're not vibing.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.120
Let's put you as the non-vibing.

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:26.400
Yeah,

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:27.180
yeah.

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:39.500
But I found out that actually, because we've always, I think I might have mentioned this before in another context, but we've always put a lot of, in the libraries we write, a lot of work into all this backwards compatibility stuff, making sure we don't break users code.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:47.800
And this actually had a very positive side effect, which is that these models are really good at writing, for example, spacey code.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.620
And it's never something we planned.

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:55.660
We were just like, oh, we just want to do all the boring stuff right and make our users happy.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.140
But yeah, this really paid off.

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:03.320
Like I've heard these models, Copilot, ChatGPT, are really good at writing code for our libraries.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.180
And you

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:06.320
were

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:06.620
admitting

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:08.060
that's a good documentation, right?

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.400
And we always put a lot of work into our documentation.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:11.800
I think

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.560
that may have added to that as well.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:16.500
Yeah.

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.760
Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.040
Gina, what do you think?

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.580
I know you're not a super--

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.140
No.

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.660
You're not an AI accelerist,

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:25.160
let's say.

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:28.820
Let's say I consider myself an AI skeptical.

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:30.920
So

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.860
the thing with

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:41.660
me is when Copilot came out as a GitHub star, I had a very early access to it and then I started using it and I allowed it to autocomplete a lot of my lines.

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:50.540
I found it an amazing help in translating my stuff because I write everything in Octoprint in English first and then the whole UI needs to be translated to German on every release.

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:57.120
And doing that by hand is a lot of work and having the I make suggestions is really nice in that case.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:03.040
And then AI started to get shoved into my face from every place all around me.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.880
And I read up on the energy consumption of that stuff and the water consumption of that stuff.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:11.380
And that they were thinking about firing up additional power thingies again just for

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:11.780
that stuff.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:14.880
And that was when I decided, okay, I'm not going to use this anymore.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.340
I'm refusing to use this.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:22.600
And I have disabled co-pilot and try to not touch anything AI if I can.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:28.920
simply because I don't like how it is getting pushed into everyone's throat these days, down

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.960
everyone's throat these days.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.560
I actually do

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.460
have a free account on ChatGPT.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:41.000
I sometimes have the problem that I forget words in English or in German that I can still remember how to describe.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:45.400
And then when I do not have anyone I can describe that to, I can describe it to ChatGPT.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:50.080
And then it tells me, oh, you did mean, I don't know, interface or something like that.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:51.560
And then I'm like, yay, exactly.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.800
and I'm happy. But other than that, I don't touch that with a 10-foot pole anymore, because simply it's just too much. I don't like

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.940
hypes at all.

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.860
But what do you mean it's generative models?

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:06.420
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.740
No, you are completely

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:10.240
right,

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:14.800
because I get this little shock every time that I am also into game development.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:23.160
And now every time that I read or watch a video about how to build some kind of AI for a game, my initial

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.100
reaction

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:38.800
is always AI and then I realize no stop that's a good type that's the thing that makes the characters and NPCs walk around and such and pathfinding and whatever right but yeah I'm totally with you I just suffer from the same problem apparently yeah

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:47.580
yeah you're a very principled person I definitely admire that about you it's tough I think I do hate having AI jammed into everywhere.

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:52.580
Like my email client can rewrite stuff with the AI.

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:53.940
It almost

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:54.680
never comes

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:55.280
out the way I want.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.100
And when I do all the formatting is lost.

00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:59.020
Yes, I

00:53:59.020 --> 00:53:59.200
know.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:09.940
And do you get comments like that where I'm like, I know exactly like, why do you want to encourage people to write these shitty comments on posts that add absolutely nothing and essentially

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:10.440
spam?

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.300
And that you then need

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:16.420
another chat thingy to parse again in order

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:17.180
to summarize.

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:21.340
That's like completely, like, yeah, why?

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:23.180
I know it.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:23.560
All right.

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.320
Well, you don't have a time level.

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.400
I've got to keep moving along here.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:27.080
All right.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.220
Richard, where are you on this?

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:30.720
Well, look,

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:37.760
you know, I'm talking to a lot of PMs and things who are saying my team is 25, 30% more productive using these tools.

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.440
And they can see just more check-ins of more code

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.380
with fewer remediations.

00:54:45.619 --> 00:54:52.720
What we saw in the first six months of the team using it is more reverts because they were overcommitting with the code they

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:53.560
didn't fully understand.

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:55.800
But over time, they got better at it.

00:54:56.050 --> 00:55:00.620
And when they actually got to the PR and merge, the code stuck.

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:10.460
So there was a lot of fewer problems net to the point now where it's like, I kind of can't hire anybody if they're not using these tools because it's like they're not using an editor.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:14.660
The productivity level is substantial if they're in the workflow.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:15.220
And

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:15.920
I noticed going

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:21.960
further down the list of data here, like the AI and the development workflow, they're using it for writing code.

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.120
That's what it's doing.

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:31.000
It's code completion and it's, you know, describe the problem and it gives you a first gen and you can iterate a couple of times on it.

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:32.980
But this is also a year ago.

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:33.840
Like the ability

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.160
to write

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:40.740
PR explanations and things was only just emerging when this survey was being done.

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:46.000
Today, I notice everybody's PR explanations are wildly better

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.280
because they didn't write them.

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:48.980
The tool did.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.080
Yeah, I've seen that.

00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.380
And also maybe as

00:55:53.380 --> 00:56:03.020
a bit of a positive outlook, like I do think we're already seeing that it's possible to use local models and use much smaller models, you know, that you can actually run.

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:07.740
on your laptop and with the device constraints that you have.

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.180
And it's like, it is a subset of things.

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:20.560
I think I was just reading something today about also Visual Studio Code supporting more local models and adding more features for that.

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:20.860
So I

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:22.840
think, because it's such a specific thing.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.380
I feel like we're starting to right-size now.

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:24.980
That it's,

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:25.660
you know,

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:29.460
the initial iterations of these products, we're throwing as much meat at them as possible as they

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:30.060
weren't sure they were going

00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:30.340
to work.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:35.420
And now it's like, hey, too much is also a problem because it goes off on weird wandering.

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:36.640
And we've been able to know.

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.080
Yeah, and also I think companies

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:43.100
can have their own internal fine-tuned models as well, like something really small.

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:49.320
Okay, that model just writes PR descriptions for our team that works in this field with Python.

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:50.260
And then it's small.

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:51.460
Everyone runs it locally.

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.420
It's data private.

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.300
You don't need to send your shit to

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.080
GitHub,

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.500
to Microsoft, to OpenAI.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.340
It's like it all stays internal.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.940
and you have control over it.

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:04.060
And I do think that would be a good compromise

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:06.820
and solve

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:07.780
a lot of the problems.

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:14.080
But of course, it's something that there are a lot of companies out there, especially very large companies that do not like this kind of vision.

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:33.440
And yeah, that's also why I'm so passionate about not calling everything AI because ultimately, it really just benefits big tech who likes having us call chatbots and open source software into the same bucket and regulate it exactly the same way because...

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.720
This is the problem with the hype cycle.

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:36.800
As you go

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.380
following

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:44.020
Gartner's pattern, into the trough of disillusionment, you do end up with dumb regulations to respond

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.180
to social concerns

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:46.760
rather than thoughtful,

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.240
here

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.440
are the different problems and how we can scope them more.

00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:54.580
And lobbied by companies like OpenAI, for example.

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.880
The incumbents want to lock in their

00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:58.180
admin.

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.440
Where's our regulatory capture,

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:00.820
please?

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:01.180
We need

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:02.100
to work that in to

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:02.880
the various places.

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:04.620
All right, Calvin.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:14.160
Well, for folks who know me, they probably know that I'm an eternal optimist and I'm definitely very excited about the AI developer tools.

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:20.240
I'm actually giving a talk on it like next week at IndiePy about this because there's so many good options out there.

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:26.640
Now that said, I feel like these tools definitely benefit at the senior coders more than they do the junior coders.

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:35.160
Like I feel like this whole, every time I hear the word vibe coding, I shudder kind of like Gina does around anything that says AI.

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:43.480
So I think there's a great potential for a lot of tech debt to be produced very, very quickly with those kinds of tools.

00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:49.340
And I feel like under poor guidance or poor mentorship, there's a lot of damage that could be done.

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.460
But the upside is so good.

00:58:52.120 --> 00:59:05.060
Kind of like Richard, Like, we're probably only going to hire somebody who is basically augmenting their personal skills with a set of tools behind them that make them perform at a higher level just in general.

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:06.980
There's so much upside to it.

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:08.280
And I do love the local tools.

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:12.660
Like, I run Mistral Small and Llama 3.3, all that stuff locally.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.500
And so nothing's going off my laptop to interoperate with a lot of my tooling.

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.760
There's so many good open source options, too.

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:33.920
I know a lot of people are excited about like QuadCode and Copilot, but the Ader chats, the Goose clients, those things are really incredible, and they're open source.

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:34.760
They all run local.

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:40.720
I want to jump on the terminology bandwagon.

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:44.160
They're agentic, another terrible abused word

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:44.960
that everyone

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:54.600
thinks they're using, but the tools like Goose and Ader will run commands locally on your machine as a proxy to figure out things.

00:59:54.760 --> 01:00:00.160
And I love that capability that is now doing an introspection, exploration, understanding.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.780
It's really a great usage of the reasoning models.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.700
And being able to use multiple models simultaneously against the code base is really, really powerful.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.440
And I don't think a lot of developers see that.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:15.960
I think a lot of people just jump into a ChatGPT or a quad and try and just brute force their way to a solution.

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:17.120
And I don't think that's the right approach.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:25.280
I would love to see more folks take a measured approach at this and really make it small incremental improvements.

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.580
And you get a lot of win there.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.840
Is that the topic of your

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.180
talk?

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:32.660
Are you going to talk about that?

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:33.280
A

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:33.460
bit.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:33.680
So

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:39.040
I'm going to take five of the current developer tools like that and compare them.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.360
I'm going to basically take a...

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.440
Oh, that's cool.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:41.980
You need to

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.680
send me the slides.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:44.140
I

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:44.500
really want

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:51.340
to check it out because I recently just had a conversation with a journalist who wanted to know about these things and brought down some of the thoughts.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.020
And it actually really mirrored what you all have been saying.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.000
So,

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.220
yeah, I want to look deeper into this.

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:01.420
Yeah, because some of them have superpowers that are different than the others.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:01.920
And I

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.680
don't think folks understand

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.080
that either.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.500
Like, for example, the

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.160
goose.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.400
No, it's a goose.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.360
Goose is very get aware.

01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:09.380
No, I'm sorry.

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:09.940
Take that back.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.660
AderChat. Even in my brain, they don't say straight.

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:16.400
AderChat is very Git aware, and it uses it as its undo function.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:30.900
And it's very deeply, like the prompting that they put into it understands Git really, really well, which means it can quickly discern what's going on in a code base because it basically does a mapping of your repository structure and then uses that to know when to pull stuff in.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.620
Again, I'm super positive and pro on this stuff.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:40.100
And the fact that Ader can use local models, mix them with anything else you want to pull in there, It's really flexible.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.000
You're not tied to some AWS or Google or OpenAI or Anthropoc.

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.740
I'm also interested in this.

01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:50.360
Are you going to be recording that talk or streaming?

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:50.660
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.580
It'll be recorded and it'll be streamed.

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:53.480
We'll have it online.

01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:53.780
Good.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:54.120
So I

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.260
could go back to YouTube and watch it there like

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.100
I do not have to.

01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:59.660
Or you all can join and ask great questions.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.120
Awesome.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:00.460
Okay.

01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:01.220
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:01.520
No,

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:02.360
it does sound super.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:02.760
IndiePy

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.000
.org,

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.360
a little plug for, I'm a co-organizer, co-founder of IndiePy, the local Python group here too.

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:09.740
In Indianapolis?

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:10.620
Yeah.

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:11.920
In Indiana,

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:12.140
yep.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.340
I would say, well, for me, I've definitely gone on a journey through all of this stuff.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:27.120
When I first saw it, I still to this day feel like LM's probably border on copyright theft.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:30.860
So I'm a little displeased with it.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.120
Well, maybe a lot displeased.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.760
But at the same time, that horse is out of the barn.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.560
It's not coming home.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.720
It's gone, right?

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.280
And so then you got to say, well, now what are we going to do?

01:02:42.579 --> 01:02:47.580
Am I going to just pretend this doesn't exist because I'm a little bit put off by that?

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:58.580
When everyone else is using it to create libraries, tools, applications, content, et cetera, that's not that reasonable either, right?

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.520
You kind of, to Richard's comment about the productivity, right?

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:02.800
You

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.400
got to be practical.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:11.540
And I also found them to be fairly mind-blowingly cool but somewhat inaccurate.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:15.100
But that's kind of like a 2023, 2024 version.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:15.800
Now,

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.340
if you get to the higher-level models, they are so good.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:34.900
They are so powerful and so effective that if you stopped messing with them a year ago because you don't want to because you thought, oh, they're not really that accurate, I would encourage people to look at it again and maybe look at Calvin's talk.

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:43.240
And then Gina, for your concerns, I also share those, although I definitely have a ChatGPT subscription these days.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:47.920
Check out stuff like LM Studio and other ways of running it local, right?

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.600
Like you can avoid a lot of the melting the power grid.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.540
I mean, then I'm paying for the energy cost.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.500
That's also a problem.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.160
Yeah, but it's not that.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.320
You can

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.200
run

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.560
lower models that take

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.960
not that much time.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.280
I mean, most of the energy costs is training.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:06.700
Apple Silicon

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.660
is so efficient, I mean, efficient relatively to everything else out there.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.200
It's so efficient.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.080
Yeah.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.360
And we haven't gotten to optimized yet.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.440
No, yeah, you're right.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.020
And we're still in

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:17.560
its infancy.

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:25.140
Yeah, this is, in five years, it's going to be, the local models especially, I think, are going to be really much more capable.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.980
We saw DeepSeq already.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.000
And this is driving innovation around

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:30.740
abundance.

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:36.340
I think we're going to have new solutions to these energy problems, new solutions to the cooling problems.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.980
We can't continue, obviously, down this route.

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:45.700
I do share Gina's concern, but again, I think I come at it with a very optimistic, maybe overly optimistic view.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:47.660
Maybe I wish I was a little more

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:50.460
realistic about

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:50.620
it.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.300
I think Gina is right that there is a problem that has to be addressed.

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.240
Yeah, but also we

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.380
are coming out of this hype.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:58.980
Yeah.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:07.700
I don't know what the Gartner cycle is calling it again, but I call it the post-hype hangover sort of in that phase.

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:08.060
And

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:08.500
I think

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.540
then there's going to be a more reasonable mindset.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:21.780
I've always been advocating for smaller models, more task-specific models, using these large generative models to create systems rather than as systems.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Using them as systems, that's kind of 2023.

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:29.060
What we're doing now is using them

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.020
to help

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:36.320
us write code, but also using them to create data for smaller models, which is probably possible.

01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:37.740
And that's not old NLP.

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.560
That's just, yeah, next level.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.620
Maybe to not only say something negative about that, also maybe something positive on my side about that stuff.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.080
So I find it very interesting.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.320
And I think there are some great tools or going to be some great tools.

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.640
They're utilizing this technology.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:06:02.500
But only if the person using it is actually able to determine whether that stuff it is outputting is actually good.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:03.500
Yeah.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:10.960
Only if it is, it doesn't necessarily have to run locally, at least not for me, because I am developing open source anyhow.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.620
So everything I do is going to be out in the open anyhow.

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:18.420
But yeah, some privacy aspects are also something that are to be considered.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:19.440
So local would be nice.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.460
Lower energy costs.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.500
And please allow me to disable this stuff when I don't want to use it.

01:06:29.059 --> 01:06:43.080
Because I don't want to have every single tool start waving at me all the time going, hey, by the way, you can also now use my chatbot interface when I'm like, no, I'm just happy if you list my files here, dear file listener.

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.220
If I list that,

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:44.920
something

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.560
like that.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:57.660
The other day I was looking for a new terminal and found stuff that was also trying to tell me that it has AI in it, whatever they meant with that.

01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.520
But I don't need a chatbot interface when I'm trying to write bash.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.800
So thank you very much.

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:03.080
So

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.260
give me an off switch.

01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:05.940
Allow me to run this stuff locally.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.920
And yeah, don't shove it down my throat.

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:14.180
And also don't try to plaster it all over the place as the solution for every single problem.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:25.500
Especially for people who don't fully understand the problem space yet, because then we also get like in the open source situation, we also get a lot of issues now generated with

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:25.860
AI,

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:26.860
security

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:27.260
tickets

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:36.780
generated by AI, like suggestions from people to help other people generated by AI that are completely wrong and are causing more problems than anything.

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:41.340
So if all of this stuff stops, then yes, then I will take another look.

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:45.380
But until then, I'm just fed up up to here with that.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.280
And I can't

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:46.820
stand it anymore.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.040
No, I agree.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.860
I mean, and I work very closely in the space.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.040
And I absolutely agree with your points.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:56.820
All right, everyone.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.040
I think we're just getting started.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.260
We could go for a very long time,

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.100
but we also are out of time.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:06.800
So Ines, Gina, Richard, Calvin, thank you all for being here.

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:07.820
it's been a lot of fun

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:09.760
thank you

01:08:11.279 --> 01:08:11.820
bye all
