00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello, everyone out there in the live stream.


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hello, Laura.


00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
How are you doing?


00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm doing pretty well.


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
How are you doing?


00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Fantastic.


00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Fantastic.


00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.080
So excited to have you here.


00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.080
If you're watching live, feel free to put questions, comments, feedback into the live


00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.080
stream.


00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.400
And with that, let's get started.


00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.560
Laura, welcome to Talk Python To Me.


00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.560
Thank you very much, Michael.


00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.560
Happy to be here.


00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.020
Yeah, I'm so happy to have you here as well.


00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.060
you're doing a whole bunch of interesting things


00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.280
around open source and the US government.


00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.780
And I find government to be so interesting


00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.940
because there's a lot of data,


00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.740
there's a lot of technology,


00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.380
there's many users, right?


00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.900
We've got 300 million users in the US or so,


00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.420
in some sense.


00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.540
And yet a lot of times the technology there


00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.860
feels so old and ancient.


00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.100
And yet what you're building


00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.900
and some of the change that you're leading


00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.620
is very modern, right?


00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.220
You could put this up beside a lot of the startups


00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.320
in Silicon Valley and it would look amazing still.


00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.900
So, well done.


00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.020
- Well, thank you so much for your kind words.


00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.120
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.280
Now, before we dive into all the cool Python things,


00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.680
let's just start with your story.


00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.240
How'd you get into programming in Python?


00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.080
- I'm sure.


00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.260
So, I have always been interested in computers.


00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.260
I love to tinker with the computers at home,


00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.020
but I couldn't say that I had a natural aptitude


00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.020
for software development.


00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.060
I took classes in high school and college.


00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.140
I thought I wanted to be a computer science major


00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.580
and really struggled with writing software.


00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.980
And it was a very exciting time politically at the time.


00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.460
So I decided I wanted to be a political science


00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.820
and history major.


00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.180
And my mom really encouraged me to finish my minor,


00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.060
which was great advice, mom, thank you.


00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.120
I finished my computer science minor.


00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.660
And when I first graduated,


00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.860
I really wanted to get involved in campaigns.


00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.860
It was 2007, 2008, and I found a, I'm from DC,


00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.540
I came back to DC, I found a local political software


00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.460
company that was hiring.


00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.500
And I had originally interviewed for a administrative


00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.740
assistant position and the founder recommended I work


00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.820
in tech support.


00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.160
And I was really surprised because I felt like I didn't know


00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.820
what I was doing, but it was a really great organization.


00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.020
It taught me everything I need to know.


00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.420
and I really loved--


00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.220
- Did you have one of those experiences where you're like,


00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.420
oh, there's no way I can help out


00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.540
with this tech support stuff.


00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.380
And then you get there and you're like,


00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.140
oh, actually, I'm actually able to help quite a bit.


00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.140
- Yeah, you learn some skills.


00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.060
So we had one major system that we supported


00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.540
and then a couple other smaller software.


00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.260
And I never really learned how to use myself.


00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.140
So you learn some tricks like,


00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.180
so walk me through the exact steps you've taken so far.


00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.860
And then you sort of follow along with them.


00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.980
And you're like, have you tried clicking this?


00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.860
this looks promising, let's try clicking on this


00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.860
and see what happens.


00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.000
Yeah, tech support was a great first job out of college.


00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I learned a lot.


00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.420
It helped me with my creative problem solving skills.


00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.620
And I really learned the software well


00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.820
to the point where after a few years of tech support,


00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.940
I would send the developers the line of code


00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.780
where the bug occurred and say,


00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.260
here's the bug that the user reported.


00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.420
So they asked me to come work on the development side


00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.620
And I did that for a little while,


00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.660
and then I was still struggling with my confidence.


00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.580
It wasn't really a great fit,


00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.260
and I couldn't quite figure out why.


00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.940
I didn't have a lot of support.


00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.620
This was kind of, this is before a lot of the meetup culture.


00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.020
This was 2012.


00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.220
Now I found there are a lot of communities


00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.020
for helping people get into tech.


00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.820
- Yeah, the communities have really grown a lot


00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.940
in the last five years or so.


00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.180
It's a lot nicer than it was. - Absolutely.


00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.500
- Yeah, and DC wasn't really a tech hub.


00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.340
It wasn't really known for being much of a tech hub.


00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.700
So I had a lot of self-doubt


00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.020
and I wasn't sure that being a developer was right for me.


00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.780
But while I was working at this company,


00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.980
it was a company that helped campaigns


00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.820
file their campaign finance disclosures, the FEC.


00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.620
So political campaigns in the US need to disclose money


00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.120
that they've raised and spent towards their election.


00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.120
And it's sort of like--


00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.920
- Is this if they've privately done it


00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.040
or through the government support


00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.240
or something like that, right?


00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.080
- You have options.


00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.360
FEC provides free filing software


00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.000
and it's everything you might imagine


00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.200
free government software might look like.


00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.160
And we're working on that.


00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.760
But there are also third-party companies


00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.680
like the equivalent of like a TurboTax


00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.880
for filing campaign finance disclosures.


00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.520
And so that's what that company did.


00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.000
And I just fell in love with all the rules


00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.160
the campaign finance, it's sort of like


00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.440
super nerdy, like


00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.960
anyone who gets excited about filing


00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.920
their taxes and all the different


00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.640
scenarios.


00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.320
It's very similar amount of rules for


00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.880
who can give how much,


00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.080
under what circumstances. And there are


00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.240
situations where


00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.560
individuals can gift goods and services


00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.160
to campaigns, but there are restrictions on


00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.360
on those types of gifts. So I really


00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.320
just enjoyed


00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.400
that world, campaign finance. Yeah.


00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.080
even though I had been a political science major in college, I actually hadn't learned


00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:25.160
that much about the FEC and campaign finance laws and regulations. And it was kind of before


00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.760
campaign finance was a hotbed issue. It can sometimes be a hotbed issue now, but this was


00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.600
not something we covered a lot in class. It's not something that was getting covered a lot


00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.840
in the media. So it was through work that I learned about FEC disclosure rules and


00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.880
campaign fundraising, whereas before I had really learned more about voting. So the fundraising is


00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.040
what allows the running of the campaign to take place. Yeah, so much, at least in the U.S., is


00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.880
about running ads and hiring people to go out and knock on doors and all sorts of stuff like that,


00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.520
right? So even though you really, you hope it's kind of some sort of meritocracy and you debate


00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.200
and then you choose the ideas, there's monies involved. Yes, it has become a hot bed topic in


00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.280
in a lot of ways, but I think at the time I was learning about it, it was the money


00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.320
was often thought to be an indicator of support. So if you could raise a lot of money from


00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.680
a lot of different people, it was an indicator that you had widespread support and that those


00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.880
folks were, you know, even if they were just giving you $20 towards the campaign, they


00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.040
would help you support, like have office space and like you said, print ads.


00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.920
It's some sort of, if you're going to give money, you're likely you would vote for them,


00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.920
giving money is a bigger signal than actually voting,


00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.400
so it's an early signal, I guess.


00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.280
- Absolutely.


00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.040
So I wasn't sure being a software developer


00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.160
was right for me, so I went to go work for the FEC


00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.780
in a less technical role,


00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.440
where I worked to help the FEC


00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.440
with more of the enforcement side of things,


00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.940
making sure that the campaign finance reports


00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.200
were filled out properly,


00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.360
that if people had questions


00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.840
about how to comply with the law,


00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.340
if there's any disparities


00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.980
or anything that was unclear on the reports,


00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.440
I would help send correspondence on the public record,


00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.940
asking the regulated community,


00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.460
the campaigns and the PACs and parties


00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.300
to further clarify their reports.


00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.620
And there was an element of tech support in that role.


00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.900
I also did tech support for the free filing software.


00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.060
And anyone who's done tech support,


00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.820
sometimes I can get pretty,


00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.100
like answering the same question over and over again,


00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.620
no matter how much you care, it can sort of wear on you.


00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.220
So I was looking for a challenge.


00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.220
- I'm so happy to have your question.


00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.900
I'm really here to support you for the 100th time.


00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.300
- Yes, and this is the first time they're asking.


00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.500
- Yeah, of course, they don't know.


00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.140
- Right, and there are a lot of very confusing rules.


00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.860
And some of the best advice I got from my supervisor


00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.500
was you don't have to defend the agency.


00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.740
So if someone says, "This is really confusing,"


00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.780
you can say, "It is confusing.


00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.320
let me see if I can help you work through it,


00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.880
instead of trying to defend the regulations.


00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:14.220
And so after about five years of doing that job,


00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.480
I wanted a challenge, I wanted a change.


00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.560
And there was an opening on the website project team


00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.720
for FEC.gov.


00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.360
And my mentor at the time had recommended


00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.240
that I come work on this project.


00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.240
It was a really cool project


00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.920
and I can talk about why it's cool.


00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.720
And I said, "Oh, I haven't written a line of code


00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.160
in five years, you know, there's no way I can work there.


00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.440
And I met with the team and they were willing to,


00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.800
if I was willing to work hard to get up to speed,


00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.200
they were willing to work with me


00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.600
since I had a lot of knowledge about the area


00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.240
and past experience.


00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.320
So basically did a crash course in Python


00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.520
with a lot more support this time around.


00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.760
There are all these organizations in DC


00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.520
for underrepresented genders in tech


00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.080
and just new developers.


00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.960
And so really did a deep dive and kind of was able


00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.680
to talk myself onto the team and was drinking


00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.680
from the fire hose and really just really had fun though.


00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.080
It was super fun.


00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.920
- That's cool.


00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.300
You know, one of the things that I hear in your story here


00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.120
that sounds a little bit different


00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.320
between the two experiences,


00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.280
you're going to college and getting your minor in CS


00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.680
versus being really passionate about the politics


00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.960
and elections and then learning code


00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.000
to sort of advance that mission.


00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.600
Those are really different in that,


00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.240
so often in computer science,


00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.920
it's like, well, here's some random algorithm.


00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.080
We're gonna study the algorithm.


00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.540
Then you can reproduce the algorithm


00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.360
and how boring and dry and separated


00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.880
from what you're interested in is that, right?


00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.620
Whereas this is like, well,


00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.640
I've got to go through this technology


00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.080
to use it as a way to really achieve the goals I'm after.


00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.880
And I think those are just such different experiences.


00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.720
Would you agree?


00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.540
- Absolutely.


00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.680
I distinctly remember one of my projects in college


00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.240
was to build a calendar.


00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.460
And I was like, I have a calendar.


00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.920
(laughing)


00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.760
- You've got a paper one, I got a digital one.


00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.000
- Oh, yeah.


00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.180
And so I just wasn't very passionate


00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.540
about some of the projects.


00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.640
And they're good projects for teaching the concepts,


00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.880
but not necessarily, it can be difficult to find.


00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.680
And I think there's been a reevaluation


00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.280
of how certain ways of writing software is taught


00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.880
a little more beginner friendly.


00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.400
I, yeah, I sort of lost that train of thought, but yes.


00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.840
- Yeah, I think if you have a goal


00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.080
and you have something you want to build


00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.300
and you know why you wanna work on it,


00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.400
well, then it's super exciting.


00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.140
But if it's just dry, I think we lose a lot of people


00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.600
who don't have some sort of personal drive


00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.680
that's gonna get them through


00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.440
that is not necessarily part of the lessons


00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.960
or part of the official experience, you know?


00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.800
- Absolutely, and the thing I wanted to add to that


00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.700
is that I didn't learn at the time I was in school,


00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.860
I was studying computer science


00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.000
and I've sort of figured out that software development


00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.540
and computer science can be somewhat different disciplines.


00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.820
And I never learned how to really write software in college.


00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.380
And what I've learned the hard way is to really start small,


00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.680
get the smallest piece working,


00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.620
change the smallest part of it.


00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.020
And can you make that even smaller?


00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.540
Maybe just hard code something for now.


00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.500
Whereas before I would write in college,


00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.820
right top to bottom, write the whole thing out and then it would just explode about a semicolon


00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:33.860
buried on line 463. So those learning those skills has helped made it a lot more fun,


00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:40.820
a lot less miserable. Yeah fantastic. So I think you've given us quite a bit of background already


00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:47.940
about the FEC, Federal Election Commission, but I think two things are interesting to talk about


00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:55.460
real quickly here. One is this whole agency was born, I guess just a tiny bit before I was


00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:03.460
actually, but it was born out of a financial scandal in 1972, right? Yes, after the Watergate


00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:10.100
scandal. Yeah, I bet people have heard of that one. I hope so. Yeah, I would hope so too.


00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:19.380
The other thing is, you look at the FEC and you said it's not a huge organization, the government,


00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.740
but how many people work there?


00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.020
We have about 300 full-time employees.


00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.220
That's federal employees, so they work for the US government.


00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:33.540
And on FEC.gov, we have a team of about, we have a cross-functional team,


00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:39.300
but we have about nine developers and a user experience designer who work on the technical side of the site.


00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.300
Yeah, cool. So it's a pretty small group of developers,


00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.660
probably all work pretty closely.


00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.980
I'm sure it's a fun place to be.


00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.060
- It really is.


00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.660
- Yeah, and before we move on too far from the opening,


00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.060
Kim Van Wyk, who was one of the Ask Me Anything hosts,


00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.260
if I may hear you, Kim, says,


00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.660
"I strongly suspect that it also helps you remember


00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.180
"a software topic six months later


00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.060
"if you did something you found interesting


00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.620
"while learning it."


00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.540
Yeah, yeah, I would definitely say so.


00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.620
- Absolutely.


00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.660
- All right, so as we get into the code side of things,


00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.400
maybe we could talk a little bit about the type of data


00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.740
to give people a sense of what we're working with here.


00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.100
So one of the things you can do is you can go to fec.gov


00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.080
and you can go to all data and there's all kinds of stuff


00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.420
you can learn about raising money, spending money,


00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.720
candidates, I can go over here, I could select


00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.100
my state, Oregon, I could go pick my location


00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:38.100
around Portland and pull that up and it'll do things like,


00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.580
I could go up and say, learn about the house, I guess.


00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.420
And it'll show this person in this party raised,


00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.420
you know, $64,000 and had $110,000 disbursements.


00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:55.100
How much cash they have on hand right now.


00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.860
So apparently $711,000, which is kind of insane.


00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.980
And then you can go see the sources for this data.


00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.720
Tell us about the kind of data and how people use it there.


00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.660
- Sure.


00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.260
- Yeah, that's a great, our election profile pages,


00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.040
I'm really proud of those.


00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.720
We can see who's running in each election.


00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.560
But the data-- - Yeah, it's beautiful


00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.520
and you get like a colorful map of the areas,


00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.360
you just click on it and it pulls it right up.


00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.500
It's really neat.


00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.340
- Thank you so much.


00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.060
And as you were demoing it live here, it was looking snappy,


00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.300
which just really warmed my heart.


00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.260
- It's very snappy.


00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.000
- So when we think about filing our taxes with the IRS,


00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.440
in the US at least, we have to disclose


00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.980
how much money we made and various other,


00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.740
basically the money we made in our taxes,


00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.020
but it's all summary level data.


00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.780
Campaigns need to file not only the summary level data,


00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.860
but also the transaction level data.


00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.860
So from every contributor who's given an aggregate


00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.740
of $200 or more in a given election,


00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.460
they have to disclose their name and address,


00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.900
employer occupation, and the details of that transaction.


00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.500
And so it's a large volume of data.


00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.860
So if you look at the-


00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.340
- Especially at the presidential level


00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.060
or national level? - Yes, presidential level,


00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.160
I mean, like hundreds of millions of records.


00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.100
I think we're on track to have a total of 1 billion records


00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.300
by the end of the 2022 elections.


00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.260
And it's just a lot of data.


00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.220
So it's not just how much they've raised,


00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.780
it's the individual contributions that go into that.


00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.500
So from here, if you wanted to click on the name


00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.700
of the candidate you're looking at for your district,


00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.620
it'll take you to the candidates profile page.


00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.540
It looks like this is a house candidate


00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.560
and they run every two years.


00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.160
So there's a browse receipts button.


00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.080
So you can actually see the individual contributions


00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.020
that made up and it's 2022.


00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.700
There hasn't been a lot of data yet for 2022


00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.300
because it's early in the election cycle, but at the top.


00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.140
- Oh my gosh.


00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.860
So I'm in here looking at this and it says,


00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.860
Here is Diane Snow, who donated how much?


00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.340
$50.


00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.660
These are individual contributions


00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.700
and all sorts of stuff, right?


00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.860
This is crazy detail.


00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.940
- Yes, and we've had detailed,


00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.060
it's part of our mission to make detailed contributor data


00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.460
and not just contributor, but expenditure data,


00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.340
how the committees are spending their money


00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.540
since back to the late '70s.


00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.820
So we do have all the historical data here to explore.


00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.660
You could export this to Excel spreadsheet


00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.980
or technically it's a CSV, but at the top of the page,


00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.980
you could filter for like all the money


00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.860
that's been received for 2022.


00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.540
So you could eliminate your,


00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.740
there are the breadcrumbs there with the little Xs on them.


00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.300
You could, you know,


00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.940
just maybe that one candidate across all time


00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.780
or all the money for 2022.


00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:51.180
And so it is, for all the data is,


00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.340
it is again, like about coming up on,


00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:59.340
we had around 500 million transactional transactions


00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.660
last in the 2020 election.


00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.300
That equals about four terabytes of data.


00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.180
And the expectation is it is filterable,


00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.620
it's searchable, it's exportable.


00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.700
I think user expectation is that you'll be able


00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.900
to get the information quickly.


00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.500
So we've spent a lot of time focusing


00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.940
on performance improvement for the site,


00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.000
which is powered by our campaign finance data API


00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.200
under the hood.


00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.060
- Nice.


00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.720
Yeah, there's a whole bunch of APIs


00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.480
and you can even check out the code on GitHub,


00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.300
which is super interesting.


00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.640
But yeah, this is the kind of data that people can get.


00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.920
And I think it's pretty good.


00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.380
So one of the thing that's interesting to me


00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.120
is if I'm over here on fec.gov,


00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.440
this looks like a pretty well-designed website.


00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.000
It looks nice.


00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.080
You can jump around.


00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.440
But then as you were showing me those different locations,


00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.320
it looks pretty data-driven.


00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.160
Like there's a decent amount of logic behind it.


00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.360
And you said that this is built on Wagtail, is that right?


00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.880
- So there are, when you go to fec.gov,


00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.160
it's mainly two applications.


00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.040
- Okay.


00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.120
- The content management system we use


00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.280
is built with Wagtail.


00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.600
So there are kind of three different buckets on the site.


00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.940
There's the campaign finance data,


00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.040
which we were just discussing.


00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:11.880
- Right.


00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.560
- Which is mostly powered by the API.


00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.400
We use some AJAX calls,


00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.440
just basically JavaScript and data tables


00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.480
to display the data that the API provides.


00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.120
And this application that we're looking at


00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.080
is the Django-based CMS application.


00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.640
- Right, and so for people who don't know,


00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.840
maybe just tell them really


00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.600
what's the elevator pitch on Wagtail, what is this thing?


00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.640
- Wagtail's a really great admin for the Django framework.


00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.320
So Django has a built-in admin framework that,


00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.520
so just to kind of give some context,


00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.080
the disclosure, the help for candidates


00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.800
and committees section of our site


00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.840
has information for our regulated community.


00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.000
So if they want to find out,


00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.740
can I take this money from this source


00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.660
or what are the limits on contributions?


00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.280
They can go to help for candidates and committees


00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.100
and find the answers to their questions.


00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.680
And so that's stored in the Django database.


00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.860
Well, it's stored in a Postgres database


00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.980
that our Django application connects to.


00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.700
And Django as a web application framework


00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.060
has a built-in admin.


00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.740
So if you've worked on like the Django tutorial


00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.900
or anything like that, you can go /admin


00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.900
and use the built-in Django admin to manage your content.


00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.940
So if you wanted to modify an article,


00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.740
or you're working on a blog or whatever,


00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.180
that's how you do it.


00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.780
Wagtail is an open source tool


00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:33.060
that has more user-friendly functionality


00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.380
on top of the existing Django admin.


00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.060
I don't work as close--


00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.660
- A little closer to like WordPress-ish kind of?


00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.820
- Yeah, it's got some great features.


00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.260
You can do custom templates.


00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.340
I work more on the data sides,


00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.980
but we have a content team that uses Wagtail


00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.020
to manage the content on the site.


00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.460
And it seems like it's very customizable


00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:58.140
and just has more features than the Django admin


00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.900
that I'm sure you could build yourself,


00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.220
but this is a free open source project


00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.100
that allows you to have a more robust admin interface.


00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.900
- Yeah, a lot of times that's a big


00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.220
platform decision people have to make.


00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.100
Like, oh, well, we wanna have this admin thing


00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.500
that people will let people go in


00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.120
and just so developers don't have to add


00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.460
the informational pages and just maintain


00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.460
the basic data of the site.


00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:27.400
So I could either build something in Django


00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.060
and then it's kind of on me or we gotta go


00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.500
through the admin back in in a clunky way


00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.060
or I've gotta build something or we go WordPress


00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.760
and then but now you're out of Python


00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.900
and you're in this other Joomla WordPress world


00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.460
that you're not really able to extend


00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.740
and it just becomes almost a static site.


00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.380
And so things like Wagtail are cool


00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.100
because they let you stay in your world


00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.180
if you're a Python developer,


00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.380
but then also have a nicer experience on top of it


00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.980
for the users.


00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.220
- Yeah, Wacom's been, seems like it's been great for us.


00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.660
- Yeah, very cool, very cool.


00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:01.540
Okay, so we've got that,


00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.320
and then we've also got the,


00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:10.900
what is it, the API, the OpenFEC API,


00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.880
is what I'm trying to say here,


00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.600
which is a RESTful API around all this data


00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.700
that we've been talking about, right?


00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.080
Tell us about this.


00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.560
- Sure, so if anyone hasn't worked with APIs before,


00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.140
the API is just the source


00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.000
for all the campaign finance data.


00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.960
So one of my friends put it a cute way,


00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.480
"We drink our own champagne."


00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.960
So any of the data you see on FEC.gov


00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.560
is coming from the API.


00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.800
So you don't need to know how to use an API.


00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.780
You never need to touch the API if you don't want to.


00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.200
You can go to FEC.gov and get all of the data


00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.080
that you want out of this.


00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:44.920
- That's really cool.


00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.720
I've heard the term dog food,


00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.200
eat your own dog food.


00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.640
Drinking your own champagne sounds way better.


00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.440
That means the same thing, right?


00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.600
- Way more pleasant, I imagine.


00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.640
- Okay, awesome.


00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.320
Yeah, so when we were interacting with the homepage,


00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.040
the all data section,


00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.340
that was JavaScript talking to this as well,


00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.080
just so you're basically the first client of this API.


00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.920
- Correct, exactly correct.


00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.080
So if, however, if the FEC web,


00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.280
fec.gov doesn't have the information you need


00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.280
or you wanna build your own tools on top of the API,


00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.680
we do make that available to you directly.


00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.320
So you can bypass fec.gov


00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.160
and go directly to the source to get the data.


00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.000
- How old is this API?


00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.520
How long has it been around?


00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.000
- So we realized around 2014


00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.960
that the legacy systems we were running


00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.840
were going to have a really big problem


00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.240
with our exponentially growing data.


00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.240
So in 2015, we partnered with 18F,


00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.700
which is a government organization within,


00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.560
it's kind of consulting for government by government.


00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.880
And we wanted to build an open source,


00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:58.700
cloud-based application that had an API.


00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.640
So we actually built,


00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.700
we launched the API before we launched FEC.gov.


00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.120
So it's been, we've been drinking our own champagne


00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.000
since around 2015.


00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.800
It's been a party for six years, awesome.


00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.520
So I've heard of 18F and it sounds like these are


00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.280
some really tech savvy folks that can drop in


00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.760
and help the other developers on other organizations


00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.640
or divisions in the government say,


00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.140
look, you wanna modernize what you're doing,


00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.120
let us come spend six months or a year


00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.720
and we'll help you get going and then hand it off to you.


00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.600
- I was hugely, hugely fortunate to have overlapped


00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.680
with 18F when I joined the project


00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.920
because I, again, joined the project,


00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.420
having done a crash course in learning Python,


00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.140
but not having had a lot of other skills


00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.960
that were needed to be successful in the project.


00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.520
So I was able to have really, really excellent mentors


00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.440
that helped me learn.


00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.480
If in a lot of government agencies,


00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.800
this was our first cloud-based application.


00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.400
So I think hopefully I'll get a chance


00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.800
to talk about cloud.gov, which is the platform that we're on.


00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.240
But this was all new to us.


00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.240
And so 18F was really wonderful.


00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.080
They taught us a lot.


00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.640
They taught us how to build software in an agile way,


00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.440
how to practice open source,


00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.440
and not just share your code, but work in the open.


00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.640
So if you go to our code repositories,


00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.240
you can see what I'm currently working on.


00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.220
All of our issues, all of our tickets are public,


00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.200
and you can see the priorities and how things are going.


00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.000
And, oh, there's my change,


00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.160
or I was tweaking our workers for a G event.


00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.780
And actually I'm thinking of moving


00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.880
to a different mechanism for our asynchronous requests


00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.500
and you can follow along with my research.


00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.500
And if you have opinions about workers versus threads


00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.100
for Gunicorn, I think, I don't know how,


00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.500
I call it Gunicorn. - I say Gunicorn,


00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.820
some people say Gunicorn.


00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.420
To me, I don't know, it's like a unicorn with a G.


00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.260
(laughing)


00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.180
- So if you have opinions on this,


00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.220
please chime in, all those issues are public.


00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.700
I've done some research on pros and cons


00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.900
of the different configuration.


00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.340
But yeah, 18.0 kind of led the way on how to work


00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.640
in an agile way, in an open way,


00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.160
and we were super lucky to be able to work with them.


00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.000
- Yeah, this is really neat.


00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.600
So I'm sitting here looking at github.com/fecgov/openfec.


00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.960
And this is the GitHub repository for the API, right?


00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.040
- Correct.


00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.280
- And it's not some forked off,


00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.840
like we'll dump to it every now and then,


00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.960
like you said, this is where you all work.


00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.760
- Yes, this is where we deploy from.


00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.000
When we have, we use CircleCI,


00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.660
they have a really great open source tier.


00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.700
So when we merged the develop branch,


00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.620
it deploys to cloud.gov and the develop space.


00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.540
So this is our source of truth.


00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.100
- Nice, and it looks like you're using


00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.460
sort of feature branch style PR development,


00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.500
which feels modern and fresh to me.


00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.540
Another thing that's interesting is if I come down here,


00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.260
we've got our requirements,


00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.020
requirements.json here, and we've got Flask,


00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.620
we've got Flask RESTful and Flask SQLAlchemy.


00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.260
I mean, this looks like a fun tech stack.


00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.700
- Thank you, yeah, I've enjoyed it.


00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.420
I gave a talk at FlaskCon,


00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.180
which I think was the first time they ran it,


00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.180
I guess about a year ago,


00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.300
that goes into a little bit more technical detail


00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.300
about how we use Flask for the API.


00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.220
- Yeah, yeah, super, super interesting.


00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.620
One thing I'm noticing here,


00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:23.300
there's Flask 1, 1.1.1, which is great.


00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.020
Last week, I guess last week, maybe five days ago,


00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.300
two came out.


00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.660
They also have new async plans going on.


00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.380
Are you all thinking about that already


00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.940
or are you just still putting out features for now?


00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.460
- With our data doubling every two years


00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.220
and we are down a couple of staff members,


00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.620
we're sort of in the hopefully hang on until next year


00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.900
and we'll get some more money plays.


00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.620
If it's not broken, we do have regular dependency checking


00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.900
for security issues.


00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.780
We do kind of, if there's an issue, we do update it.


00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:02.980
basically, we're not in the place to take that on quite yet.


00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:08.580
I did hear the news and I'm excited to see what that might help us accomplish.


00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.380
Yeah, absolutely.


00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:16.780
So, you've mentioned cloud.gov.


00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.780
I think that's a pretty interesting place.


00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.180
Actually, let's talk about a couple of other things.


00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:29.180
let's talk about this communities of practice at digital.gov.


00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.020
So you talked about working out in the open.


00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.860
So let's talk about some of the things going on there that I think are pretty interesting.


00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.300
But what's the story of these community of practices?


00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.020
So I'm here, I can see that there's like an AI section,


00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.820
and there's a blockchain section, and then cloud and infrastructure,


00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.260
which is getting close to cloud.gov stories and DevOps.


00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.060
What is this place?


00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:52.700
Yeah, so one of the things that surprised me about coming to government is how...


00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:57.660
So FEC is an independent regulatory agency which means it's not part of one of the big


00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:04.540
cabinet agencies and so it kind of surprised me. We're all sort of doing similar things and we sort


00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.700
of struggle to talk to each other about you know what's working, what's not working. It's not always


00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:15.740
clear who you might talk to just at other agencies about ideas and suggestions they have. We're pretty


00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.660
small potatoes compared to a lot of the bigger agencies and we have a lot to learn from them but


00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:26.140
I don't know how I'd feel about just sort of cold emailing someone I've stalked on LinkedIn or something like that.


00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:31.780
It can be hard to connect to other people working on very similar problems.


00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.540
So...


00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:39.260
Because you could hear that maybe the people in, I don't know, IRS or something, they're doing something cool,


00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.340
and you would, because it's kind of related to what you're doing in some sense,


00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.100
it'd be neat to see how that might work for you all.


00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.260
But you don't know those people, right?


00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:53.940
the government is huge and it's like a hundred thousand, I'm sure more than that, a huge huge


00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:58.260
company that many people have never met, they're not close to each other, right? So this is a way


00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:03.460
to set up some of those communities around ideas, is that right? Absolutely, yeah, it's really


00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:09.460
wonderful and we've talked to people at the CFPB, they use, I know they use Wagtail and we've sort


00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:14.900
of traded ideas about what's working well and what's some of the challenges we're facing,


00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:19.060
But the communities of practice are kind of a formal way of bringing people together.


00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.700
And I've really enjoyed the DevOps community of practice.


00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.060
And they have a monthly short half hour tech talk,


00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:29.780
where they invite people to talk about the types of things they're working on,


00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.100
and successes and challenges.


00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.380
Yeah, super neat.


00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.780
Then another one was this digital services playbook.


00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.140
So I think, you know, the digital services is something I just learned about


00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.260
a little while ago, a couple years ago, I think.


00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.940
I think I had, oh gosh, I'm sorry,


00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.380
I don't remember the guest's name,


00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.380
but I had one of the developers on


00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.620
from the US Digital Service,


00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.880
which I thought was a really interesting,


00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.940
just a really interesting organization


00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.900
that I hadn't heard about.


00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.760
Maybe tell people what that is real quick,


00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.760
and then what is this digital services playbook?


00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.140
I think this seems pretty neat.


00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.940
- Sure, so I'm not affiliated


00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.700
with the US Digital Service in any way.


00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.260
However, I have met people who work there


00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.780
and I've always been super impressed by them,


00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.940
and they have a similar mission to 18F.


00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.700
And there are people out there who have written blog posts


00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.540
about the difference,


00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.660
but they're through the executive office of the president.


00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:18.860
And they do have a similar mission


00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.460
of helping modernize government technologies.


00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.060
I think one of the biggest challenges


00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.820
in everyone I've ever spoken to


00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.820
who works in government is contracting.


00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.420
So if you're lucky enough to have staff,


00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.820
federal employees,


00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:37.820
you can have some more flexibility around how you do the work.


00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.740
But if you are,


00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.060
there are some advantages and disadvantages to contracting,


00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.640
but it can be very difficult to get right.


00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:50.320
And so one of the resources I often point my acquaintances


00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.040
towards that are trying to modernize their technology


00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.560
is the US Digital Services Playbook.


00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.920
And it goes through how to approach


00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.960
your modernizing your technology.


00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.640
It talks about best practices for contracting


00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.360
and kind of gives you a roadmap.


00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.240
And I think there's another resource


00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.860
I'd like to touch on in a second.


00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.220
There's a statistic that I think like 80%


00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.040
of all custom built software projects in government fail.


00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.220
And I think that contracting


00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.280
is a really hard thing to get right.


00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.260
It's sort of like, I imagine outsourcing


00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.200
for the private sector.


00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.200
It has risks to outsource because it just has trade-offs.


00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.240
And the amount of management and oversight


00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.800
you might need to have for a contractor


00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.360
or outsourced project might differ from if it's in-house.


00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.400
So this is a really great,


00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.180
the digital services playbook is a really great resource


00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.060
for other federal employees


00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.560
or people working on federal projects.


00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.280
And then also just anyone looking to modernize


00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.480
their systems might find this is helpful as well.


00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.000
- Yeah, and they've got 13,


00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.760
apparently they're not superstitious, which is cool.


00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.480
So they've got 13 digital service plays.


00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.360
So things like that are pretty, I guess, pretty standard,


00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.240
but also good, you know, like understand what people need,


00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.600
make it simple and intuitive,


00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.900
but then stuff that maybe people within government


00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.160
don't necessarily, they wouldn't necessarily think about,


00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.960
like default to open,


00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.520
or, you know, choose a modern technology stack


00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.440
and things like that, you know,


00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.480
default to open, for example, right?


00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.720
You might think, well, this is data about people


00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.680
and it's super sensitive.


00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.480
That's one reason to keep it hidden.


00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.760
I mean, obviously what you're giving away


00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.240
is supposed to be public at FTC.


00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.700
And then another is, for example,


00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.840
if you share your source code,


00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.320
maybe people who want to do bad things with it


00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.800
will come and use that to find some way to,


00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.080
I don't know, do something that they shouldn't, right?


00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.480
But we've seen a lot of security in open source as well,


00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.640
right?


00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.480
- Absolutely. - By having


00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.760
multiple eyes on it.


00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.680
- Absolutely, and I think building in the open


00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.400
from the beginning is the best way


00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.280
to successfully have an open source project


00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.280
because retroactively open sourcing that has been built


00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.880
using the assumption that you'll have protection


00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.920
through obfuscation can be really risky.


00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.440
And unfortunately, if you're building


00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.280
a closed source system, it can make it a little easier


00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.280
to have some bad practices like hard coding credentials.


00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.880
I think there can be some misunderstandings


00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.960
about how open source works.


00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.120
Like no one can come in and just change the code


00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.040
for FEC.gov, they need to submit a request,


00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.000
which is reviewed by one of our team members


00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.840
and gone through a security review as part of that process.


00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.400
So it kind of, open source sort of encourages best practices


00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.120
because you might think that you're,


00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.440
you have the strongest network security that ever exists.


00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.000
And, but if someone can't,


00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.400
phishing is I think one of the biggest weaknesses


00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.600
that organizations face.


00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.480
And so I think, I think that's sometimes called


00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.760
zero trust, we're just assume they're gonna get


00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.840
to the code either way.


00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.320
So you might as well use best practices


00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.500
for securing your code.


00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.240
And the best way to do that is from the very beginning,


00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.320
assume that you're gonna have eyes on it.


00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.060
- Yeah, cool.


00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.960
Now, before we move off this digital services,


00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.440
Kim out there live stream says,


00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.160
"David Holmes was your guest."


00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.260
Thank you, Kim, for that.


00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.680
Yes, I remember that now.


00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:33.680
And it says, as a non-US citizen, he's from South Africa,


00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.920
do organizations like the FEC use the US digital services


00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.540
or is it all in-house?


00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.580
It sounds like you kind of are separate from them.


00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.540
- We partnered with 18F back in 2015.


00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.860
And again, they're sort of like consulting


00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.740
for government by government.


00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:54.740
They rolled off, 18F rolled off our project in 2018-ish.


00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.880
And we haven't partnered with the US Digital Service.


00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.040
I think they choose their projects


00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.540
that can be influenced by the Executive Office


00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.540
of the President.


00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.680
So we haven't worked with them, but I've met,


00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.840
we do have an exchange of ideas.


00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.600
If we're lucky to go to PyCon, for example,


00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.800
and meet other people who work there,


00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.920
we can talk about what's working well.


00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.460
And so that is super valuable to be able to have


00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.280
that sort of relationship with them.


00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.840
- Yeah, fantastic.


00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.760
One other resource that I think you were hinting at


00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:30.120
is this de-risking guide from 18F, is that right?


00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.800
- Yes, I'm a huge fan of this.


00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.300
They have a federal and non-federal version.


00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.840
So if you're a state,


00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.280
that's a whole nother thing in the US


00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.100
that we have to deal with


00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.040
where we have the federal government


00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.400
and the state government.


00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.020
And just like all the federal agencies are out there


00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.640
replicating similar efforts,


00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.540
all the states are replicating similar efforts


00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.480
with their own budgets and their own challenges.


00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.600
And in some ways, if we're looking at things like security,


00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:59.040
we have a disadvantage because we're splitting up our resources into many slices.


00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:05.120
So I love that 18F also built a non-federal guide to help with the state and local governments


00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.120
as well.


00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.840
Yeah, there's a, I think this also applies to large organizations that have maybe been


00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:18.320
around a while, but here's a stat from government says, "Only 13% of large government IT projects


00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:25.360
succeed and implementing custom software projects can be extraordinarily costly and risky in a


00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.680
government setting and here's the big thing, the waterfall software development remains the


00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:36.080
standard at all levels. So in budgeting, in management, in rollout, all those things which is


00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:43.600
very different from here's my PR let's push that with CI to cloud.gov right? Yeah absolutely,


00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.360
I feel like someone said recently,


00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.840
government contracting is really designed to buy tanks


00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.120
and building software, you know,


00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.640
isn't really very, doesn't have a lot in common


00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.920
with buying a tank.


00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.920
And so, yes, it's difficult to get right.


00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.900
And this guide has some really practical recommendations


00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.040
for how to manage the process.


00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.960
And one of my biggest things I'd like to highlight


00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.880
is the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan or QASP.


00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.780
that's mentioned in this guide,


00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:19.440
you can build it into your contract as a way to measure


00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.940
whether the quality of the software is acceptable.


00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.760
And it can help you as the person


00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.860
who's managing the contract


00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.420
and help your contractors understand


00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.520
what acceptable levels of quality are.


00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.720
So, oh, it looks like the Quasp is highlighted there


00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.920
at the top and one of the menus.


00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.760
- There you go.


00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.800
- And they have a sample Quasp, which is really cool.


00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.360
And so if you scroll down a little bit there on this page,


00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.360
you can see some example quality measurement ideas.


00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:54.680
So using an automated tool to check for accessibility


00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.600
and security vulnerabilities,


00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.120
you should be able to deploy with a single command


00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.520
following OWASP best practices.


00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.840
There are tools that can be used


00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.560
to check for vulnerabilities,


00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.680
doing user research at every sprint.


00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.600
These are just really great recommendations.


00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.560
- Oh yeah, how neat.


00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.120
And there's a little, how do you do this measurement


00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.440
of like what is the acceptable quality level?


00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.280
How do you measure it?


00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.520
And so on, this is really neat.


00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.040
I like it.


00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.440
- Huge, I'm a huge fan.


00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.280
- Yeah, cool.


00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.600
Now let me pull up one thing


00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.000
that I thought was pretty interesting here.


00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.880
And I'm seeing this, excuse me.


00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.960
I'm seeing this all over the different sites


00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.560
where I'm seeing it on the fec.gov and so on.


00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.720
If I click here, it says right at the top,


00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.360
an official website of the US government.


00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.180
How do you know?


00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.080
And it says, well, it's a.gov.


00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.560
And then it talks about this little lock.


00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.320
And if I look at the lock,


00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.000
it says this is all done through Let's Encrypt,


00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.400
which Let's Encrypt is awesome.


00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.960
You know, it's a way to basically automate


00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.920
getting SSL certificates,


00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.760
but it feels like very modern and cool and hip.


00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.340
and to see the government rolling that out,


00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.320
that was kind of a surprise.


00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.760
And I feel like this ties a little bit back


00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.100
to our next topic, which is cloud.gov.


00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.640
- Absolutely, yes.


00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:19.560
The first thing I wanna point out is the banner


00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.920
you mentioned at the top of the page


00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.000
is part of the US Web Development Standards,


00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.680
US Web Development Design System.


00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:32.520
And they have a, it's an initiative to bring the look


00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.400
and feel of government websites in line with each other.


00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.600
so it can help build trust and users can be assured


00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.840
that they are in the right place.


00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.600
So if this is the first time you've heard of it,


00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.520
they have some really great resources,


00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.640
USWDS, and I might be getting the acronym,


00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.200
like what it stands for slightly wrong,


00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.400
but they have components you can use on your site,


00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:00.400
it's all open source, web design system.


00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.440
- There you go. - Thank you.


00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.000
And so you can see on their website,


00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.700
They have an official website of the US government.


00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.000
Here's how you know at the top of their page, just like we do.


00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.240
- They even have versioning, like version 2.11.2.


00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.100
- Yeah, this is a really great resource as well.


00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:16.940
It's all open source.


00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.280
So even if you aren't in government,


00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.160
if you wanted to borrow any design, it's a design system.


00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.400
And people who know more about design systems


00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.860
would know more about what that means.


00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.020
But we do use parts of that in our site.


00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.120
But you mentioned Let's Encrypt


00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:36.280
as part of how we manage our certificates.


00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.400
FEC.gov is run on cloud.gov,


00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.880
and cloud.gov is a platform as a service


00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:45.480
that's available to government agencies.


00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.680
And so when you build a cloud-based system,


00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.920
you have the option of building your own cloud infrastructure


00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.920
in AWS or Azure, Google Cloud from scratch,


00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.840
or you could use a platform as a service.


00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.960
And there are pros and cons, trade-offs,


00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.880
of each approach.


00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.660
But we find as a small agency,


00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:09.000
cloud misconfiguration is one of the leading causes


00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.440
of security breaches.


00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.280
And--


00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.840
- Yeah, how often do we hear about,


00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.000
here is a server running in the cloud


00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.440
without authentication,


00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.120
or here is 10 million records of some sensitive data


00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.440
in a non-secured public S3 bucket


00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.440
because it was a pain to deal with security,


00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.200
to integrate that with the app or whatever, right?


00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.040
These are real problems.


00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.720
- Absolutely, and the cloud itself is very secure,


00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.520
but you need to make sure you're configuring it properly


00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.440
to take advantage of those security features.


00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.760
And so that's not easy to do,


00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.120
or I haven't found it easy to do.


00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.020
I would say like they give you enough,


00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.120
well, I probably won't use that phrase, phraseology,


00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:56.120
but it's very powerful and difficult to get right.


00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.280
And if you do--


00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.600
- Yeah, I feel like AWS and Azure, those types of places,


00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.480
they're very powerful, but you go there and it's just,


00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.280
you know, deer in the headlights, so many choices,


00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.920
just even at the, what area do you want to go into?


00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.080
And then you factor, well, what are the security


00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.120
implications of changing this switch down in some level?


00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.020
It's crazy, yeah.


00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.880
- Yeah, I won't even sign up for a free tier account


00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.120
'cause I'm convinced knowing me,


00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.880
someone's gonna get access and mine Bitcoin,


00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.000
I'm gonna have a $10,000.


00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.720
Like they make you put your credit card in there


00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.560
and I'm not doing it.


00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.120
- Yeah, yeah, like, nope.


00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:33.800
So it takes a lot of expertise to build your own infrastructure in the cloud in a secure way.


00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:43.240
And our agency being smaller, we could go ahead and do that, but cloud.gov has a lot of advantages.


00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:48.440
And so what it does is it sits on top of AWS as a management layer.


00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:54.760
And so it manages cloud security, it manages authentication, you know, who has access to what.


00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.480
It makes it super easy to deploy,


00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.720
really easy to keep our infrastructure as code.


00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.120
You can use infrastructure as code in AWS,


00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.960
but I still haven't really figured out how to do that.


00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.360
It seems, well, again, so many,


00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:10.600
I haven't, I find it, no matter how many trainings I take,


00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.000
I still find it difficult to work with.


00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.240
So cloud.gov has a lot of advantages


00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.840
over building your own infrastructure.


00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.360
It has fixed pricing, again, like if you mess something up


00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.520
and are running a machine for too long, and


00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:30.680
you get a surprise $10,000 bill, that doesn't happen in cloud.gov because they have cost engineers and they have fixed pricing.


00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:36.040
In government, if you want to build a technical system, you have to have an,


00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.640
it's called an ATO, an authority to operate.


00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.040
It's all this paperwork that you need to do in order to prove that your system is secure enough.


00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:51.000
And by using cloud.gov, you can inherit from their ATO and kind of save yourself a lot of paperwork.


00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.680
And so, you just put the checkbox. I'm using cloud.gov.


00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:00.840
Essentially, they, I mean, you mentioned we use let's encrypt. And my first reaction was cool.


00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:19.440
They manage a lot for us. They make it super easy to deploy. We have scalability through cloud.gov. And we can focus more of our time and energy on the data and application side of development, which in and of itself is pretty time consuming for us.


00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:19.980
Yeah.


00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.780
So maybe you could talk about two things.


00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.560
Maybe you could talk about some of the,


00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.060
what does your deployment look like?


00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.540
So I saw that you are using,


00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.860
I think you're using AWS at the moment, is that right?


00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:38.900
And then you're using Postgres.


00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.340
Maybe just talk about how you're running all that,


00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.220
the APIs and stuff out there.


00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.380
- Sure, so application architecture,


00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.940
we run our application tier on cloud.gov


00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:52.220
And our database tier is actually,


00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:57.220
we have our own managed AWS Aurora Postgres that we run


00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:00.220
because while cloud.gov does offer database services,


00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.500
our database is so massive that we wanted,


00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.020
and we have really experienced DBAs


00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.620
who wanted more granular control


00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.940
over the settings on the database.


00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.340
- You talked about how you were in a place where


00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:14.060
if you wanted to scale horizontally


00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.420
by adding more read servers, read replicas,


00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.060
That was a redeploy for app and a big challenge


00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.380
and moving to Aurora made that


00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.260
sort of automatic behind the scenes, right?


00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.800
- Yes, I did and I can probably put this in the show notes.


00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.980
I did a talk on how we use Aurora


00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.500
for database scalability.


00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:37.500
So AWS, RDS, Postgres,


00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.920
just kind of plain,


00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.740
I think it's like relational database service,


00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.660
basically managed database service.


00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:45.900
When you have read replicas,


00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.980
So at some points we'll run,


00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:52.140
we need to run like three to four read replicas equivalent.


00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.500
So we can go into like the difference there,


00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:56.580
but we need to run on numerous machines at the same time


00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.020
on the database side in order to meet our demand.


00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:02.860
- I suspect that this data is very read heavy


00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.220
the way it's being used.


00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.460
- Well, it is very read heavy,


00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.300
but we also have the data's always changing.


00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.180
So we have some really big filers.


00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.020
- That's true.


00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.820
If you're during like a big campaign,


00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:18.700
people are every little contribution is streaming in, right?


00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.980
- Yep, and there's some big packs


00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.660
that'll have like 30 million records,


00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.340
40 million records we need to insert all in one night.


00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.980
So we do have a lot of, it's pretty insert heavy as well.


00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:32.860
But in the past, when you use AWS RDS,


00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.500
each read replica had its own connection string.


00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.740
So we are using the 12 factor framework


00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:41.100
for application development,


00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.500
which is, that's published online


00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:49.220
basically considered best practices for cloud-based application development.


00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:53.540
And it recommends using your attached services,


00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.700
connecting to them through connection strings.


00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.620
So basically, you should be able to swap out your database for...


00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.460
One database should be able to swap out to another.


00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.540
So this is backing services number four there.


00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.460
Treat backing services as attached resources.


00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.340
So our application connects to the database


00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:12.660
through an environment variable connection string.


00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.080
And when we were using plain RDS before,


00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.420
each replica had its own connection string.


00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.080
So in order to scale,


00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.580
we could have set up auto scaling on that database side,


00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.460
but we would have had to come up with a fairly fancy way


00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.920
of consuming that new connection string,


00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.080
adding it to the environment variable, the application,


00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.420
and then redeploying the application


00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.160
to reflect that new connection string.


00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.920
So basically it wasn't functionally,


00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.660
it wasn't very feasible to us


00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.660
for us to have database auto scaling.


00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.740
And after doing some research,


00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:48.540
we decided to move to AWS Aurora Postgres,


00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.580
which has one connection string that you connect to,


00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:55.380
and it handles auto scaling on its end.


00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.860
So it doesn't call them replicas,


00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.580
it calls them instances,


00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.940
but they're functionally replicas.


00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:04.500
So we connect to one connection string


00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.140
and it could have two instances running,


00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.260
and then if it has high CPU,


00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.140
it'll spin up some more machines to handle the database side.


00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:13.260
- Oh, cool. So you can set up like auto-scaling rules


00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.940
and things along those lines?


00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:15.780
- Yes.


00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.740
- Mm-hmm. Okay.


00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.860
- So that's the machine under the hood for the API.


00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:24.100
- Yeah. And Doreen, one of your talks,


00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.940
was that presentation that I linked to,


00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:29.620
was that one given to the community of practice group?


00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:30.660
Is that where that was?


00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.500
- It is, yes.


00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.780
- Oh, it's all coming together, I see.


00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.260
So I'll link to that as well.


00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:38.420
but during that talk, you showed some neat CLIs


00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:41.620
for deployment and configuring scale and things like that.


00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:42.820
And it was really cool.


00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:43.660
You go over there and say,


00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:46.300
"Hey, I just want five more web front ends."


00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.100
Boom, and you have them, right?


00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.540
That was quite neat how that works.


00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:54.020
- Yeah, cloud.gov is based off of Cloud Foundry,


00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:59.020
which is an open source platform management tool.


00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:04.460
And so I think it can be a little bit difficult


00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:07.780
to run this on your own, but there are managed services


00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:09.220
that run Cloud Foundry.


00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.900
And one of the big ideas, as I understand it,


00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.660
behind Cloud Foundry is making the developer experience


00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:15.700
really easy.


00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.660
So you can deploy with a single command, cf push.


00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:22.340
So we use on cloud.gov all the Cloud Foundry commands.


00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.860
And with one command, you can scale up


00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:30.100
the number of instances you're running of your application.


00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.260
And it's practically immediate.


00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.100
I mean, I would say like under three seconds


00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.260
to quadruple your machine number.


00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.380
- You made an interesting comparison to that


00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.700
about the previous model with physical servers.


00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.820
- Yeah, so our legacy system was run on physical servers


00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.020
and it was really difficult to predict


00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.420
how much we were going to need.


00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.660
We'd sometimes we'd overbuy, sometimes we'd underbuy.


00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:56.780
It could take three months to get a new server set up


00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.860
and now it takes three seconds to get a new instance running.


00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.420
In addition, when we moved to cloud.gov,


00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:06.340
we saved about $1.2 million a year in infrastructure costs,


00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.620
which was really big for us as a small agency.


00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:09.560
- That's a huge thing.


00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.140
And I believe one of the numbers you threw out there


00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.380
previously is 1.4 million


00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.180
was around the infrastructure costs before.


00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:20.620
So to go from 1.4 to 200,000, that's a huge difference.


00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.340
It's not like, well, it's a hundred million


00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.660
and it went to 99 million.


00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.300
It was much, much better, right?


00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.860
- Percentage-wise, that's a great point.


00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.180
Yeah, and we were able to, again, like my big,


00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:34.380
the thing I love about cloud.gov is not taking on that risk ourselves,


00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:40.020
both the security risk and also just the risk of misconfiguring something


00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.260
and something going down.


00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:45.940
For a small agency like ours, it's really huge to be able to depend on.


00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:51.100
Yeah, you don't have to have a team of network and DevOps engineers


00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:53.220
just to keep it going, I suspect.


00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.820
Like that's the cloud.gov side and they just deal with it.


00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:02.220
Yeah, I think when I talked to them, if we had taken all of this in-house, the amount of services that they offer,


00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.980
we would have needed to hire like six or seven more people and we have a team of nine.


00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:13.500
So it was just not cost effective for us to bring that infrastructure in-house at this time.


00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:17.740
All right, so let me ask you a question. I've been thinking about this as we've been talking about all these things,


00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:23.660
seeing all the cool stuff that you're doing, seeing how 18F came in and helped and all of those.


00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.660
Now, I don't necessarily expect to have an answer to this,


00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.700
but I just want to hear your thoughts.


00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:32.300
So the rollout of the Affordable Care Act


00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:35.260
and all of the drama around the websites


00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.980
and the challenges of scaling that and stuff,


00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.140
do you think it would be different?


00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.540
Do you think it would be smoother


00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:45.100
if like this world existed in a more polished way?


00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.660
And we tried to roll it out again in the same way?


00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.420
- I think that there are a lot of challenges


00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:55.740
in delivering digital services.


00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:58.660
I think a lot of the expectations


00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:02.100
for digital service delivery are high.


00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:04.500
It's like, well, Google can find this for me.


00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.580
And if you compare the operating budget


00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.880
between my agency and Google, it's like, ooh.


00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.180
- Google just talked about rolling out


00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.140
their own supercomputer for this other thing.


00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:17.140
That's like a different set of capabilities.


00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:18.020
- Totally, totally.


00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:20.420
I would say, to me, it all boils down


00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.420
to as boring as it sounds, it boils down to contracting.


00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:26.020
It really depends on how the contract is written


00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:26.980
and how it's managed.


00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.900
And I don't know very much about it,


00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.340
but I do know that if you don't get it right,


00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.340
it's very difficult to course correct.


00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:37.060
So absolutely, we can do better,


00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.060
but there are still a lot of challenges


00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:44.060
to preventing those sorts of issues.


00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.220
- Okay, cool, cool.


00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:49.220
All right, well, I think that's probably all the time


00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:50.820
we have to dive deep in this.


00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:52.340
But this has been a super interesting look


00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.060
at what's happening over there.


00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.820
And, you know, honestly, it's heartening to see


00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.920
how much the government is advancing and using modern tech


00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.700
and really putting these systems in place.


00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.380
So well done.


00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.220
- Thank you so much.


00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.660
It was a pleasure to speak with you today.


00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.500
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.


00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.400
Now, before you get out of here,


00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.380
I got the two final questions.


00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:14.020
So if you're gonna work on the API, for example,


00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.580
write some Flask and Python code,


00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.480
what editor do you use?


00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:23.000
I use Sublime and VS Code does package management better,


00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.360
I think, but I just can't make myself move.


00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:30.120
- And notable PyPI package,


00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.080
maybe something cool that you used during the project


00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.960
that you're like, oh, people should really know about this.


00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.440
It doesn't get enough press.


00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.440
- Sure, I'm a maintainer for Flask SQLAlchemy.


00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.400
So it's a really great package.


00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.560
Community has been super welcoming.


00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.120
It's the only one I've been able to really get my hands on.


00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.400
So if you're looking for a project to work on,


00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.720
all the Flask projects are great to contribute to.


00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.600
- Yeah, oh, fantastic.


00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.800
Tell people real quick,


00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:59.440
why would you choose Flask SQLAlchemy over just SQLAlchemy?


00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.880
- I think it depends on getting started.


00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.080
I think it's pretty friendly to get started


00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.680
and you can maybe start with that


00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.880
and then reevaluate what sort of custom settings


00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.720
you might need.


00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.720
- Yeah, cool.


00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.960
All right.


00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.960
A couple of comments from the live stream.


00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.960
Antonio says, "No, don't go."


00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.960
He must have really enjoyed the chat.


00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.960
And then Brandon says, "Super interesting subject."


00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.960
Thank you. Yeah, thanks both for being here.


00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.960
Final call to action, you know, people broadly


00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.960
or maybe even people within governments around the world


00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:37.960
who want to do better, work with modern tech stack,


00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.960
you know, what do you tell them?


00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.960
Check out FEC.gov. The link to our GitHub is in the footer.


00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.960
We look-- all the feedback is public.


00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:50.260
anything you can get out of our open source project,


00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.900
take a look at who's running for office


00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:55.860
and we'd just love it if you got involved in our project.


00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.180
- Yeah, very cool.


00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:00.200
Well, like I said, well done, very nice work.


00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.340
It seems like when I was working with the site,


00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.460
it was super snappy and beautiful and polished.


00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:06.660
So excellent.


00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:07.920
- I'll pass it along to my team.


00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.940
Thanks so much.


00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:09.780
- Yeah, you bet.


00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:10.740
Thanks. - Okay, bye.


00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:20.740
