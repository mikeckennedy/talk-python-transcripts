WEBVTT

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.580
Hello, everyone. Ines, Gina, Richard, and Calvin. Welcome back to the show, all of you.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.360
It's great to have you all here.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.860
Yay! Yay, hi.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.180
Yeah, really, really good to have you all here. It's been fun to have you all on separately

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.880
for different shows. Although, Gina, you've definitely been on a few panel shows before

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.620
recently on, I think the last movie was our Mastodon one, right? We talked about that.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.720
Yeah.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.020
That was a

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.300
lot of fun.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.780
Today, we're going to talk about developer trends in a general sense.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.700
And I invited you all because I, like all of you,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.320
really appreciate having you here.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.860
And thanks for taking the time to be here.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.280
But you all also kind of work in little bits of different spaces

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.600
of technology and interests and so on.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.720
So I think we'll get a really nice, diverse perspective

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.860
of experiences and so on.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.080
I think the AI section is going to be especially interesting, as we'll see.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.280
Where are we going with that?

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.140
That's always interesting.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.880
So what we're going to do is we're going to use the 2024 Stack Overflow developer survey results.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.380
It's a little bit old, but it's less than a year old.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.900
I think it's close enough to use as a skeleton to kind of make that conversation happen.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.780
So it's going to be a ton of fun to just have a wide-ranging exploration of how people are learning technology, using technology.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.500
which ones are you using, so on. Before that, though, let's just do a quick round of introductions,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.240
and we'll go around the Brady Bunch squares in order, I suppose. So, Ines, you're on top left.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.240
Welcome. Great to see you.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.820
Yeah, nice to be back. Yeah, I'm Ines. I'm the co-founder of Explosion.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.659
We're probably mostly, well, most well known for spaCy, which is an open source library

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.640
for natural language processing in Python.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.360
So everything to do with text, AI,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.200
I do a lot in the open source space

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.700
and also helping developers build their own AI models

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.060
in-house, taking back control, that sort of stuff.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.940
So yeah, very curious.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.060
Like it was quite hard not to look at the results beforehand,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.340
but I did it.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.400
Thank you.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.579
Yeah, and we recently talked about open source

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.960
and LLMs and AI and stuff.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.580
And we'll open source

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.960
or the big cloud companies dominate that.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.060
That was a lot of fun to talk about.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.520
Yeah, the AI revolution won't be monopolized.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.380
Yes, exactly.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.760
That

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.080
was great.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.980
Gina, hello, welcome.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.240
Hi, yeah, my name is Gina.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.580
I'm also known as Fuzel

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.340
and my claim to fame is probably Octoprint,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.720
which is the snappy web interface

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.200
for your 3D printer,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.060
which is actually written in Python,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.500
which in turn is probably why I am here.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.400
yeah and I'm also

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.540
happen to be a full time maintainer working

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.760
on that project and have been

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.700
doing that now for well over 12

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.120
years so yeah

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.820
it's a weird life but it works somehow

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.840
it's got an

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.720
amazing life I mean I'm sure a lot of people

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.580
are seeing that as the dream right you created

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.820
an open source project and it's successful

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.760
enough that you can do that full

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.460
time that's

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.100
the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.360
dream

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.840
the people who are now listening to this

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.460
instead of watching that, will not see it when I point to my head, though,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.540
and show all the gray hair that is up on there.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.200
That wasn't there when I started this.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.420
So just pointing that out.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.220
There are

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.600
downsides to this film, certainly.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.400
Just correlation, not necessarily the same, right?

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.840
It's got things up,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.420
I'm sure.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.160
Yeah,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.000
I know where that goes.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.860
Hey,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.080
Richard,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.860
good to see you.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.060
Good to see you, too, friend.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.040
Richard Campbell, I make the podcast.NET Rocks, Run Eyes Radio,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.460
and now part of Windows Weekly as well.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.060
I'm supposed to be a half-ready, you know,.NET person,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.920
but as GitHub loves to remind me,

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.500
write entirely too much Python.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.720
And

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.220
YAML.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.980
Why do I write so much YAML?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.580
I don't know.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.400
Anyway.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.940
What kind of life choices have

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.180
you made?

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.080
I don't.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.700
You know what?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.500
I munge a lot of data these days.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.180
I don't know if

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.800
you know this,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.860
but Python's pretty good at that.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.840
Yeah.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.400
You know, my Jupyter Notebooks

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.099
open most of the time

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.000
because there's

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.100
always some chunk of data I need to rip through.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.380
There's some surprisingly good tools.

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.480
I was just talking with Reuben Lerner about Panda stuff.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.040
What you can do in a couple lines of code is ridiculous.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.040
MapReduce used to be

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.580
this huge task

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.160
where I harnessed multiple machines

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.740
to try and actually crush a large amount of data

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.600
in a reasonable length of time.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.920
A contemporary PC is really

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.360
good

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.900
at it.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.260
Stuff has changed.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.980
It's only getting easier.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.940
Use the tools du jour.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.280
and you'll find you'll get good results in less time.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.300
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.960
Yeah, you have a bunch of great podcasts.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.580
People, those sounds interesting too.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.980
And whenever I

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.620
get to talk to you,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.340
it's usually one of the geek outs, right?

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.760
Like that's where you end up.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.020
Yeah, yeah, we've done some great geek outs,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.080
some life in the solar system and energy talks and so

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.180
on.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.520
The nuclear power topic these days has been really huge

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.800
because everybody's talking about it

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.380
and it turns out I did a bunch of stuff on that back when it was cool

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.700
and

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.380
so people keep

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.200
asking me to do more.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.020
Yeah, that's very, very neat.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.220
Calvin, hello, hello.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.760
Good to see you.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.140
Good to see you too, Michael.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.620
I'm Calvin Hendryx-Parker.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.880
I'm CTO and co-founder of Six Feet Up,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.820
where we are a Python and AI for good organization.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.680
My lifelong Pythonista,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.040
I chose Python back in the year 2000

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.760
and decided I never wanted to look back.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.260
And so I made a company around

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.960
building cool Python stuff for other folks.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.000
So I guess that's kind of my claim to fame.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.020
This year will be my 21st PyCon.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.420
So my PyCon attendance can now drink.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.020
oh and boy let me tell you if you ever hung out with calvin at pycon

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.840
no

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.680
i'm just we well i would just say we always have the best parties together and some of the

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.620
highlights are all the get togethers that we do that's what i'm getting at here

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.220
yeah getting the

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.160
people together that's what's important yeah you should

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.199
all come to europe um hycon de is uh later

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.180
this month. I'm very excited. It's going to

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.300
be

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.800
really cooler than ever.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.540
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.080
But I

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.380
think the PyCon

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.920
and PyCon Italy

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.140
is also very good. PyData, Amsterdam.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.080
I don't want to single out

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.940
too many individual conferences, but you should

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.040
come to Germany.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.420
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.380
Sounds

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.800
like events

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.020
you need to bring your stunt liver

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.540
to, though.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.140
Yeah.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.520
Calvin, I definitely think

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.180
you definitely have been hosting

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.060
some of the great parties, the after parties and stuff at PyCon.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.500
I love the community.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.120
That's probably why I'm here is because I'm definitely a community first type person.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.860
Yeah, beautiful.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.640
All right, well, with that, let's just go ahead and jump right in to the topics here.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.640
So like I said, what we're going to do is we're going to go through the Stack Overflow

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.880
survey and just kind of use it as something to riff off of.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.900
So the first portion of Stack Overflow, of course, I'll put the link in the show notes.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.000
You can check it out and follow along.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.200
It had 65,000 people participate.

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:13.300
That's a lot of people.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:19.280
I don't feel like Stack Overflow almost could have gotten more, but that's still statistically pretty significant.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:27.160
And Stack Overflow, I think it's pretty broad across all the technologies these days.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.300
So I think Python is still the number one language on Stack Overflow.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.920
If we were to check

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.720
out Stack Overflow.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.520
Yeah, Stack Overflow trends.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.720
If we look at...

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.120
I mean, some might argue that's because Python is the number one language for developers in general.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:53.400
Well, I'm just saying that I think the results will be pretty significant,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.680
include a significant amount of Python feedback,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.420
not just overall, for better and worse.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.340
Yeah, so right now, if you look at it,

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.700
we've got Python at the number one,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.560
and we've got JS as number two.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.080
But boy, oh boy, there's a really precipitous drop in 2023,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.320
and we'll come back to that.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.460
That's going to be super interesting.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.960
But that's section three of our conversation right there.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.960
So the first thing that comes up here is education.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.440
How much education have you had as a person who works here?

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.539
And then I think maybe it's probably most relevant to focus in on the professional developers.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.900
They break out all respondents versus students versus professionals and so on.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.840
So let's maybe let's do a quick around here.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.360
How much programming did you all learn in school versus how much did you teach yourself?

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:50.560
None.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.240
None.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:52.620
Okay.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.660
I didn't

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.120
go into

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.360
computer science.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.200
What did you study?

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.720
Communication science, media science, and linguistics.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.480
Because when

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:05.780
I was

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.700
trying to decide what to do for university,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.860
it was weird because I didn't really feel

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.620
like a programmer. I was always programming

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.820
on the side, but I thought of programmers

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.060
and it was like boys from the computer

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.640
club. There was no one really...

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.800
Also, being a young

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.560
woman, there was not really any

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.940
role model or

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.160
idea like, hey, I'm actually a programmer too.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.120
Absolutely.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.620
We talked about how your linguistics

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.400
experience brought you into NLP

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.040
stuff which got you into programming, right?

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.480
I did a tiny bit

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:35.600
of

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.540
Pearl in university, but I'm not really

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.640
counting that. Everything we were

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.820
doing there, I kind of already knew

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:41.620
from,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.480
I

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.560
don't know, just hanging around myself.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:44.940
Sure.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.340
Who else?

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.380
Who else wants to share?

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.940
I think everyone

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.920
majored in here. I was computer

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.920
technology. I took

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.320
an

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.020
engineering course in C, an engineering course in Fortran, but I wouldn't

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.560
call that a

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.720
computer science background. No. Interesting, but not a computer science background.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:05.660
Gina? I

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:11.360
actually have, yeah, what is now a master's degree equivalent in computer science.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:18.200
For me, I also grew up programming and figuring that that was the most amazing thing ever.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.780
And then I learned that it was an actual job.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.260
And that was when I knew what I wanted to become.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:31.120
But to this day, I say I didn't learn much programming or anything like that at university.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.320
I learned tolerance towards frustration and stress management.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.120
But all of the programming stuff is actually mostly self-taught, I would say.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:42.580
Because also,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:48.460
I mean, yeah, we did some assembler stuff and some really weird old stuff at university.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:56.720
Also some Java, which later became my main job before I went into the whole maintainer with Python situation.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:10.060
But yeah, I think it's more been a case of lifelong self-teaching and trying to stay up with things that are happening and learning new languages here and there and such.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.220
Yeah. It's not like engineering or something where it's kind of stable.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.520
You know, bridges are still bridges.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.700
Stuff is changing fast. You've got to stay on top of it.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.300
That's really interesting.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.380
What's

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.300
your background, actually?

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.080
Oh, Michael.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:23.520
Sorry.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.260
Yeah, well, I

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:31.820
am pretty close to where you are, Ines, as well.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.660
I was in school for a long time. I love school.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.040
But I studied math and chemistry, mostly math.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.640
And I only did just enough programming to do the research projects I was on,

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.620
which was very, very little until the very end.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.300
And then I'm like, you know what?

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.360
I kind of like this better.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.080
What am I going to do to keep doing this?

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.620
Because it seems like the job opportunities are way better

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.200
and it's much more interesting.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.900
So, yeah, I'm definitely on the self-taught train.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.460
Yeah, that's me.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.620
But it's really my father.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.220
He was an electrical engineer and designed electronic cash registers.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.460
So I started programming catch registers when I was eight.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.980
The original point

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.720
of sale, amazing.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.160
Yeah,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.160
from the very beginning.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:16.880
And then

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.500
when the

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.100
TRS-80 Model 1 shipped in 1977,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.940
I was in the radio shack for the next year.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.680
Because that was the only thing I was interested in.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.960
A whole 4K of RAM.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.460
Amazing.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.260
Yeah.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:37.020
So then my first part-time job after school was repairing TRS-80s

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.960
for a company called HNS Microsystems.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.980
I've never done anything else.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.480
So by

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.540
the time I graduated high school,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.340
I did my last two years of high school living on my own,

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.720
making a living as a programmer.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.160
So I didn't go to university.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:50.680
I was too busy working.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.060
Well, I think it paid off for you.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:55.920
I think it turned out all right.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.520
Yeah, it did okay.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.360
It did okay.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.160
I have the advantage of being first.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.460
Yeah, exactly.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.200
Yeah, that's amazing.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.940
reading the specifications of the IBM BC before it was released and going,

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.220
640K of RAM, who's going to need that?

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:12.740
That's

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.840
way more than you're ever going to need.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.960
All right, so what does Stack Overflow say?

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:23.760
It says that about 75% of the people have a bachelor's or a master's degree,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.200
but only a little under, where is that number again, school,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:38.020
A little under 50%, just under 50% of the people actually are using school to become software developers.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:52.500
Then, you know, how we, so pretty much all of us here are in some way or other having to keep up with this technology and libraries and so on our own.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.920
And so the next one asks, like, what online resources are you using?

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.940
So maybe we can go around real quick.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.780
Where are you all spending your time?

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.640
I'll start first.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.640
Probably YouTube for me with other blogs and other things thrown in.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:15.180
But YouTube is a big portion where I learn new things and keep up with stuff.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.080
I'm a reader.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.920
It's the fastest mechanism for me.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.079
I prefer to read my documentation at the pace that I can read it at

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.300
and then test stuff out.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.280
You know, I like YouTube.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.480
It's just too slow.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:32.700
Yeah.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.080
See,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:34.760
I'm a slow reader.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.720
It's funny you say that because I was also like,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.600
my problem with YouTube is like there are so many people on YouTube

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.800
and they all speak really, they speak too slowly.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:43.760
And yes, you

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.680
can like make it faster and it's the,

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.620
but yeah, I have a very similar feeling and it's,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.299
yeah, it makes me happy to see also in the Stack Overflow stats

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.980
to see documentation be so significant

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.080
and also to hear it come up again

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.820
because I've always put so much work

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.780
into our documentation

00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:03.280
and I've always been really passionate

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:03.920
about documentation

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.000
and sometimes I wonder,

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.700
hey, do people actually read this?

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.760
How much does it really matter?

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.840
And so it's nice to see that it seems to

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:11.980
matter.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.100
What you don't see on this list is podcasts

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.920
because who would learn from a podcast?

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.500
Oh my gosh.

00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:19.720
No, no, no, no, no.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:20.340
No, no,

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:20.940
no, no, no.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.180
There, auditory material at the bottom.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.140
There you go.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:24.780
8%.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:25.820
8%.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.400
But I used to not think YouTube was important.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.800
I was also in the same boat of like, this is too slow.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.020
Why are people spending this time?

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:39.620
I feel like that's my disconnected, my brain, recreational learning on YouTube.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.820
But my real hardcore learning is probably more blogs.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:43.780
Blogs and docs.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:45.360
Yeah.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.099
When I want to learn some new language or something, then I go with written things.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:16:00.100
actually like books shocking i know but um uh but when it's like making skills like book finding or

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:05.300
whatnot then it's certainly youtube because then it helps to actually see people do that by hand

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:10.540
it doesn't help me watch someone else code it helps me to read the documentation and understand

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:18.040
how things fit together and click through some library things and such but uh yeah i don't

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:23.440
know this trend towards everything needs to be a youtube video that goes like 15 minutes and

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.820
10 of those are please sponsor me and

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.400
such is

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.940
something i

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.200
don't understand but maybe i'm

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:29.960
smashing the bell

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.480
and all that yeah i'm

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.920
surprised ai is so low on the list because that seems like

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.480
that pair programming i'm going to do it together while some ai explains something to me is

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:43.600
pretty effective like i've seen my kids use that and i wonder that's just a jingo right like

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.519
that

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.380
That was a year ago.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.560
Yeah, it was a year ago.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:46.880
You're right.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.920
Those two, you know, the ChatGPT revolution starts in 23.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.340
Like, it's not in a lot of time.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.320
It feels like forever.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.920
I'm now in the insider version of VS Code with that

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.020
build with Claude.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.900
And like, wow, that thing's a really great tutorial tool.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.420
But that's only been in the past couple of months.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:07.640
Wow.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:09.740
Yeah, time's flying.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.339
I'm guessing AI here, they mean a chatbot type interface.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.360
I know I keep complaining about this and it's maybe pedantic,

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.339
but AI already has this terminology problem.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.339
And I feel like, why do you need to call it AI?

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.740
AI means so many things.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:26.140
And

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.140
it's like half

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.900
of these things have AI in them.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.940
And what do you mean?

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.500
Because I think it's actually, for so many things,

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.060
including how we think about open source software regulation and so on,

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:47.860
It's actually a huge issue that we do not distinguish between products like chatbot products and software components, for example, and call everything AI.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:52.520
And I think ultimately the people that benefit from it most are tech companies.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.760
So I feel like we should stop doing that.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:02.280
So I'm a bit mildly, I mean, not in all, I'm mildly annoyed at Stack Overflow for just calling it AI.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.460
Yeah, I can probably fix it.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.200
Let me just right click inspect.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.100
But in some ways

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.900
it's become the new agile, right?

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:12.300
It's like

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.300
it's a word so overloaded

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.300
and it doesn't mean anything anymore.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:17.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.060
We're

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:18.620
using agile.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.040
It just means we stop writing down the waterfall.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.160
There you go.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.640
Now, I know, Richard, you have an interesting take on a lot of the stuff.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.600
Like things are AI until

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.960
they

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.760
work and they're proven.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.300
Remember that AI is a marketing term for raising money, right?

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.640
Marvin Minsky coins it in the 1950s to get money out of the U.S. military, which, by the way, worked.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:46.120
But inevitably, once a technology works, it gets a new name, right?

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.400
It becomes image recognition or large language models.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.700
So as long as it's called AI, you know it doesn't work.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.860
Still looking for its place in the world.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.920
You'll get a new name.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:14.860
All right. So out on the Stack Overflow survey, technical documentation is the number one. 84% of people say that they do that. Not surprisingly, number two is Stack Overflow, but it's a self-selecting group. So there's that.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:22.940
Tutorials, blogs, how-to videos. I mean, I just want to thank you all. Thank you, everyone, for making me feel weird and being the only one who said YouTube here.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:23.780
Sorry.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.560
No, I'm just teasing.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.260
Seriously, for me, when I'm trying to learn,

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.020
this mostly goes for frameworks.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.160
Like if I want to learn UA framework or I don't know,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.340
seeing it built up as somebody's like,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.660
let me talk you through or show you how I'd build this sort of start to end.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.120
That really sticks with me better than reading documentation.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.679
And once I see that, then I'll go to the documentation

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.400
and AI and like, okay, help me click the pieces together.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.840
Anyway, that's my world.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.680
It's proof you have lots of screen space, right?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.720
That you have your putting window open in one spot.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.220
Then you get the YouTube video up in the top right.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.460
And then you've got the doc down the bottom right.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:08.860
No, I mean,

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:09.400
now that you

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.480
say it, like, you know, it is not actually,

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.900
it's some of it back, what I said earlier.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.140
Also, we did some videos.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.920
I did some YouTube end-to-end tutorials and they did quite well.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.840
And I still have people to this day come up to me, ask me when I'm doing my next video,

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.080
say that they've really enjoyed them.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.060
So there's clearly, there is an audience

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.240
for

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:28.380
it.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.140
Which reminds

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.020
me, I should do another

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.560
YouTube video.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.260
I

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.180
have the script ready.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.900
I just, I'm really bad at

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.100
actually recording. And I have a plural size subscription

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.000
that comes with one of the

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.060
influencer packages. So I tend to go

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.100
there. So it's not like a don't consume

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:43.900
video. It's just

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.140
not YouTube.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:46.520
Yeah, sure.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.960
So during the pandemic, I had

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.160
a couple of sessions where I actually

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.200
just streamed myself while

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.480
working on Octoprint and explaining my thought process.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.860
And that is something that I felt was helping those people a lot

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.340
who didn't have much development experience at all

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.600
and were just trying to understand.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.560
So here's a problem.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.640
How would someone who has done this before approach this problem,

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.540
reduce it into several parts and then approach every single part

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.300
and the thought cycles that are involved and so on.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.420
For something like that, I think a video is great.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:37.880
But if it's something like technology, like how do I program a command line thingy in Go, for example, that is not something where I would watch a YouTube video for, but rather look up code snippets and then try it on my own.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:47.640
So maybe that's also a thing because you said you basically want to move through the process with the developer.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.640
So maybe that is that kind of approach more where you are trying to wrap your head around

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:59.460
what is possible and how can I solve this specific problem versus going into a deep dive into

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:04.080
the API or something like that and just figuring out things that way.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.780
Yeah, I think so.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.740
For me, I like to kind of learn.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:10.760
I want to sort of a surface layer experience of it.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.680
Then I'll want to go a little deeper, then a little deeper instead of trying to like,

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:14.580
anyway.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.940
Let's talk experience.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.500
Now, I know everyone on this call, we're all pretty young,

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.960
but we probably have at least five years of experience doing this stuff.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:28.640
No, I know.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.040
We've been doing

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:29.360
it for a while.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:29.620
It'll take.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.060
Really quick.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.080
Numbers of your programming, top to bottom, Ines, roughly?

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:35.940
Oh, depends.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.440
How do you count?

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.040
Like really professionally and doing this job, it's like it's over 10 years.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.960
I did, you know, start writing my first websites.

00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:49.760
24 years ago.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:50.240
But

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.440
that's

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.120
like, I don't know, I would never say like,

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.560
oh, I started programming when I was 11 and

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.980
that's how much experience I have.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.840
Yeah, no, professionally.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:22:59.040
Like

00:22:59.040 --> 00:22:59.660
really in

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.400
this job and everything, like really doing what I do,

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:03.500
like a bit over 10 years.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.040
Awesome.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.940
First line of code.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:08.880
Professionally.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.500
Yeah, professionally would be 25-ish

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.100
years

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.620
ago.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:16.180
in

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:16.980
general 35

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:17.600
fish

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.360
yeah

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:21.540
awesome

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.260
Richard

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.060
well yeah

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.560
I mean when do you get paid

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.420
right so I was being paid for code

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:30.720
in my

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.260
teens so 40 years

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.380
yeah amazing

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.340
27 years

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:36.960
for me

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.820
I was going to say 27 for me as well I think

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:41.560
jinx

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.880
I feel

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.700
for these people

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:50.160
in the one to four year like range this is a really i think it's a tough time for those folks

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:53.680
yeah but

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.100
also

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:58.480
there's a lot of people still joining the industry like the this what 25 to 30

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:05.360
percent constant ad going into the industry means we're always going to skew young effectively

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:13.840
or like early in in the um you know programming journey because you know i think actually speaking

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:18.880
of trends like what we see I think in especially in AI or in like you know out the machine learning

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:24.940
field like the most successful projects are those where people upskill and subject matter experts who

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:31.000
are like maybe experts in finance in some other area pick up the tools because you know it's never

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.020
been easier to learn programming and solve a problem and I think

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.860
there

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.580
we might have people

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.560
actually quite established in their career but only recently learned programming and I think

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.440
that's an interesting trend and i think with everything um and the way it's going in the

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.600
field i think we'll see a lot more of that

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.320
yeah but is this survey biased that we've got young

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.600
more younger folks may be replying than than older folks but what i made interesting

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.820
is this big jump

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:04.460
there from like we are starting at less than a year with 5.5 percent and then suddenly we spike up

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:11.000
to one to five years one to four years with 27.3 and then the curve ups down again until we are

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.520
at

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.700
I think the less than one year is because they don't find Stack Overflow.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:16.120
Exactly.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:17.960
That is what I'm taking from that.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.400
If

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.920
you're in the one to four bracket, you are constantly on Stack Overflow.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:23.740
And if

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.140
you are earlier

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.720
than that, then you haven't discovered this

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.320
source.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.080
Certainly my experience

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:37.480
consulting into teams is the majority of the developers on a given team are under 10 years of experience.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.540
And they have a senior that's over 10 years.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.120
I would say as well.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:53.300
And just to give you another perspective, so the people listening, the biggest category is one to four years, 27%, and then five to nine is another 25%, so over 50% in there.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.220
But most importantly, it's the one to four years, I believe.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.700
We need to keep that in mind.

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:07.140
Now, you could say Stack Overflow is skewing this because people are just hammering on Stack Overflow and trying to figure out what to do when they're brand new.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:19.460
But the PSF JetBrains survey, which didn't have anything to do with code help site like Stack Overflow, I think 40% were less than three years.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.180
40% of the people doing Python have been doing it less, three years or less.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:31.740
And so it's – I think this is a more broad trend, which is something we've got to keep in mind when we're building libraries, building products, doing

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.400
tutorials

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.100
and so on.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.960
is that a good chunk of your audience will be like,

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.440
everyone knows what a virtual environment is.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.320
Everyone knows what

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.000
ASync is.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.200
No, they don't.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.140
I take back part of that feeling for those one to four year people

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.120
is that they also didn't get to experience Python 2.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.460
They only know the view of Python 3.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.260
Their will has not been crushed.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:55.580
They have optimism in their life.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.120
Much less the migration, right?

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.140
Or like

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:01.920
writing

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.880
Python 2 and 3 compatible code.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:06.820
Oh,

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:07.800
no, no,

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:07.800
no.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:08.560
Stop, stop.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.820
You're bringing back the nightmares and the headache.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:12.760
What were

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.160
you saying about

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.980
gray hair, Gina?

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.300
Yeah, Python 2

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:16.620
to 3.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.420
At least half of that is from that.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.640
Now on the JavaScript side,

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.680
now it's relatively hard to find folks

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.160
that experience Angular 1.1

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.340
and the chaos that was moving to 2, right?

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.820
That's now passed.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:31.340
So, yeah,

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:31.780
in a

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.060
sense, new developers coming

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:33.400
in,

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.100
they get to benefit from the fact that they're getting into stabler tools

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.480
with robust solutions.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.520
There's a lot less experimentation, depending on where you're going.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.420
I mean, there's nobody with 10 years' experience with an LLM,

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.780
so everybody's a beginner there.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:49.240
Yeah.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.260
They'll still be able to experience some packaging grief somewhere

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:52.760
along the way.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:53.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:53.780
Absolutely.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.160
I mean, it depends on how long

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:55.900
you've been doing this.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.780
The deployment sucks.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:57.620
Yeah.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:58.820
Yeah.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:07.000
People call everything an LLM now, so in theory I can go around and claim I have 10 years experience in LLMs.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.100
Relatively large language models.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:19.980
Yeah, you probably all have heard the joke, but I imagine many listeners haven't, that Sebastian from FastAPI

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.620
put

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.140
out there.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.040
He said, I just saw a job posting.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.600
He created FastAPI, right?

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.900
And this is two years into it existing.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.220
I just saw a job posting asking for four years of experience with FastAPI.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.800
He's like, I created it.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.560
I only have two years experience with

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:34.680
it.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.280
I don't know

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.140
who this is for.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.860
Hey, we all have 10 years of experience with AI.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:41.980
Amazing.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:43.260
All

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:43.340
right.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.580
Well, hey, if you're a 10X developer, you get 10 years of experience per year.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.220
I mean, come on.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.120
All right.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.400
Let's talk technologies.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:58.020
And I don't know how you all feel about this sort of, like, what is the most popular?

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:58.920
We love programming language.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:00.720
And

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:00.880
again,

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.040
focus on professional.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.560
But I feel there's a lot of things that are not comparable.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.540
And this one probably is the most you'll have, like,

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.320
SQL versus C++.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.220
You're like, these

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.260
are the same.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.100
Yeah, CSS

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.440
versus C++.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.400
Like, not the same thing.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.460
Anyway, that rant out of the way.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.880
They qualified

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.200
their heading with putting in their markup languages.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.760
Ah, okay.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:29.860
Okay.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.100
But Python and Java and C++ are in there.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.000
C++ is a hardcore markup language.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:40.740
Anyway.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:41.340
So what was

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:41.460
the

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.360
original question?

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.400
It's just for making scripts.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.600
The original question here,

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.920
let me just give people a quick bit of numbers.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.220
JavaScript is number one,

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.380
which they put up as JS, 64%.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.900
SQL is number two at 54.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.260
HTML, CSS, which again are not the same thing,

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.260
but 52%. And then

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.420
Py, which I assume stands for Python

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.360
is 46, then TS

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.500
for TypeScript, but then longer words

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.200
like PowerShell are written out. I don't know why

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.340
some are abbreviated and some aren't. Nonetheless,

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.300
that's kind of what it is. And the question

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.220
is, which programming, scripting, and markup

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.220
language have you done extensive development work

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.040
over the past year?

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.300
So, obviously

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.140
this panel is fairly

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.520
skewed, but

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.420
just maybe

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.280
give me your perspective on

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.500
where you see energy going to these days in different languages.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.100
For example, in Python, we've seen a lot of people move to Rust,

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.900
even though most people are still doing Python and so on.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.220
Yeah, and most is a relative concept.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:43.600
Rust is still at the edge of the long tail, so to speak.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.540
Yeah, Rust is super, super low, actually.

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.660
It's like 2% or

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:47.920
something.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:48.840
It's

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.520
a pretty specialized space to live.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.760
Yeah, it's 11% for Stack Overflow.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.720
but in the trends, I think it's...

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:57.880
Speaking

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.780
of trends,

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.540
one thing I would find interesting,

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.940
can you click on learning to code?

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.060
It would be interesting because they did separate it out.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:05.980
It would be interesting to see

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.580
people who are learning.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:08.620
What are

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.480
they learning, maybe?

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.460
I mean, they didn't ask specifically,

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.420
what are you learning, but extensive development.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.340
And there we have Python at the top.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.960
Yeah, quite a bit.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.220
And HTML, okay, I get that.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.100
HTML, CSS, like everyone's putting together stuff on the web.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.240
You know, I don't know if everyone read the question correctly

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.920
and like really thought about extensive development.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.120
Like maybe people thought, hi,

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:31.760
everyone's

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:31.940
hacking.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.180
No, I'm sure most people who develop hack around with CSS,

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.320
with HTML a bit every

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:39.580
year.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.080
Unaboidably.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:41.200
Yeah.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:42.920
So I'm not surprised.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.560
If you gather all the web technologies together,

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.320
it's a webby world.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.100
If you're making a web

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.400
app, like you have a lot of different languages

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.980
and map-up languages you're interacting with,

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.460
which you don't necessarily have in Python.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.860
Python, you write Python.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.320
Like maybe if you're a library developer, you do some C or Rust.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:02.660
But that's

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.120
kind of it.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:07.620
Whereas, okay, if you're a web developer, you do HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:08.880
TypeScript all

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.220
together.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:13.660
You might do some database as well.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:14.520
You might do that.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:21.340
There's just this huge pile of technologies that come with a certain job, and we just mostly have one.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.920
Yeah, but most Python people are writing a little SQL, too.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.000
You've got to get your data from somewhere.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:27.660
No,

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:33.220
but you can have someone else do that.

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.040
You can use an existing API.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.880
I'm sure I would know.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.860
I don't really write SQL to go through this.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:46.880
And I think I would know a lot of, also I like to call it SQL, but that's a different story.

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:51.220
But I know a lot of developers, I'm sure, who don't write SQL.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.300
I don't write SQL.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.700
Might not even know it.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.380
What SQL?

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:57.520
I was just kidding.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:32:59.980
It's

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.400
called SQL.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.640
I honestly, when I'm talking to databases, I use ORMs and ODMs most of the time.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:05.660
I know,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.920
Richard, you're a big database guy.

00:33:08.039 --> 00:33:08.800
I've been everywhere

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.200
for one time or another.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:10.440
So

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:10.760
it's

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.340
a friendly

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.020
language to me.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:14.100
And apparently, according to the professional developer side,

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.580
lots of people are touching it.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.800
Yeah, about a third, yeah.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.020
Each respondent checked multiple boxes

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:20.520
because we

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.000
rarely

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.700
actually live in one language.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.380
You usually have to go spend time elsewhere.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:26.300
Do you read the

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.100
learning to code as,

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.360
like, that's aspirational?

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.800
They wish they were doing Python.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:32.280
Yeah, interesting.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.220
Did they ask that

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.200
question this year?

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:39.040
Because they used to ask that, right, in the developer survey.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.040
Like what do you wish you were writing?

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:43.500
Yes,

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:49.300
that's in the most loved and most hated and most wanted.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.480
I don't know if that's in here.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:50.740
Actually,

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.120
let's go down to it.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.560
I think they might have stopped as well.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.360
Gosh, because

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:56.760
I love that.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.460
There's an admired and desired section in 2.2.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.220
Okay.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.320
Let's

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:04.520
see.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.620
Admired and desired.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.540
Yeah, there it is.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.159
Okay. This is pretty interesting. Yeah.

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.480
What do the bars mean here, folks?

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.200
Admired versus

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.260
desired, right?

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:18.679
Yeah.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.659
So I admire Python, but I don't actually want to do it.

00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:22.220
So

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.260
admired is read.

00:34:24.169 --> 00:34:27.200
I think this is like a borderline contest.

00:34:27.379 --> 00:34:28.620
I mean, no offense to Stack Overflow,

00:34:28.649 --> 00:34:32.179
but that's like a borderline contestant for the data is ugly subreddit.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.540
Because I find this quite hard to read.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:40.139
It was just people who made this and I don't want to be.

00:34:40.379 --> 00:34:40.500
It

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.040
went on green.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.139
I agree.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.620
Can someone decipher this for me?

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.139
Because I actually don't understand what I'm looking at.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:50.280
Let me describe it

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.500
here.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:50.720
So

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.980
there's a, if you go to the section, yeah, if you go to

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.260
the section,

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.040
there's two bars,

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:59.000
there's like kind of an error bar looking thing with two numbers and it has a

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:04.260
range on the blue one on the left is how desired is it?

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.360
And then there's a red one

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:06.880
that shows

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.240
how admired it is.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:15.080
And you can see the delta, the gap between how much it's wanted versus how much people admire it.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:15.500
So

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.040
Lust is probably the biggest.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.820
Elixir makes the sense to me, right?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:19.600
Because Elixir

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.400
is really

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.020
not easy

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:21.720
to work in.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.020
But it's beautiful when it works.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.140
So it

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:25.560
makes perfect

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.500
sense to me that almost nobody's doing it, but everybody thinks it's cool.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:29.300
Yeah.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.520
Seventy, seven percent think it's cool.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:34.140
Five percent are doing it or actually want to do it.

00:35:36.039 --> 00:35:36.640
that

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.720
resonates with me

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.580
I get that

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.120
that would make sense

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.900
so here we have Python

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:44.780
number one both in

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.020
absolutely number one

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.720
and desired

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.700
not number one in admired

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:51.320
which is

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.880
pretty interesting it's still quite high

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:56.380
up there but there are things like

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.640
Rust which is more admired

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.600
and Zig which is wild

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.080
and even Elixir as you point out there

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.040
but yeah I think this represents

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:07.980
trends pretty well

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.500
yeah when we talk

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.120
about admire

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.060
it's like who are the cool people that are

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.120
talking about this like how much

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.620
did this number move for Rust because

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.940
Racinovich was all over

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:17.160
it

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.960
yeah yeah and in Python we've got a bunch of

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.940
tools that have come along especially from the

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.840
astral folks but others

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.120
where we've seen

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.020
huge benefits because

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.880
people have written in Rust I don't know if that's

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.800
how much of that is we've just put better algorithms

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.500
into it and how much of it is actually Rust.

00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:35.760
But it is Rust

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:37.500
and Rust. I think that puts a lot of shine

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.720
on it, but people are still rather just

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.680
write Python, but it seems impressive

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.640
or cool, and I think that kind of gets captured here.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.020
Yeah.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.760
Yeah, I think definitely sometimes people ask us

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:49.660
and if we were to rewrite

00:36:50.279 --> 00:36:51.460
Spacey from scratch,

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.280
we might...

00:36:54.279 --> 00:36:55.780
Maybe we still use Siphon, but

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.760
maybe we would have also used Rust. It totally wasn't

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.660
a thing back then, but I think

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:00.340
the alternatives

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:00.980
are just

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:07.800
C++ or Siphon, which isn't very extensively documented.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.640
So I can see by Rust, it's nice and attractive.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.880
Yeah, quite interesting.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.920
I want to cover one more from this section,

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:19.780
and then we need to make sure that we save a little bit of time

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.040
for the AI category, because that's certainly going to be a thing.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.660
And that is cloud platforms.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:38.000
So one of the things I find really interesting is how much the big three hyperscale clouds,

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:45.080
AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, to dominate where people are working, right?

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.660
I don't know how often developers make a decision in this space.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.400
Yeah, you certainly have talked to a lot of larger companies that have really big cloud deployments.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:55.960
Give us your thoughts, Richard.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:56.200
Any

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.300
more than most developers choose what database you're using.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:37:59.420
Somebody

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.340
else selected that product and pays for the licenses for it,

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:02.820
and you are

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:03.400
going to consume.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:05.980
I

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.280
will say of the ones that are on this list,

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:10.960
I feel like AWS is the most developer-centric or friendly.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:12.720
I would

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.520
consider Azure

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.620
being infrastructure ops-friendly

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.320
and AWS being like, oh, they're going to throw out a lot more developer-y type things.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.940
We've had a lot of headaches.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.579
I'm not an infrastructure person, but I just know we did have some headaches

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.900
with AWS and Google Cloud

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.220
is like what we ended up migrating to

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.920
because it's much more

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.480
developer friendly.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:35.900
GCP is the most

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.000
developer friendly,

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.100
but the corp

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.200
doesn't necessarily like it

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.720
when you get further afield with it.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:42.640
I think

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.240
what AWS

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.200
has been brilliant at

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.920
is how they manage their startup relationships.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.760
Once you get to a certain size working with AWS,

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.280
a tech shows up to help you.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.500
They've done a really good job

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.740
of cultivating support there,

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.420
plus they are the reference name.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.440
Yeah, and also cultivating developers that specialize in it

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.380
because ultimately that's kind of how it works.

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:03.740
You have DevOps people,

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.020
and if you do manage significant infrastructure

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.560
on any of these cloud platforms,

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.480
you need a developer to do the maintenance on it.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.040
That's also something we've realized

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.140
when we had to downscale some of our operations a bit.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:21.780
The infrastructure is set up so that it needs people to maintain it

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.180
and so that it can do all of the things.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:29.900
If the company encourages more people to specialize in its platform,

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.780
then you also have more companies hiring people to do it.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.560
These numbers say

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.840
they don't add up to 100%.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.420
It's like, listen, as soon as you get to a certain size of an organization,

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.180
you have more than one cloud in your life.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.180
It's just

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.020
not optional.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:45.700
Question.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.080
Can we take a look at the split between professional developers

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.460
and learning to code, just out of

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:50.840
curiosity?

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.240
Yeah, I don't even

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:52.860
know what I was doing

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.480
over in that.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.940
learning to code mix. That doesn't make any sense.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.960
So that is what I would expect. Now

00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.000
learning to code, please.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.080
So just for people

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:01.900
listening, AWS

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.960
52%, Azure

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.200
30%, Google Cloud

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:07.760
25%.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.420
On the pro developer side.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:10.100
Oh, wow.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.100
Ah, hard.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.320
Yeah, Google Cloud

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.720
is number one at 24% learning code.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.900
But the split is way more distributed

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:20.760
across all these

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.000
little areas, which is interesting.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.140
AWS is 20.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.260
And when you talk

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:24.320
about

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:24.640
dev

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.060
-friendly,

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.840
it's none of the big guys, right?

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.620
Like, first selling Firebase and

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:29.160
Cloudflare

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:30.020
and

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:30.760
DigitalOcean

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.860
even I would put up there.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.740
Much more dev-centric.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:34.140
I

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.860
also am a bit confused about, like,

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.960
what do they define as cloud here?

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:40.060
Because I would certainly put Amazon Web Services

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.420
and Azure and stuff into a completely different bucket

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.340
than a v-server hosted at Hezna or at OVH.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.920
So that is a bit weird because, I mean,

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:50.020
I might be missing something,

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.720
but I think neither OVH nor Hezna

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.000
or something like that do have an offering similar

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.640
to AWS and such.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.440
So that's a bit of a mixed bag.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.800
Like Hetzner has basically, it

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.580
has cloud

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:04.880
servers,

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:05.240
it

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:10.400
has cloud firewalls, and it has a beta version of S3 storage,

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.060
and that's it.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.800
Yeah, and you can also, you can

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.200
vertically scale and such.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.600
They have an API for scaling.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.960
Like I have all my stuff hosted there basically,

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.920
but it's definitely not the same thing as all of this orchestration stuff

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.700
that you can do with AWS agents and such,

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.880
or

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.500
even

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:27.920
Cloudflare.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:28.280
So I

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.800
think that's a bit of a mixed thing.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.040
It's clearly evidence

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.740
that they ask developers this question,

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:32.900
not the people actually.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.780
Yeah, but what percentage

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.280
of the developers are using serverless-y things on Amazon

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.300
and not just putting up EC2 instances with their stuff in it?

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.700
Would that be interesting?

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.400
That would be super interesting.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:47.400
Yeah.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.980
Or who does web development?

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.240
Because, you know, we have platforms there that I also use,

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.920
like Vasell or Netlify, which is where we host our stuff,

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.500
which, you know, if you're learning to build a website,

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.320
that's the easiest way to just press play

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.520
and you have a website running,

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.380
but it might not be necessarily where you would even host

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:06.220
the machine learning model.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.560
Although it's kind of, I think they're all trying to break

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.380
into that field as well, but, like, it's,

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.400
I think it's very use case specific.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:15.040
Yeah.

00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:17.620
There's a lot of ways to slice and dice this.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.900
Yeah, I think there's

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.520
still developers coming up to terms with containers.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:27.960
And so they're not even running containers in

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.220
any environment.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:28.740
Yeah, like me.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.100
Certainly in the Microsoft

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:31.580
world.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.220
I mean, mentally coming to terms with.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.440
The Microsoft world containers, because Windows containers are terrible,

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:55.000
Until you're at a place working in.NET where you're comfortable deploying onto a Linux instance, which, by the way, immediately saves you 20%, 25% on your cloud consumption, then containers work.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.460
And now you need to learn all of that as well.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:04.080
Although your AKS is your packaged container services make that a lot easier.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:04.540
So

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.380
folks don't have

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:05.880
to learn it.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.040
They just deploy into a service.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:08.960
Yeah, certainly.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:13.300
Open that space, a lot of people first have to learn Linux, and then they can learn Docker.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.460
or even VMs, right?

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.780
It's a

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.720
big lift for a lot of folks that are just like,

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.660
I have a GUI for my web server.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.180
Is there a container section on this survey?

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.260
Did people talk about that?

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.480
Let's see.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:28.820
No.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:30.440
It

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.140
falls into dockerism and

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:32.880
other tools.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.300
It's another tool.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:35.820
Yeah, okay.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.600
I have all of my stuff running over at Hetzner

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:41.940
as well.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.500
I'm a massive fan of Hetzner.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:43.840
sad.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.280
This is a year ago, but still.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:48.220
Still.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:50.420
Yeah.

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.000
I don't even know what.

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:53.280
I just can't.

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.480
It's so spread out

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:55.940
all over the

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:56.160
place.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.020
I believe there's like

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.400
I don't know.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.460
There's things like PIP

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.940
and NPM, but also Kubernetes.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.160
Not

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:06.940
really sure they're the same.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:09.420
Or a Visual Studio solution, which is the file format

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.300
for an application.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:11.860
That's a

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:12.820
tool?

00:44:15.979 --> 00:44:18.880
this is a grab bag of random words yeah it

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.360
is oh we're just gonna skip on all right we have just

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:27.380
a little bit of time to like for the finale here and i think i want to put the caveat out

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:33.220
here as we talk about the ai section that one there's a lot of hype it's all over the place

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:38.320
it can mean different things to different people also as we talked about the beginning this is a

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:45.420
year old and a year in ai years is probably like 10 years so

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.220
and i do worry about virtue signaling

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:52.920
here too just like this is almost asking to recycle right

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.060
yeah but

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.780
i know i break my glass

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.040
in

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.040
the backyard and just leave it there right yeah i did

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.180
grab the 2023 numbers because they

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.480
as well just to compare these two because i didn't follow the instructions on badly

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.760
behaved oh no

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:07.560
That's good.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:14.500
So the key number there, that's 60%, and in 2023, it was 40%.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.020
Okay, 50% growth.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:20.760
I mean, admittedly, GitHub Copilot at that point was already three years old.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:27.500
We tend to think from ChatGPT forward, but GitHub Copilot came first, the original Copilot.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.060
Yeah, for sure.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:29.220
And

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:29.840
it's been there,

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:30.760
it feels like.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:37.220
I really want to focus on the sentiment and sort of how you all are using this as to kind of close this out.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.460
However, or not using it, which is fine.

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.080
But I do want to just – there's a really interesting graph here.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:52.080
If you look at the Stack Overflow language trends, which show how many questions appear on Stack Overflow for that technology,

00:45:53.600 --> 00:46:03.860
Python has had this meteoric growth, almost hockey stick, not quite, but almost until 2023, really.

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:06.860
Like late, late 2022, right around

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:07.420
November.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.080
Is this graph really just showing the demise of Stack Overflow?

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:10.520
Yes.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.720
If you look

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.260
at this graph, there's a massive drop of Python there.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:20.280
But there's also a massive drop of JavaScript and some others as

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:20.880
well, but certainly

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.700
the most popular ones.

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.180
And that is basically when ChatGPT came out.

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:28.680
And that is a really interesting developer trend on its own right there.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.920
But I do think to put this into perspective,

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:34.980
also are new questions on Stack Overflow a good thing?

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.100
Like that's, I think that's another, you know, yes, it looks like, oh.

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:38.640
But

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.320
I

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.060
mean, yeah,

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:40.780
maybe the people

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.340
who would have otherwise opened a question

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.500
that was already answered like two years ago.

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.060
Yeah, they found their answer on ChatGPT and that's great.

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:53.340
We don't need the internet to be flooded with a lot of redundant information.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:53.860
I know

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:56.680
to stack overflows.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.380
You're hinting at the other aspect of it,

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.840
which is getting progressively harder to add questions to stack overflows.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:04.220
Yeah.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:06.340
I

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:07.940
think you're right, Ines.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.920
I think people are just going elsewhere,

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.160
and that's kind of what I was thinking there.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.040
The question

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.440
that graph just there,

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:19.440
was that questions asked for that thing or search terms for that?

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:20.080
thing

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.380
because it's

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:21.800
a huge

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:22.120
difference

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.740
over time based on

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.340
I think it's question asked yeah

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.420
or maybe answers as well but it's

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:30.520
not search terms

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.040
it's

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.240
content I believe on there

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:35.680
I just wanted

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.100
to make sure okay and

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:37.580
just in case

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:39.120
people are worried that maybe it's

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.500
it's crashing or something

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.300
you can look at the

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:43.320
the T

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:44.900
the T-O-B

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.839
T-O-B I can't

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.780
index. I can't type

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.840
and I know I spelled that but you know what? We're going to get that

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:52.560
fixed. There we go.

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:57.520
I don't know. I just

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.800
don't even. I mean if you look at Python

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.580
it's still year over year

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:02.260
up

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.120
6%.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:04.520
Which

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.820
is not just faster

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:06.940
it's like 6

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.040
3 to 6 times fast. It is a blowout

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:10.960
level of growth.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.180
It's all new depth.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:14.160
People

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.760
coming in, using

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.820
a chat tool to learn programming

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.320
And it's really

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:19.560
good

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.040
at Python.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:20.500
Like

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.700
if you want to navigate,

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:27.400
yeah, it's VS Code with the free copilot, teach me Python.

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:28.560
You're going to have a good experience.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:29.740
Yeah.

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:30.800
All right.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:39.920
With that out of the way, what's your whole sentiment personally for AI?

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.080
And maybe how do you see people adopting?

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.520
I love the 20% of the time.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:43.820
No,

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:44.800
and I don't plan to.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.140
I bet you they all skew older.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.520
that's probably true

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:52.440
Ines

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.880
what do you mean by AI?

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.780
you live somewhat in the

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:57.740
you live in the ML space

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.360
you're kind of AI before AI

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:01.280
like legitimately

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.140
yeah I

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:03.320
guess

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:04.760
I don't know what

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.180
AI is

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.000
let's

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:06.200
say

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.360
LLM

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:07.660
yeah

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:07.960
let's say

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.480
LLM

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.980
but like LLMs

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.620
that generate text for a human to read

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:14.220
because

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.020
what

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:17.580
tools

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:24.960
What tools do you use as part of your development process, not as part of your API or for your app to run it, but what do you use to write code, basically?

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:25.620
Let's go with that.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:26.560
Yeah.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:27.080
Yeah.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:40.780
So I don't actually, I don't use many models a lot to, like, actually help me write code because I think the stuff I do is, like, specialized and specific or often, you know, it's, like, very specific things in, like, the libraries we're building, for example.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:49.320
But I do think to explain code to you or for workflows like infrastructure and stuff, that's where it's like really helpful.

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:56.840
Also, I know my co-founder, for example, he's also he's done a bunch of quite complex infrastructure stuff, like setting things up with Terraform.

00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:01.660
And they're really having a model summarize and explain it to you.

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:03.160
That is very helpful.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:12.140
Yeah, yeah. I've done things like, explain this Docker Compose file to me. What does this line mean? I don't understand this.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.480
Does it mean

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:26.120
if it fails, it'll restart or if I should have done it restart? What does this do? And it really is quite good at that. Interesting. Yeah. So not so much. You're not vibing. Let's put you as the non-vibing.

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:26.280
Yeah,

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:39.500
yeah. But I found out that actually, because we've always, I think I might have mentioned this before in another context, but we've always put a lot of, in the libraries we write, a lot of work into all this backwards compatibility stuff, making sure we don't break users' code.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:47.620
And this actually had a very positive side effect, which is that these models are really good at writing, for example, spaCy code.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:55.660
And it's never something we planned. We were just like, oh, we just want to do all the boring stuff right and make our users happy.

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.140
But yeah, this really paid off.

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:01.340
Like I've heard these models, Copilot, ChatGPT,

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.320
are really good at writing code for our libraries.

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.180
And you

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:06.320
were

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:06.620
assuming

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:06.960
that's

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.080
a good documentation, right?

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.400
And we always put a lot of work into our documentation.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:11.780
I think

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:15.560
that may have added to that as well.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:16.500
Yeah.

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:17.760
Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:20.040
Gina, what do you think?

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:22.560
I know you're not a super--

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:23.140
No.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.660
You're not an AI accelerist,

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:25.160
let's say.

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.820
Let's say I consider myself an AI skeptical.

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:30.900
So

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:31.860
the thing with

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:35.600
me is when Copilot came out as a GitHub star,

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.300
I had a very early access to it and then I started using it

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.660
and I allowed it to autocomplete a lot of my lines.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:45.180
I found it an amazing help in translating my stuff

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.720
because I write everything in Octoprint in English first

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.540
and then the whole UI needs to be translated to German on every release.

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.520
And doing that by hand is a lot of work.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.120
And having the I make suggestions is really nice in that case.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:03.040
And then AI started to get shoved into my face from every place all around me.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.880
And I read up on the energy consumption of that stuff and the water consumption of that stuff.

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:11.380
And that they were thinking about firing up additional power thingies again just for

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:11.780
that stuff.

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.880
And that was when I decided, okay, I'm not going to use this anymore.

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:16.340
I'm refusing to use this.

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:22.600
And I have disabled co-pilot and try to not touch anything AI if I can.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:28.380
simply because I don't like how it is getting pushed into everyone's throat these days,

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:28.920
down

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.960
everyone's throat these days.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.560
I actually do

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.460
have a free account on ChatGPT.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:39.000
I sometimes have the problem that I forget words in English or in German

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.000
that I can still remember how to describe.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:43.940
And then when I do not have anyone I can describe that to,

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.200
I can describe it to ChatGPT and then it tells me,

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:50.080
oh, you did mean, I don't know, interface or something like that.

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:51.560
And then I'm like, yay, exactly.

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:52.520
And I'm happy.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.080
But other than that, I don't touch that with a 10-foot pole anymore

00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.160
because simply it's just too much.

00:52:59.320 --> 00:52:59.800
I don't like

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.940
hypes at all.

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.940
But what do you mean it's genitive models?

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.420
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.740
No, you are completely

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:10.240
right

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.160
because I get this little shock every time

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.800
that I am also into game development.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.860
And now every time that I read or watch a video about how to build

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.020
some kind of AI for a game.

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:25.460
My initial reaction is always AI.

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.880
And then I realize, no, stop.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:27.740
That's a good type.

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:29.500
That's the thing that makes the characters

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.900
and NPCs walk around and such

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.380
and pathfinding and whatever, right?

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:36.480
But yeah, I'm totally with you.

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:38.100
I just suffer from the same problem.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:38.800
Yeah.

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:41.980
You're a very principled person.

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:43.120
I definitely admire that about you.

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.060
It's tough.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:47.580
I do hate having AI jammed into everywhere.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:53.940
my email client can rewrite stuff with the ai and it almost

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:54.680
never comes

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:55.520
out the way i want and when

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.080
i do all the formatting is lost

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.020
yes i

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:01.960
know and do you get comments like that where i'm like i know

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:08.420
exactly like why do you want to encourage people to write these shitty comments on posts that add

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.540
absolutely nothing and then

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.300
essentially spam and that you then need

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.920
another chat thingy to

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:16.420
parse again in order

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:17.180
to summarize

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:18.960
and for that, that's like completely

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:20.840
like, yeah,

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:21.360
why?

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:24.620
I know it. All right. Well, you don't have a

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.400
time left. I got to keep moving along here.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.880
All right. Richard, where are you

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:29.220
on this?

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:30.680
Look,

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.820
you know, I'm talking to a lot

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.840
of PMs and things who are saying my team

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.960
is 25, 30% more productive

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.840
using these tools and they can

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.760
see just more check-ins of

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:41.440
more code

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.340
with fewer remediations.

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.120
what we saw in the first

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:49.360
like six months of the team using it is more

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:51.480
reverts because they were over committing

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:52.720
with the code they

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:53.560
didn't fully understand

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.420
but over time they got better

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.300
at it and when they did check

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.600
when they actually got to the PR and merge

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.200
the code stuck so

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.400
there was a lot of fewer problems

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.300
net to the point now

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:06.960
where it's like I kind of can't hire anybody

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:09.240
if they're not using these tools because it's like

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.460
they're not using an editor

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.420
the productivity level is substantial

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.660
if they're in the workflow.

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:15.180
And

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:15.920
I noticed going

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.340
further down the list of data here,

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:20.440
like the AI and the development workflow,

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:21.960
they're using it for writing code.

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.120
That's what it's doing.

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.500
It's code completion and it's, you know,

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.140
describe the problem and it gives you a first gen

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:31.000
and you can iterate a couple of times on it.

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:32.960
But this is also a year ago.

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:33.860
Like the ability

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.000
to write

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.600
PR explanations and things

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.720
was only just emerging when this survey was being done.

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:46.000
Today, I notice everybody's PR explanations are wildly better

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.980
because they didn't write

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.100
them the tool did.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.120
Yeah, I've seen that.

00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.380
And also maybe as

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:57.640
a bit of a positive outlook, like I do think we're already seeing that

00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:02.380
it's possible to use local models and use much smaller models, you know, that you can

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:07.740
actually run on your laptop and with the device constraints that you have.

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.180
And it's like, it is a subset of things.

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:11.560
I think I was just reading something today

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:18.740
about also Visual Studio Code supporting more local models

00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:20.560
and adding more features for that.

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:20.860
So I

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:22.820
think, because it's such a specific thing.

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.380
I feel like we're starting to right-size now.

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:24.980
That it's,

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:25.660
you know,

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.060
the initial iterations of these products,

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:29.160
we're throwing as much meat at them as possible

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:29.440
as they

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:29.940
weren't sure they were

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:30.340
going to work.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.120
And now it's like, hey, too much is also a problem

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.420
because it goes off on weird wandering

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:37.640
and we've been able to narrow the models.

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:43.100
Companies can have their own internal fine-tuned models as well, like something really small.

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:49.320
Okay, that model just writes PR descriptions for our team that works in this field with Python.

00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:50.260
And then it's small.

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:51.460
Everyone runs it locally.

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.420
It's data private.

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:54.300
You don't need to send your shit to

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.080
GitHub,

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.500
to Microsoft, to OpenAI.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.940
It's like it all stays internal and you have control over it.

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:06.300
And I do think that would be a good compromise and,

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:06.900
you know, solve

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:07.780
a lot of the problems.

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:14.080
But, of course, it's something that there are a lot of companies out there, especially very large companies that do not like this kind of vision.

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:32.980
And, yeah, that's also why I'm so passionate about not calling everything AI, because ultimately, you know, it really just benefits big tech who, you know, likes having us call chat, us for chatbots and open source software into the same bucket and regulate it exactly the same way.

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:33.200
because

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:36.060
they'd be able to deal with it.

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.780
As you go

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.380
following

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:38.180
Gartner's pattern

00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:40.220
into the trough of disillusionment,

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.100
you do end up with dumb regulations

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.180
to respond to social concerns

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:46.760
rather than thoughtful,

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:48.300
here

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.060
are the different problems

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:50.440
and how we can scope them more.

00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.100
And lobbied by companies like, you know,

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:54.580
OpenAI, for example.

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:55.200
Yeah.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.880
The incumbents want to lock in their

00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:58.400
advantage.

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.440
Where's our regulatory capture,

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:00.840
please?

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.880
We need to work that in to the various places.

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.600
All right, Calvin.

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.140
Well, for folks who know me,

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:09.120
they probably know that I'm an eternal optimist

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:11.720
and I'm definitely very excited

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.160
about the AI developer tools.

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:15.560
I'm actually giving a talk on it

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:18.360
like next week at IndiePy about this

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.240
because there's so many good options out there.

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:21.380
Now that said,

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.580
I feel like these tools definitely benefit

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.640
the senior coders more than they do the junior coders.

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:27.820
Like I feel like this whole,

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.400
every time I hear the word vibe coding,

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:35.160
I shudder, kind of like Gina does, around anything that says AI.

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:43.480
So I think there's a great potential for a lot of tech to be produced very, very quickly with those kinds of tools.

00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:49.320
And I feel like under poor guidance or poor mentorship, there's a lot of damage that could be done.

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:51.460
But the upside is so good.

00:58:52.060 --> 00:59:05.020
kind of like Richard, like we're probably only going to hire somebody who is basically augmenting their personal skills with a set of tools behind them that make them perform at a higher level just in general.

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:07.000
There's so much upside to it.

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.280
And I do love the local tools.

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:12.660
Like I run Mistral Small and Llama 3.3, all that stuff locally.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:17.500
And so nothing's going off my laptop to interoperate with a lot of my tooling.

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.760
There's so many good open source options, too.

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:22.240
I know a lot of people are excited about like quad code and,

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:22.880
and,

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:23.200
and,

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:23.500
uh,

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.220
get copilot,

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:26.280
but the,

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:27.960
the Ater chats,

00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:28.340
the,

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:29.060
the goose,

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:29.940
um,

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:30.740
uh,

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:31.280
clients,

00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.820
those things are really incredible and they're open source.

00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:34.840
They all run local.

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:35.920
They're there.

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:37.320
Another tech.

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:40.720
I want to jump on the terminology bandwagon.

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:41.780
They're agentic,

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:42.380
uh,

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.080
another terrible abused word.

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:44.640
Uh,

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.460
everyone's using,

00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:50.040
but the tools like goose and Ater will run commands locally.

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:54.600
locally on your machine as a proxy to figure out things.

00:59:54.780 --> 01:00:00.160
And I love that capability that is now doing an introspection, exploration, understanding.

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:03.780
It's really a great usage of the reasoning models.

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:08.700
And being able to use multiple models simultaneously against the code base is really, really powerful.

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:10.440
And I don't think a lot of developers see that.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:15.960
I think a lot of people just jump into like a ChatGPT or a quad and try and just brute force their way to a solution.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.120
And I don't think that's the right approach.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.460
I would love to see more folks take a measured approach to this

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:25.280
and really make it small incremental improvements,

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.580
and you get a lot of win there.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.180
Is that the topic of your talk?

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.660
Are you going to talk about that?

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:33.440
A bit.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:33.820
I'm

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:38.360
going to take five of the current developer tools like that

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:39.040
and compare them.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.340
I'm going to basically take a session.

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.440
Oh, that's cool.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:41.980
You need to

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.680
send me the slides.

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:44.140
I

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:44.500
really want

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.800
to check it out because I recently just had a conversation

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.700
journalist who wanted to know about these things and brought down some of the thoughts and it was

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:55.020
it actually really mirrored um what you all have been saying

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.700
so um

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.020
yeah i want to look deeper into

01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.040
this yeah

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.920
because some of them have superpowers that are different than the others and i

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.040
don't

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:02.680
think folks understand

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:08.000
that either like uh for example the goose no goose goose is very get

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:12.760
aware no i'm sorry take that back ader chat because even in my brain they don't say straight

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:16.400
Aider chat is very Git aware and it uses it as its undo function.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:22.260
And it's very deeply, the prompting that they put into it understands Git really, really well,

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.400
which means it can quickly discern what's going on in a code base.

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.500
Because it basically does a mapping of your repository structure

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.900
and then uses that to know when to pull stuff in.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.620
And again, I'm super positive and pro on this stuff.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.580
And the fact that Aider can use local models,

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:40.100
mix them with anything else you want to pull in there, it's really flexible.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:45.960
You're not tied to some AWS or Google or OpenAI or Anthropoc.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.740
I'm also interested in this.

01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:50.360
Are you going to be recording that talk or streaming?

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:50.740
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.580
It'll be recorded and it'll be streamed.

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:53.480
We'll have it online.

01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:53.780
Good.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:54.120
So I

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.560
could go back to YouTube and watch it there like I do

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:57.100
not have to.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:57.900
Or you all can

01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.720
join and ask

01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.660
great questions.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.120
Awesome.

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:00.460
Okay.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.220
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:02.420
No, it does sound super awesome.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.000
IndiePy.org,

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.280
a little plug for, I'm a co-organizer, co-founder of IndiePy, the local Python group here too.

01:02:09.019 --> 01:02:09.740
In Indianapolis?

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:10.840
in

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.920
Indiana.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:12.100
Yep.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:15.880
I would say,

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:16.280
well,

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:16.720
for me,

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:17.440
I've,

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.340
I've definitely gone on a journey through all of this stuff.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.080
When I first saw it,

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:21.220
I,

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.220
I still,

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:22.720
to this day,

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:27.120
feel like LM's probably border on copyright theft.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:28.240
So I'm,

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:28.720
I'm a little,

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.900
I'm a little displeased with them.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:31.140
Well,

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.120
maybe a lot displeased,

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.360
but what are you going to,

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.260
at the same time,

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.760
that horse is out of the barn.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.540
It's not coming home.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.100
It's gone.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:38.720
Right.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.120
And so then you got to say,

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.300
Well, now what are we going to do?

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.120
Am I going to just pretend this doesn't exist

01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:47.580
because I'm a little bit put off by that?

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:56.280
When everyone else is using it to create libraries, tools, applications, content, et cetera,

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.580
that's not that reasonable either, right?

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.540
To Richard's comment about the productivity, right?

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.400
You've got to be practical.

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:06.600
I would also found them to be fairly

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.120
mind-blowingly cool

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.460
but somewhat inaccurate

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:15.100
but that's kind of like a 2023-2024 version

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.040
now if

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.420
you get to the higher level models

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:19.340
they are so good

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:22.260
they are so powerful and so effective

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.300
that it's

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.260
if you stopped messing with them a year ago

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:29.600
because you don't want to

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.120
because they're not really that accurate

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:33.680
I would encourage people to look at it again

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:34.960
and maybe look at Calvin's talk.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:39.400
And then Gina, for your concerns, I also share those,

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.280
although I definitely have a ChatGPT subscription these days.

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.640
Check out stuff like LM Studio and other ways

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.360
of running it local.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.600
You can avoid a lot of the melting the power grid.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.540
I mean, then I'm paying for the energy cost.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.500
That's also a problem.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:56.760
Yeah, but

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.760
it's

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.160
not that.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:03:59.320
You can

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.200
run

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.520
lower models that take

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.960
not that much time.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.280
I mean, most of the energy costs

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:06.280
is training.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.960
It's so efficient, I mean, efficient

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.660
relatively to everything else out there.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.200
It's so efficient.

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:14.360
And we haven't gotten to optimized yet.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.440
No, yeah, you're right.

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:16.940
It's still

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.560
in its infancy.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.040
Yeah, this is, in five years

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.840
it's going to be, the local models

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.860
especially I think are going to be really much more

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:25.140
capable.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:27.980
We saw DeepSeq already.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.140
And this is driving innovation

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:30.740
around abundance.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.100
I think we're going to have

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.440
new solutions to these energy problems, new solutions to the cooling problems.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.980
Like we can't continue, obviously, down this route.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:43.460
I do share Gina's concern, but again, I think I come at it with a very optimistic,

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.700
maybe overly optimistic view.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:47.660
Maybe I wish I was a little more

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:50.460
realistic about

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:50.620
it.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.300
I think Gina is right that there is a problem that has to be addressed.

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.240
Yeah, but also we

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.400
are coming out of this hype.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:58.880
Yeah.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.180
I don't know what the Gartner cycle is calling it again,

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:07.700
but I call it the post-type hangover sort of in that phase.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.080
And

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:08.480
I think

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.540
then there's going to be a more reasonable mindset.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.180
I've always been advocating for smaller models,

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.820
more task-specific models,

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.120
using these large generative models to create systems

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.780
rather than as systems.

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:25.000
Using them as systems, that's kind of 2023.

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:29.060
What we're doing now is using them

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.020
to help

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:36.320
us write code, but also using them to create data for smaller models, which is probably possible.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.740
And that's not old NLP.

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.560
That's just, yeah, next level.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:45.620
Maybe to not only say something negative about that, also maybe something positive on my side about that stuff.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.080
So I find it very interesting.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.320
And I think there are some great tools or going to be some great tools.

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.640
They're utilizing this technology.

01:05:54.860 --> 01:06:02.500
And only if the person using it is actually able to determine whether that stuff it is outputting is actually good.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:03.520
Yeah.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:10.960
Only if it is, it doesn't necessarily have to run locally, at least not for me, because I am developing open source anyhow.

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:13.620
So everything I do is going to be out in the open anyhow.

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:18.420
But yeah, some privacy aspects are also something that are to be considered.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:19.560
So local would be nice.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.460
Lower energy costs.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.520
And please allow me to disable this stuff when I don't want to use it.

01:06:29.059 --> 01:06:35.320
Because I don't want to have every single tool start waving at me all the time going,

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:40.420
hey, by the way, you can also now use my chatbot interface when I'm like, no, I'm just happy

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.080
if you list my files here, dear file listener.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.560
If I list that, something like that.

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:57.660
You know, the other day I was looking for a new terminal and found stuff that was also trying to tell me that it has AI in it, whatever they meant with that.

01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:00.520
But I don't need a chatbot interface when I'm trying to write bash.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.800
So thank you very much.

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:03.080
So

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.260
give me an off switch.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:05.940
Allow me to run this stuff locally.

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.920
And, yeah, don't shove it down my throat.

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:19.180
And also don't try to plaster it all over the place as the solution for every single problem, especially for people who don't fully understand the problem space yet.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:25.500
Because then we also get like in the open source situation, we also get a lot of issues now generated with

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:25.860
AI,

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:26.860
security

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:27.260
tickets

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:36.780
generated by AI, like suggestions from people to help other people generated by AI that are completely wrong and are causing more problems than anything.

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:41.340
So if all of this stuff stops, then yes, then I will take another look.

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:45.380
But until then, I'm just fed up up to here with that.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.280
And I can't

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:46.820
stand it anymore.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.040
No, I agree.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.860
I mean, and I work very closely in the space.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.040
And I absolutely agree with your points.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:54.280
Yeah.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:55.460
Yeah.

01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:56.820
All right, everyone.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.040
I think we're just getting started.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.260
We could go for a very long time,

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.100
but we also are out of time.

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.620
Ines, Gina, Richard, Calvin

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:06.760
thank you all for being here

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:07.820
it's been a lot of fun

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:09.600
thank you

01:08:11.279 --> 01:08:11.820
bye all
