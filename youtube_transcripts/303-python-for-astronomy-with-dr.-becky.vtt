00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
- Hello everyone out there on the live stream.


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thanks for joining us.


00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.920
If you have any comments,


00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.840
throw them into the live comments


00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.720
and we'll try to make it part of the show.


00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.880
Dr. Becky Smethurst, welcome.


00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.840
Welcome to the podcast.


00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.940
- Thank you. - It's so good to have you here.


00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.320
- Yeah, it's great to be here.


00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.840
I'm just happy to have the chat about code


00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.400
on a Thursday afternoon for me.


00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.880
- Yeah, well, one of the things that I like to do


00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.920
is I like to tell stories of people


00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.400
doing amazing stuff with Python,


00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.840
not making Python necessarily their entire world, right?


00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840
Like it's awesome to talk to the people


00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.920
maybe at Instagram and how they're


00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.640
building Instagram with Python,


00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.920
but I think it's also really neat to shine a light


00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.480
on people doing other things like astronomy


00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.300
or economics or whatever,


00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.680
but also using Python as a superpower.


00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.080
And it definitely gives,


00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.320
definitely get the sense that that's kind of your world.


00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.440
- Yeah, it's fun like thinking about,


00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.480
not just all the things that you can do with Python,


00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.880
but like humans in general can do the things


00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.400
that I am doing with Python.


00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.080
Like that we figured all of this out,


00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.840
you know, that we can then use a tool like Python to do it.


00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.520
It kind of blows my mind that I get to do that every day.


00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.520
- Well, in your world,


00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.360
there's probably a lot of supercomputers and high-end,


00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.800
you know, there's a lot of stuff behind the scenes,


00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.280
behind maybe a simple Jupyter notebook, right?


00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.680
- Yeah, just a little bit.


00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.240
Like the Oxford physics,


00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.560
like a supercomputer is called Glamdring as well.


00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.080
Like everything's Lord of the Rings references


00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.200
and sort of like, Zully's like, you know,


00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.520
like conversations you have with other physicists


00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.360
in the department being like,


00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.640
"Oh, did you get time on Glamdring?


00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.960
Like, how did you get hands on Glamdring?"


00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.800
Like it makes it sound like we're passing around this sword


00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.520
between us all like a dull sword.


00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.360
- That's amazing.


00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.760
And I, you know, we're going to talk a bit


00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.560
about your YouTube channel,


00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.920
some stuff that you're doing there as well


00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.640
to popularize astronomy and code and whatnot.


00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.640
But in one of them, you talked about how


00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.080
at Oxford where you're working,


00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.080
there's actually some of the scenes


00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.360
from Harry Potter were shot as well.


00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.160
So there's all sorts of cool fantasy movie tie-ins here.


00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.000
Right?


00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.840
- Yeah, definitely.


00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.120
So Oxford has the colleges and my college, Christchurch,


00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.520
is the one they used in the first film


00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.640
for the steps up to the hall where like,


00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.120
Trevor finds his toad and McGonagall welcomes them and stuff.


00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.280
So the amount of times I've walked up those steps


00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.120
and like quoted parts of the film


00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.440
'cause I'm such a Potter head.


00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.440
But then also I managed to like somehow get past the referee


00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.160
on one of my scientific papers to name galaxies


00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.760
after Harry Potter characters.


00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.600
Because like when I was at the telescope taking the data


00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.480
I was highlighting them like red, blue or green,


00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.040
depending like whether I was observing them


00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.480
on like Tuesday night, Wednesday night or Thursday night.


00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.720
And so I named all the red ones after Gryffindors


00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.960
and all the blue ones after Ravenclaws


00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.320
and all the green ones after Slytherins.


00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.440
So yeah, I ended up with, you know,


00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.760
writing a paper that was like,


00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.040
Hermione shows interesting features.


00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.560
(laughing)


00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.400
It was great.


00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.240
- Oh, that's fantastic.


00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.080
I love that.


00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.200
So let's kick off a little bit of background about you


00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.840
with a comment from the live stream.


00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.920
Robert says, "I like Dr. Smither.


00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.040
"She reaches for the stars."


00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.880
Fantastic.


00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.400
So maybe tell us a bit about yourself.


00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.320
- Yeah, sure.


00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.240
So I am an astrophysicist.


00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.680
I work at the University of Oxford at Christchurch.


00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.680
And I research how supermassive black holes affect galaxies.


00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.120
And that's sort of like my day job.


00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.400
And that includes, you know,


00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.480
going to telescopes and taking data,


00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.360
coming back, analyzing that data with Python


00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.840
and then writing it up and publishing it to the world.


00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.800
But then sort of as like a side hustle,


00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.920
I guess you could call it,


00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.440
I have my YouTube channel


00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.320
where I like to just chat to people


00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.600
about space and astrophysics


00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.760
and all the research that's going on, you know,


00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.880
in astrophysics right now,


00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.120
because I think there's often a disconnect


00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.640
between the public who are like,


00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.360
I think so many people are interested in space in general,


00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.320
because it is one of those things


00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.200
that there's just an abundance of questions


00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.440
that we don't know the answer to.


00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.600
And that's why we're still doing the research.


00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.400
And so everyone is so curious about it,


00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.520
but they don't have a friendly neighborhood astrophysicist


00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.240
to ask the question to.


00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.200
And that's why, you know, try and be for people


00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.320
and highlight, you know,


00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.280
what it's actually like to work as an astrophysicist.


00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.600
'Cause I think a lot of people don't really know that.


00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.640
It can feel sort of very opaque,


00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.800
sort of the academic world of research


00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.240
and being a scientist,


00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.520
but then also, you know, being like,


00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.080
oh, there was this new research study published.


00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.160
What does it actually mean?


00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.480
Why do we astrophysicists care?


00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.760
Like what implications does it have for, you know,


00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.160
our field in general?


00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.240
How does it fit in?


00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.680
All those kinds of things.


00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.760
And really combating as well,


00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.320
like the rise in the sort of, you know,


00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.280
conspiracy theory science on YouTube as well.


00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.880
I feel like if we just flooded YouTube


00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.920
with like real scientists and real academics


00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.480
actually doing the research, you know,


00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.520
that know this stuff, then I guess we can combat that.


00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.120
- Yeah, so that's amazing.


00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.840
Two thoughts.


00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.560
One, I think astronomy is interesting


00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.160
because it's both so close to everyone, right?


00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.600
You go out at night and you just look up


00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.560
and you can't help but go, wow,


00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.560
I can almost see the craters on the moon.


00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.880
Like it's right there.


00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.920
And yet at the same time,


00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.080
it's also super inaccessible, right?


00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.640
Like if we want to study, you know, Newtonian physics,


00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.800
we can throw a rock and watch the parabola,


00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.920
but we can't really access the stars in that way


00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.600
or even the planets other than, you know,


00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.160
they look like stars themselves, right?


00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.440
Basically, unless you get a proper telescope.


00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440
- Yeah, exactly.


00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.440
There's so many steps that go from just using your eyes


00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.920
to observe the night sky to stepping through, you know,


00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.040
buying binoculars, buying telescope,


00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.760
buying an adapter that can adapt your camera


00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.360
to a telescope that you've bought to, you know,


00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.200
putting together loads of lenses of cameras


00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.960
to make a telescope or going to them like a professional,


00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.160
you know, telescope that's built with these incredible


00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.480
detectors that let us see the faintest


00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.680
of faintest of features.


00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.200
And with that is where we can start doing some science.


00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.640
But, you know, I say, even in the 1600s,


00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.440
what, you know, 400 years ago or so,


00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.440
people were still doing naked eye astronomy


00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.440
and learning things about the stars


00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.080
or even just with binoculars or telescopes, you know,


00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.080
a very small telescope that's maybe less than 100 quid,


00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.040
$100, you know, you can see the moons of Jupyter


00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.520
and you could night by night, every time it's clear,


00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.960
go out and sort of show, okay,


00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.440
the four brightest moons of Jupyter are here, here, here,


00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.960
and here around Jupyter.


00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.880
Oh, the next night they've moved.


00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.240
Oh, and the next night they've moved again.


00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.080
And that's a project you can still do at home.


00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.800
And okay, yeah, we might understand that,


00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.200
but that would be one way that you could test gravity


00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.480
or test the positions of Jupyter's moons,


00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.240
or even a guy called Olber used one of the moons of Jupyter


00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.000
to work out the speed of light, 230 years ago.


00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.800
So there is still stuff you can do,


00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.360
but yeah, it can feel like, you know,


00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.280
it's not accessible to the things that we're doing


00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.720
in terms of black holes or dark matter


00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.560
or anything like that.


00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.160
You do need, you know, seven years of education or whatever


00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.440
to be able to grasp that and do research yourself.


00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.680
But I guess that's why I wanna be on YouTube.


00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.000
It's kind of saying, okay,


00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.880
you don't have the seven years of maths


00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.080
and physics behind you, but here's the gist of it.


00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.520
You know, here's what they're saying


00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.800
and here's what it means, you know?


00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.640
- Yeah, so the other thing, amazing.


00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.480
The other thing I wanted to mention or get your thought on


00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.480
is you point out that there's all this misinformation


00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.560
and it just boggles my mind.


00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.080
I just cannot comprehend how we live in a time


00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.560
of so much accessible information.


00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.080
And yet there are people, you know,


00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.360
there's a guy in the United States


00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.240
that was convinced the earth was flat.


00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.840
So he built a rocket, shot himself up in there


00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.160
to disprove it and then crashed and died, I believe.


00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.120
Because he was like, yeah, I gotta prove it's flat.


00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.440
All these people keep telling me that it's not.


00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.120
And you know, it's so good on you


00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.840
for putting out like interesting, compelling, you know,


00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.200
stuff for, you know, science for people to learn about.


00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.640
- Yeah, I think it's also just like really getting out


00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.280
like the process of science.


00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.360
Like you collect evidence, you test an idea you've had,


00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.920
but if the evidence doesn't match that,


00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.080
you have to change your ideas.


00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.480
And I think that's where people get stuck on science


00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.200
is that they have some emotional attachment


00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.440
to an idea like the earth is flat.


00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.240
They can't change their mind when presented with evidence


00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.000
that isn't, but it's the same thing where people like,


00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.680
oh, I've never really liked the idea of dark matter.


00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.200
So I'm really skeptical of it.


00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.000
You know, like it's the same thing.


00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.240
It's like, well, you know, you have to look at the evidence


00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.040
and as begrudgingly as astronomers eventually came up


00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.120
with the idea of dark matter after ignoring


00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.720
sort of the evidence for years,


00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.280
you know, that was sort of something that is like,


00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.160
when you understand the history of all that stuff


00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.960
that's built up, it's very easy to see why we think


00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.800
what we do.


00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.040
And I think that's something I try and focus on


00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.200
to try and combat those sort of like science skeptics


00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.400
or, you know, people who have emotional attachment


00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.240
to stuff like that.


00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.240
And this misinformation is the how we know,


00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.120
not just what we know, 'cause I think that's so important.


00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.280
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.120
I know there's a lot of stuff going around this,


00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.960
like this whole coronavirus era, like, well,


00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.280
the scientists said this, and then they changed their mind


00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.160
and they said something else after further research


00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.000
was done.


00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.320
So they must have no idea what they're doing.


00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.560
Like, no, that's called science.


00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.160
You make up your own, and then you follow up.


00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.920
All right, so let's get into some of the coding topics


00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.880
a little bit here.


00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.280
You know, before we get too far into it, you know,


00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.320
how do you get into programming in Python?


00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.400
You know, out there on the livestream,


00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.160
we also have a sort of similar question,


00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.240
maybe you could tie them both together.


00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.960
It's how do you learn Python for astronomy


00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.240
as an intermediate Python program?


00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.840
I have an intermediate Python program,


00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.080
so any advice on how to get better


00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.040
to apply Python to physics?


00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.240
- Yeah, sure.


00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.240
So I didn't even come across coding or Python


00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.120
until I was at university.


00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.040
So it must have been my second or third year


00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.760
there was actually Python courses


00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.280
as part of the physics course.


00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.560
You know, teaching it you from scratch, basically.


00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.440
And I never learned it at school


00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.280
because it just never crossed my radar.


00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.040
Like I did what would be the equivalent


00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.240
of sort of like IT computing for what we call our GCSEs


00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.120
up to when we're 16, but that was like Excel spreadsheets.


00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.960
- Right, right.


00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.640
More like computer fluency stuff, yeah.


00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.560
- Yeah, the practical exam was like a three-hour


00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.400
practical exam.


00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.560
I think I finished it in an hour and I was just like,


00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.720
oh, God, it's just an Excel spreadsheet.


00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.520
So I wish we'd done something like that then


00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.840
'cause I think it would have prepared me better


00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.240
because so much science is ingrained in Python.


00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.560
And it was great, the introduction we had at university


00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.840
because we learned the basics,


00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.480
but then the next minute you were like,


00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.840
okay, so code up Einstein's theory of general relativity


00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.720
'cause there's just the laws that you follow


00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.120
and do that round a black hole


00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.920
and look at how the strength of gravity changes


00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.640
as you get closer to it.


00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.800
You know, that was something that was really cool to be set.


00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.320
And it sounds so complicated to try and code up,


00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.440
but it's like a couple of functions


00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.040
and you're done kind of thing.


00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.280
So yeah, I found that so difficult at the time,


00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.920
but looking back now, I'm like, that was so simple.


00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.520
- Why did that seem like, well, you know,


00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.480
thinking back to the code that I've written,


00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.040
I remember being so just thrilled and satisfied


00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.960
of getting some simple little program working,


00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.320
but it seemed like a giant achievement at the time.


00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.120
You know, it probably fit on one screen and whatnot,


00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.200
but that's how it is when you're learning, right?


00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.760
- Yeah, I mean, even just like being like,


00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.280
what is a terminal?


00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.880
You know, like print hello world,


00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.720
like what is this?


00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.800
I remember that being such like a mammoth,


00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.800
like obstacle to get over of just like getting


00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.720
into like the language and everything like that.


00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.600
But that comes from just immersion, right?


00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.560
In it.


00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.560
And the same thing is true for learning how to apply Python


00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.640
to astronomy or to physics.


00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.720
It's immersion in both the language that's used


00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.920
in astronomy and physics,


00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.800
but also then the coding modules that are so useful to you,


00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.000
like Python modules, for example,


00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I'm just gonna shout out the Astropy Consortium now,


00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.120
'cause they're incredible.


00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.080
It's this whole open source project that's developing,


00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.200
you know, everything from how to, you know,


00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.360
plan your observations if you're using a telescope.


00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.680
So you give it coordinates of an object and it's like,


00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.320
this is when this is visible in the sky, you know,


00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.600
to, you know, then reducing that data or converting,


00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.560
you know, a redshift to an age of the universe,


00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.280
for example, like something cosmological,


00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.960
like, you know, that people would be writing


00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.280
their own little, like HTML widgets


00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.640
for like about 10 years ago,


00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.640
but now is so ingrained in the Python master stuff.


00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.480
So there's a lot of them.


00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.520
- You know, so much of it seems like it would be very,


00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.640
like a huge challenge, but these days,


00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.880
it may be 20 years ago, it was,


00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.440
but these days it's, you know, grab this package,


00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.600
call that function, know what it does, right?


00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.080
And then, you know, grab something on Astropy


00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.880
or something in Jupyter or Plotly or Altair and off you go.


00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.920
- Exactly, so I would definitely,


00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.840
if anyone wants to get into it,


00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.640
definitely recommend starting with the Astropy project,


00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.200
'cause they have so many tutorials and everything,


00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.000
'cause it's all open source that


00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.680
they're all probably Jupyter notebooks as well.


00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.440
So it would be a great sort of jumping off point


00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.400
to get involved.


00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.720
Say, you know, wanna get into astrophotography maybe,


00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.600
and you wanna reduce your images,


00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.720
clean them up with Python,


00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.880
that would be a really fun project to do.


00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.280
- Yeah, fantastic.


00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.200
Quick, maybe related question from Frey out there is,


00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.960
do you use basic Python or is there a special Astropy?


00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.280
I think that's interesting.


00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.320
- No, it's the usual Python.


00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.760
You know, there was a big sort of like collective,


00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.880
like, oh, change to Python 3.6 or 3.7,


00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.720
whatever it is, during the Astrophysics community


00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.040
when everyone's stuff broke,


00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.520
but it's the normal basic Python


00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.080
just complemented by the Astropy package.


00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.280
- Yeah, I think that's one of the powers of Python.


00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.640
And maybe you could speak to this


00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.120
from your slice of science,


00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.720
but I think this is why Python is so popular


00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.440
for computational science in general,


00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.680
is that it's just Python plus, right?


00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.320
And it's so accessible, right?


00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.320
You can start out with a very simple program,


00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.400
add to it, add to it,


00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.200
and you never think of yourself as a programmer,


00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.400
but all of a sudden you end up with functions in a package.


00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.520
You're like, what am I doing?


00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.720
How do I become a programmer, right?


00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.080
- Exactly, yeah.


00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.280
I think that's the thing about programming,


00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.800
though, is as long as you have a task,


00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.320
you're rolling, right?


00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.400
You're on your way to becoming that.


00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.280
It's almost like not knowing where to begin


00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.080
or not knowing what to do with it that sort of scuppers you.


00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.160
So yeah, it's sort of weird


00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.080
that you can do so much with Python.


00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.160
It's so flexible for data tables,


00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.760
but I can also pull in an image that I've taken as well,


00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.040
or I can, you know,


00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.800
the idea of NumPy as well is just an absolute lifesaver.


00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.360
Like the fact that I can,


00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.080
you know, the fact that it's like, you know,


00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.520
row and column manipulation,


00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.760
you can do something across the entire array.


00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.040
Like I have images that are arrays, right?


00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.760
So I can do something across the entire image


00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.240
with NumPy like that.


00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.600
And it, yeah, it's just, it's so easy to use.


00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.080
There are some tools in astrophysics that, you know,


00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.680
we have languages called IDL that were really developed


00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.960
for astronomy. - Specifically for astronomy,


00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.920
yeah. - Yeah.


00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.400
And I find IDL hell, sorry, excuse my language.


00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.960
But like I find you run it and it does a different thing


00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.920
the second time you run it.


00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.760
And I'm like, why?


00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.320
(laughs)


00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.600
- It should not do that.


00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.440
- Oh, it shouldn't, no.


00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.800
And then like IRAF as well,


00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.480
which is a similar thing that was developed,


00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.280
but they're just, they're not as intuitive


00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.440
and easy readable as Python, I don't think.


00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.200
And so I think that's why Python has really took off


00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.680
in the astronomy community.


00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.200
- Yeah, yeah, very cool.


00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.920
Well, the next question I always ask my guests


00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.760
after introductions,


00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.720
is what they do day to day.


00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.640
But I kind of want to anchor our conversation


00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.600
around your YouTube channel


00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.680
on these cool videos you put out there.


00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.000
So not only do you have an answer for that,


00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.800
you have an incredible video.


00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.640
- A whole video.


00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.600
(laughs)


00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.480
- So yeah, an 18 minute video you put together


00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.840
of a day in the life of a Oxford astrophysicist.


00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.840
And basically it's like a time-lapse with commentary, right?


00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.520
Maybe you want to just talk about,


00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.560
you know, summarize that video for people a little bit.


00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.960
- Yeah, sure.


00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.200
I get, 'cause I just got asked this question so much,


00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.680
like, what do you actually do?


00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.760
And I just figured the easiest way was to show people.


00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.760
So I show people everything from, you know,


00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.080
leaving my house and getting on the train


00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.240
to arriving at the office and lunch


00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.720
and all the things in between kind of thing.


00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.240
So there's a mixture of, you know,


00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.040
me doing everyday things like checking emails.


00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.920
That's almost part of it.


00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.040
Communication between your colleagues to say,


00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.240
oh, I've got this new result.


00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.360
I've got this new plot.


00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.360
Oh, can you read my paper?


00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.480
This is really cool.


00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.600
Checking all the new research that's been published.


00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.200
- Yeah, so you literally, sorry,


00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.480
you literally have like the time-lapse of,


00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.720
say you at your desk and you're like,


00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.560
oh, that's on the screen.


00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.680
I must've been doing this right now.


00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.360
Oh, now I'm doing this, something in Jupyter


00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.800
and now I'm off to this.


00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.640
- Yeah, exactly.


00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.080
So there's bits of me working with Jupyter


00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:35.920
and definitely like doing,


00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.440
I was doing a little test of my hypothesis


00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.360
'cause I had some new data that came in.


00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.960
I then went to a talk that was given by a visitor


00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.840
to the department who was one of the leads


00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.120
in the event horizon telescope


00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.800
that made that picture of the black hole,


00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.520
the orange donut as people call it.


00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.880
- That was such huge news.


00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.960
A couple, was that last year or a year and a half ago?


00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.160
- A year before, 2019.


00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.440
That's crazy.


00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.400
But yeah, so that was really cool to show people


00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.040
that that's part of our day.


00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.400
We go to talks and listen to people present their science.


00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.000
And then also, I happened to be on the radio that day.


00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.320
I picked a very exciting day.


00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.160
So I was like, go to the radio.


00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.080
- Yeah, it's so glamorous.


00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.400
Like, oh, I'll be this person


00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.760
who's probably gonna win the Nobel Prize


00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.800
and here I'm on the BBC for a while and back to lunch.


00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.760
- Yeah, so there was just lots of bits in my day that were,


00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.440
and then also, we have a big, what we call a journal club


00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.400
where we bring a research paper


00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.760
that's been published that week


00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.360
and we go through it in our research group


00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.200
and talk about it to find out how it fits in


00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.520
with our research, that kind of thing, and what it means.


00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.960
And I get a lot of my ideas from videos


00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.680
from those kind of journal clubs as well,


00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.760
'cause I'm like, we talked about it as colleagues


00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.720
and then I'll make a video on it to sort of say,


00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.360
well, this is what we found cool this month kind of thing.


00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.480
And yeah, it just showcases the whole day,


00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.560
but then also a little bit,


00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.160
it's why it's an Oxford Astrophysicist


00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.200
because it's also like,


00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.360
we also took the speaker to college dinner,


00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.520
which is like a very fancy dinner in a nice room


00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.960
and we all got dressed up and had drinks


00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.560
and stuff like that, it's like very Oxford.


00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.040
But it showcases that side of it


00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.760
because that networking side of things.


00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.560
So there's code in there, there's a talk,


00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.960
there's lunch, there's dinner, there's everything.


00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.560
So it was a fun video. - Yeah, it seems fabulous,


00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.440
actually, yeah, yeah, it seems really great.


00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.520
So one question, I guess one quick meta question,


00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.640
and then one other question.


00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.600
So how did you film this?


00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.000
Is it just eight hours or 12 hours


00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.160
of full-on high-res video or?


00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.200
- It wasn't high-res 'cause it was on my old iPhone,


00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.480
so it was like 720p, so it wasn't that high-res.


00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.160
I think it was, yeah, I cleaned my phone basically


00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.640
of pretty much every picture and video I take


00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.280
and backed it up and then literally just carried it around


00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.320
in my little GorillaPod all day, plonked it on the desk,


00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.920
and then took it with me wherever I went.


00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.800
And I would stop it if I was leaving the room.


00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.680
I would set a new file going


00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.520
so it didn't break or anything.


00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.520
And it was permanently plugged into a charging block as well


00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.480
'cause it was an old phone,


00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.240
so it was running out of battery constantly.


00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.320
And I just took it everywhere and I felt stupid doing it.


00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.160
(laughing)


00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.000
Just carrying around being like,


00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.920
"Hi, yeah, sorry, I'm filming."


00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.640
But people were always asking me what I was doing


00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.480
everywhere I was going and people loved the idea of it.


00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.680
So yeah, it was fun.


00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.160
- Yeah, it seemed really interesting.


00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.600
I actually thought you did a great job with it.


00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.760
The non-meta question is,


00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.680
what did you learn about yourself?


00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.440
Did something surprise you?


00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.440
Did you go, "Oh my gosh, I had no idea"?


00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.480
- I remember thinking this was quite a full day,


00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.960
but it didn't feel like I was rushing around


00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.800
or doing anything.


00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.840
I just think when you watch something in time lapse,


00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.320
it feels so busy.


00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.160
So all the comments were like,


00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.400
"Oh my gosh, she does so much in a day.


00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.280
"She looks so busy."


00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.840
And I was like, I didn't feel that way kind of thing.


00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.400
But I felt like I was like,


00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.080
'cause there's a part of it where it's filmed mid November


00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.400
and the Christmas adverts for all the big department stores


00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.440
have just come out in the UK.


00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.960
And there was a part of it where I just caught myself


00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.280
watching one of those.


00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.240
And I was like, stop wasting time in your day on Twitter


00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.920
or watching videos.


00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.840
So there was bits like that, I guess, that I learned


00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.840
that I was kind of like,


00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.560
"Gosh, that's literally sort of like so much time."


00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.000
One thing I did find though,


00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.600
is that I was very productive


00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.160
because my phone was always recording.


00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.120
I couldn't just pick up my phone and scroll or anything


00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.000
because it was always filming.


00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.840
Yeah.


00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.120
So I had quite a productive day because of it.


00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.480
- How interesting.


00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.680
All right, well, let's go ahead and jump into


00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.680
sort of the main topic here is


00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.240
the reason that you caught my attention


00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.040
as maybe a guest for the show is


00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.960
you did this really interesting video,


00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.560
five ways that I use code as an astrophysicist.


00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.280
I think this relates back to that superpower.


00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.520
Python is a superpower, not,


00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.040
we should take all the people that are in finance or math


00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.120
and turn them into programmers,


00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.560
but people that have interests,


00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.000
give them some other thing.


00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.480
And you really touched on how programming


00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.440
is so valuable, but it's not necessarily communicated


00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.520
to that when you're in the sciences.


00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.400
I did a math degree and I don't remember really


00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.120
till maybe my senior year in college


00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.000
when they're like, "You really need to learn programming."


00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.200
That was just for a research project, right?


00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.600
- Yeah, I think I was the same.


00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.920
I think I was given various different projects


00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.080
that were like graded in my second and third year.


00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.000
And then in my fourth year,


00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.480
I was given a research project on galaxies.


00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.920
And it was like, "You're gonna need code to do this."


00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.760
And that was when I finally became comfortable using it.


00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.120
And you realize, "Oh, I have thousands of galaxies.


00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.120
I don't have to do this in an Excel spreadsheet.


00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.240
There's a better way."


00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.280
And if you have images, you have to analyze,


00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.160
"Oh, I can do it in the same function.


00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.520
I can do it in the same piece of code or whatever."


00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.720
And yeah, I think that's not communicated


00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.000
how much and how many different ways


00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.480
you are gonna end up using it


00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.880
and how many ways it just makes your life


00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.720
just generally easier to use it.


00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.960
- There's problems you could solve without writing code,


00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.240
but if you know how to do it,


00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.160
there's no way you would spend half an hour


00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.640
doing something by hand.


00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.080
Like, you know, we just write a little program


00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.560
and in three minutes, half of it's done ever and ever.


00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.160
Every time, over and over, yeah.


00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.800
- Yeah, there are things that I've picked out in my day


00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.320
that I've been like, "I do this nearly every day.


00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.320
I should just write a function for this."


00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.480
And you just save yourself so much time.


00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.760
- Yeah, I totally agree.


00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.520
There's certain things I have to do


00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.760
to work in my business and I'll just be like,


00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.920
"This is so painful.


00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.040
I can't believe I have to do this."


00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.560
And I'm like, "Why have I not stopped


00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.200
to just write a program that does this?


00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.840
This can be automated.


00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.280
Why have I done this for three months


00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.600
and suffered over and over?"


00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.040
And then I'm just endlessly happy when I do that.


00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.440
So let's cover the five ways.


00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.400
Like, you've already set the stage


00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.040
of why people in science in general


00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.000
and astrophysics in particular


00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.080
should care about these things.


00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.440
But what are the five ways?


00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.120
- Oh, it reminds me what order I put them in.


00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.960
I can't actually remember.


00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.120
- I got them here.


00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.160
The first one you gave was image processing.


00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.040
- Yeah, okay, so this is a big one for astronomy,


00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.560
obviously, is that we, you know,


00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.200
I am an astrophysicist and an astronomer.


00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.600
So I take images of the sky


00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.360
and then use them to do my science.


00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.080
There are some people who are very theoretical,


00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.040
so they'll either run computer simulations


00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.400
or they'll work with sort of the maths


00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.040
and so they don't really tend to do that.


00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.960
But as an astronomer, I take images of the sky


00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.240
and I have to analyze them.


00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.560
So for one thing, you have to remove


00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.320
all the sources of noise in the image.


00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.920
So that's essentially just, like I said before,


00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.040
it's a NumPy array, right?


00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.920
Because all you've recorded when you've taken an image


00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.600
of the sky is how bright each pixel is.


00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.040
And so what you want, say you're observing,


00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.440
like I would be, I would be observing a galaxy.


00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.720
In my image, I would have the light from the galaxy,


00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.960
but I would also have background light


00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.880
from just the sky in general.


00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.040
So like light from the sun that's scattered


00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.760
around the atmosphere and then hits the detector,


00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.240
but also just noise that comes from the detector itself.


00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.200
So the detector thinks it's detected light,


00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.720
but it's actually just that it's a little bit warm,


00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.640
for example, you know?


00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.520
So the way it does it is light comes in,


00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.600
pings off an electron from in an atom,


00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.680
but that can happen if the atoms are just a little bit warm.


00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.040
- Yeah, you give an example of,


00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.160
even if you close the shutter and have no light at all,


00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.440
it kind of looks like a background,


00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.000
we're in the TV channels.


00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.400
You know, you had like that antenna, not the cable, right?


00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.960
- Yeah, it looks like static.


00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.760
Yeah, exactly, it looks like fuzz.


00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.080
So you have to remove all those things from your image


00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.800
if you just want the image with galaxy leftover at the end.


00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.320
So there's clever ways you can do that.


00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.600
Like you said, you just leave the shutter closed


00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.240
and you get an idea for what the noise looks like


00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.360
for that detector.


00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.120
You can take an image of just like sky


00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.840
and then you'll work out, okay, well, that's the noise


00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.640
I need to remove for that bit and everything.


00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.040
And again, it's just non-pair, right?


00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.040
It's just taking them all out.


00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.000
And sometimes you'll also have cosmic rays


00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.280
that come in and hit your detectors.


00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.440
So that's really super high energy radiation.


00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.080
And it looks like just a little sort of super bright pixel


00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.080
or maybe three pixels, like they're just like,


00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.160
and if they're off to the side, it's fine.


00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.240
You just take them out.


00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.000
But if they're right on top of what you want to observe,


00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.680
that's so annoying.


00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.520
And similarly with-


00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.720
- That's where the exoplanet transit is supposed to be.


00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.560
What's going on?


00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.440
- Yeah, exactly.


00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.760
Similarly with like satellite trails as well,


00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.640
which is obviously becoming a bigger issue


00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.200
with sort of the SpaceX constellations


00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.160
and everything like that as well.


00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.000
All those need to be removed.


00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.880
- Is there gonna be some kind of AI type thing


00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.240
that just goes, I now detect SpaceX satellite transit


00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.080
and can just-


00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:43.920
- Stop observing.


00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.160
Yeah, I think that's hopefully the sort of moving forward


00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.720
is that more will be shared between astronomers


00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.480
and sort of the people who are manning


00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.440
those big constellations of satellites.


00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.680
'Cause it's great what they want to do.


00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.600
They want to bring internet to the farthest corners


00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.360
of the world, which is always great in my book.


00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.000
It just, moving everything to space in terms of astronomy


00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.920
is just not feasible.


00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.680
Like the money it would cost and everything.


00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.080
And like the fact that you can't fix them


00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.880
if something goes wrong, if they're in space.


00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.640
We still need telescopes on the ground.


00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.360
And so if there's some form of, yeah,


00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.560
like you say an AI that's like,


00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.280
warning, SpaceX satellite trail coming.


00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.920
Like you just sort of stop your observation


00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.960
and start up again.


00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.840
But yeah, if we don't have that at the minute,


00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.680
so you sometimes do get a satellite trail


00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.520
that's not in there and you have to remove that.


00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.000
And it's so easy to do with Python.


00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.320
Again, AstroPy, there's loads of functions in there


00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.000
that help you out as well with removing


00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.240
so that the detectors aren't always perfect either.


00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.920
So they have a response function, we call it,


00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.320
where they'll have some efficiency of like 95%


00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.040
in the middle, but it will drop off at the edges.


00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.480
And so you'll have to account for that as well


00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.200
in the processing of the image.


00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.480
All those kinds of things you can use Python to do.


00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.600
- You've got to somehow adjust what the telescope sees


00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.000
and retrofit that to try to be as close to reality


00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.480
as not what the picture says, right?


00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.120
- Yeah, and there are sometimes as well.


00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.760
So one of the things that can affect your images


00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.920
is just turbulence in the atmosphere.


00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.040
So the same turbulence that you get when you're on a plane


00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.760
and you pass through like a warm or a cold pocket of air


00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.160
and all of a sudden you feel it shake.


00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.680
If light passes through that, it can get really distorted.


00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.000
And so they actually do some real time adjustment of images


00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.960
on some telescopes.


00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.640
So you might've seen images of telescopes


00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.120
where they're pointing like a giant laser


00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.840
out of the top of them.


00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.560
And that laser, you're essentially recording


00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.440
what happens to the laser as it passes through the atmosphere


00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.040
and the same way that noise canceling headphones work,


00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.080
where they record the noise and then invert it


00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.520
so you don't hear it.


00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.480
You record what's happening to the laser,


00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.240
invert that and put it on the image


00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.680
that you're getting from the telescope


00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.960
and you can get rid of the atmosphere.


00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.240
- How interesting, I'd never realized that.


00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.080
- Ruining your stuff.


00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.720
- Yeah, I always wondered how they were able to


00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.560
account for like the waves of heat


00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.400
and all sorts of stuff in the atmosphere


00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.880
and still get these super clear pictures


00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.360
from ground-based telescopes.


00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.720
- That's how they do it, lasers.


00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.960
- Awesome, it's like it's in the future, but now.


00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.240
All right, so the next one that you talked about


00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.720
was data analysis and processing large quantities of data.


00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.080
And that's actually what's on the screen here


00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.720
in the live share as well, right?


00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.200
You have this really cool example of,


00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.240
was it brightness of 600,000 galaxies?


00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.280
- Yeah, so one of the biggest surveys


00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.000
that's ever been taken, so you can do stuff like I do


00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.800
where you sort of spot, observe galaxies


00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.920
you're interested in, but then there are some telescopes


00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.680
that's just sole job is to survey the entire sky


00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.360
or the entire northern sky or entire southern sky


00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.640
and then you end up with like,


00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.200
here's all the things that's been observed


00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.320
and you have to write algorithms


00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.000
to pick all those out, that's another side


00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.320
of obviously astronomy as well,


00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.480
is like picking out the areas of interest


00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.600
from this huge survey.


00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.600
And you can end up with data tables that are like,


00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.400
here's 600,000 galaxies that have been found


00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.240
with the brightness.


00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.320
So that thing you're showing there,


00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.240
so you've got an ID in the first column


00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.640
and they're like 18 digits 'cause it's all sorts of like,


00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.440
you know, coordinates in there and everything.


00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.440
But then U, G, R, I, and Z is five measures of brightness


00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.720
in different what we call wave bands.


00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.440
So U is sort of like the bluest light


00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.040
and then Z is the reddest light.


00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.760
And so you can, if you look in sort of different colors


00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.280
of light, you can see different things.


00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.440
So blue is lots of new stars, red is lots of old stars.


00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.680
And so that's what you have for like 600,000 galaxies.


00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.800
- That's amazing.


00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.760
- But then you also have all the other things


00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.240
that you might have measured as well,


00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.680
like their size and their shape


00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.600
and you know, various other different,


00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.200
you can end up with tables that are just huge essentially.


00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.200
And you'll see that, I don't know,


00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.600
eagle-eyed people might see that the format for the table


00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.920
is .fits, F-I-T-S.


00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.840
And that's a format that was invented by astronomy as well


00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.760
because it's a format that can both take a table like that,


00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.680
but it can also store an image at the same time.


00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.280
But you can store both a table and an image


00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.560
or many images, you know.


00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.240
So there's all sorts of different things


00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.080
you can do with it.


00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.120
So it's very, very useful.


00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.880
I think it's called a flexible image table system,


00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.360
but don't quote me on that.


00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.160
(laughing)


00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.040
- Yeah, we have full of acronyms in astronomy.


00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.960
So yeah, things like that,


00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.560
where you wanna be able to load in the data table,


00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.800
manipulate that data, you know, say, okay,


00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.920
transform this column into something else


00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.160
that I'm interested in,


00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.280
whatever it might be for 600,000 columns, you know,


00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.600
but you don't wanna do that on an iterative loop again,


00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.040
like NumPy is great for that.


00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.920
It's just, it's a perfect tool for it.


00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.760
- Yeah, and so, you know,


00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.160
maybe if you didn't have Python as a skill,


00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.680
you might try to do this in Excel


00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.880
or maybe even slower would be Google Sheets


00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.280
or something like that.


00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.120
- Yeah.


00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.480
- But I think those have a limit around 100,


00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.960
you know, 1.05 million rows.


00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.920
And then also your mental wellbeing


00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.120
in terms of how long you're gonna wait


00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.160
for stuff to happen, right?


00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.320
- Yeah, exactly.


00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.160
- Yeah.


00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.960
One thing that you do point out in the video


00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.800
when you're talking about this


00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.480
is the mistakes that people have made,


00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.480
especially around the NHS, is that it?


00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.720
- Yeah.


00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.560
- Where the health--


00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.400
- The test and trace.


00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.240
- Yeah, the test and trace stuff


00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.480
where they tried to do this with Excel


00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.560
and, you know, missed a ton of COVID cases in the early days.


00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.280
- Yeah, exactly.


00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.720
Just 'cause, you know, when you have that many rows,


00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.000
it's so difficult to keep track of in a spreadsheet.


00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.040
You know, with this, you can index it really easily.


00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.880
You can say, give me all the rows


00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.400
that have fulfilled this, you know,


00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.120
value or quantity or whatever.


00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.240
And it's just much easier to stay on top of and manipulate.


00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.280
You know, in astronomy, there's lots of people


00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.240
who use, you know, Panda's data frames as well


00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.200
to do this kind of stuff.


00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.200
So, you know, it's using all the tools that are available.


00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.040
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.


00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.000
A couple of listener comments.


00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.520
One is, how long would it take roughly


00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.840
for the code to parse and analyze the data?


00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.880
And what would you do with that?


00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.280
I think that leads well into the next one.


00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.520
- Yeah, I mean, loading data tables,


00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.520
even in 600,000 size is so quick in Python.


00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.520
Like I'd blink and it's done it.


00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.360
- Yeah, exactly.


00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.200
I touched on that.


00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.040
Like you would wait in Excel for a while.


00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.480
- Yeah, you would wait just to open the spreadsheet.


00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.360
Whereas this is just like, yes, I'm done.


00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.560
- Yeah, it's almost instant, right?


00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.400
Probably. - Yeah.


00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.640
And then again, like, I mean,


00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.000
it depends what you're doing, right?


00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.680
If you're, you know, just transforming


00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.120
one value into another.


00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.960
So for example, people who are familiar with physics,


00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.280
like flux into luminosity.


00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.680
So for example, flux is what you observe


00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.000
because you're very distant away from something,


00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.880
but luminosity is like the absolute value it would have


00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.320
if you were like right next to it.


00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.600
That's how bright it would be.


00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.440
- Yeah.


00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.920
- For example, that's just a simple translation, right?


00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.120
So that on 600,000 rows would probably be quite quick.


00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:58.680
But if you're doing something a little bit more complex


00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.800
where you're taking each value


00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.400
and perhaps using it in inference or something like that,


00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.640
like optimizing a model based on all these values


00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.240
or something that would obviously take a lot longer.


00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.600
You know, I've had code run from anywhere


00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.240
from a second to a week.


00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.200
So, yeah, it just depends what you're doing.


00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.280
And then I think it might, yeah,


00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.320
like you said, lead into the next one


00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.920
is what would I do with the data afterwards?


00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.080
I'd make a plot with Matplotlib.


00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.120
- Yeah, and that leads into, yeah,


00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.680
the next thing that you covered,


00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.480
which was model fitting and that sort of thing, right?


00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.760
So Freya asks, how do you search the galaxies


00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.680
and find the ones you need for your research?


00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.920
- Yeah, I mean, so for example,


00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.080
I'm really interested in a certain shape of galaxies.


00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:44.080
So I call them the egg white omelets of the galaxy world.


00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.000
So if you think- - Not the spiral galaxies.


00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.920
- No, so if you think about a spiral galaxy,


00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.880
it's a nice flat disk and it has, you know,


00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.280
the spiral arms on the outside,


00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.360
but in the middle there's usually what we call a bulge,


00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.720
but you can think of like an egg yolk, right?


00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.680
It's like a fried egg, a galaxy.


00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.160
And it has this bulge of stars that instead of, you know,


00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.840
on a nice flat disk where all the stars are orbiting,


00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.560
like in the solar system, like planets in the solar system,


00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.640
you've got stars that look a bit more like a beehive


00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.000
because they're sort of all doing this, you know,


00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.720
in various different planes around the very, very center.


00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.640
And we think those form when two galaxies merge together


00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.480
and you just, you ruin all the nice rotation


00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.640
and you end up with this just big blob in the middle.


00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.080
I'm interested in the things that don't have that blob.


00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.880
So we think they don't, they haven't had a merger, right?


00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.760
And I think, okay, well,


00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.000
what's happened to the black hole in the middle


00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.880
if you haven't merged two things together


00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.680
and shoved a lot of stuff into the center?


00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.720
So that's what I'm interested in.


00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.400
So I need two things to do that.


00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.560
First of all, I need to know what shapes the galaxies are.


00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.280
And that kind of stuff comes from literally,


00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.160
well, two ways.


00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.400
First way that we've been doing it for a long time


00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.200
is people eyeballing the images and looking at them


00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.240
and labeling.


00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.840
They have spiral structure.


00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.960
It has a bulge.


00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.320
It doesn't have a bulge.


00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.280
It looks like it's merging, all that kind of stuff.


00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.000
And that's been done individually by people,


00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.800
from Edwin Hubble back in the 1920s


00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:12.080
to the poor PhD students that are given 50,000 of them


00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.400
to look at as part of their PhD and label them.


00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.800
But then more recently in the past 10 years,


00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.480
a project called Galaxy Zoo,


00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.200
which is a, what we call a citizen science project online.


00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.360
So galaxyzoo.org still running,


00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.160
gets the public to classify the shapes


00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.600
because it's a fairly simple task


00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.600
for even like a five-year-old to do


00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.760
is to show them an image and say,


00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.920
"Is this round and blobby or is this a spiral shape?"


00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.440
And that, 600,000 images of galaxies,


00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.920
that would take one astronomer years,


00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.280
would have terrible statistics.


00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.600
There'd be mistakes all over the place


00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.800
'cause they hadn't had their morning coffee


00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.160
or something yet before they started.


00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.240
We can get instead 40 people to look at each image


00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.280
and it's fantastic statistics and all that as well.


00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.120
And that's still going


00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.960
'cause we're still taking pictures of the sky.


00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.040
But there were people out there thinking,


00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.360
"Well, what about machine learning?


00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.080
Can you train a machine to do this with an algorithm?"


00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.480
And yes, you can.


00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.480
So Galaxy Zoo actually held a Kaggle competition for this


00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.880
as well about five or six years ago


00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:16.760
and found that you can get sort of like 90%


00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.160
sort of like agreement with an expert human.


00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.600
And we're getting to the point now


00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.400
where Galaxy Zoo is running on the website,


00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.320
but we've got a machine in the background,


00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.720
which is deciding what to show to people.


00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:29.560
The machine's like,


00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.840
"I've classified all the simple, easy things,


00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.960
but I'm not sure about these ones.


00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.760
So can you look at this?"


00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.240
So it's sort of like a joint effort


00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.520
and that's gonna be really important


00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.760
with the next generation


00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.520
of big survey telescopes we're building.


00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.760
People might've heard of the LSST


00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.520
or it's been recently dubbed the Vera Rubin Observatory.


00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.440
- And there's so much data coming out of that thing


00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.280
that is ridiculous.


00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.720
- Yeah, they're estimating instead of like 600,000


00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.200
to a million, they're estimating like a billion galaxies.


00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.040
- Wow.


00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.600
- So that's not scalable to get a person


00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.320
or a couple of astronomers to do that.


00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.920
So that's where we need machine and crowd to do it.


00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.200
And yeah, so once you've got those classification labels,


00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.520
either from machine or cloud,


00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.440
then it's just the column in your data table, right?


00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.200
And then you can filter based on,


00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.160
give me all the things with the lowest vote


00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.880
for having this bulge in the center


00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.440
and I'll look at those and sort of whittle it down


00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.280
kind of thing.


00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.000
So yeah, it's really how you choose them.


00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.240
It's just from a data table.


00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.240
- Yeah, once you get the number,


00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.440
then it's super easy, right?


00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.280
It's coming up.


00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:39.280
I did have, recently I had David Armstrong and Yann Camper,


00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.280
they're out of the UK as well.


00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.160
At least David is.


00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.680
How they used machine learning to discover 50 exoplanets


00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.400
in some of the Kepler data as well.


00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.440
So yeah, it's super interesting


00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.880
how ML is starting to make its way into astronomy.


00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.160
- Yeah, and that's another area


00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.760
where ML and citizen science are working together.


00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.240
So there's a, like Galaxy Zoo,


00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.520
there's a project called Planet Hunters,


00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.040
which is using the follow-up to the Kepler space telescope,


00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.160
which is the one that discovered like 5,000 exoplanets.


00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.880
There's now a follow-up called TESS,


00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.760
which is doing the same.


00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.760
And so they're like,


00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.200
we have run our algorithms in the ML on all the data.


00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:20.120
It's found what we've told it to look for,


00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.240
but then here's all the data.


00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.800
Do you see anything else?


00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.720
Do you see planets?


00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.800
Do you see anything weird?


00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.280
Do you see things unexplained?


00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.000
And that's the thing that you really need people to eyeball.


00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.840
- Right, right.


00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.040
The ML is gonna find what it knows to find, but--


00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.040
- Yes, exactly. - That looks weird,


00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.560
but not, you know, but also--


00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.680
- Not what you've told me to look for.


00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.520
- Yeah, exactly.


00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.920
- You know, you can't train a machine


00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.320
to look for stuff that's just interesting,


00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.320
'cause everything will be interesting to it, you know?


00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.400
So-- - Yeah, exactly.


00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.920
Yeah, that's the problem with software.


00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.800
You know, you give it input,


00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.320
it gives you a number out the other side,


00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.040
and it's easy to trust that number,


00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.400
but that's not always the way that it goes.


00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.760
All right, so the next one you talked about


00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.280
was data visualization,


00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.840
and you had some really interesting examples


00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.440
of galaxies colliding, which you kind of touched on,


00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.040
and then also your research is around black holes,


00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.320
and so there's a visualization you show


00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.640
of a star coming too close to a black hole--


00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.400
- Yes. - Being spaghettified.


00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.680
- (laughs) Yeah, that's one of my favorite words ever,


00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.440
spaghettification, is what happens


00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.920
when you get too close to very strong gravity,


00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.800
like around a black hole,


00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.120
where the gravity's stronger at your feet than at your head,


00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.480
so you get stretched out like spaghetti.


00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.320
(laughs)


00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.600
I'll look at spaghetti the same way afterwards.


00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.800
But yeah, so data visualization can be anything


00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.920
from plotting two columns in a data table


00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.840
against each other in a nice scatter plot,


00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.440
and being like, "Oh, look, there's a correlation there,"


00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.480
and then you can fit a line to it


00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.600
with an optimization, like thinking sci-fi or something,


00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.320
and that's one side of it,


00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.400
of sort of data visualization.


00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.200
And then there's the sort of 3D data visualization


00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.920
you can do with Plotly, again,


00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.560
of three columns in a data table.


00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.400
But then there's things you can do like this,


00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:02.120
where you have simulated what's actually happening


00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.080
around a black hole, and you've said,


00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.280
"Okay, my black hole's here,


00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.300
"and I have a star over here that's gonna get too close.


00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.960
"If I codepol the laws of gravity


00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.420
"in Einstein's theory of general relativity


00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.600
"and set it running, what happens?"


00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.440
(laughs)


00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.440
And then visualizing what you actually see.


00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.480
And obviously, the code behind this


00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.920
is literally like an array telling you


00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.760
where more of the particles that used to be in the star


00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.360
now are on this grid that you've made,


00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.000
where one point on the grid will be a black hole.


00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.160
And every sort of time stamp that you run it at,


00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.720
so maybe you do it for every, say, a year or something,


00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.560
I guess, on these timescales.


00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.840
We're talking astrophysics, right?


00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.480
So we're not gonna do that every second.


00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.360
- So short, just a year between frames?


00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.200
- I know, yeah.


00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.960
So a year between frames, you recalculate


00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.920
where they all are now based on the laws of physics,


00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.680
and then you obviously wanna visualize those arrays


00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.640
as something that we can actually picture what's going on,


00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.840
and you can play them as a beautiful movie like this


00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.720
as well, and it looks amazing.


00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.600
But you get, obviously, so much understanding


00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.940
from that as well.


00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.400
And it's fun to, you know, you don't,


00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.920
'cause I don't run a lot of simulations day to day,


00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.800
so it was fun then just to break down


00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.640
what that actually looks like behind the scenes


00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.400
in terms of, yeah, that is just a bunch


00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.600
of NumPy arrays, basically.


00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.920
- Yeah, how interesting.


00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.960
The star is just a bunch of points


00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.360
that represent a glob in the beginning.


00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.160
- Yeah, exactly.


00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.440
I mean, that's all to do with, like,


00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.720
N-body simulations, they're called,


00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.000
so N being the number of particles you simulate,


00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.240
and obviously, the number that you decide to simulate,


00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.760
it goes up, I think it's N squared


00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.960
in terms of computing power and stuff.


00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.560
So yeah, it's very difficult.


00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.160
I mean, this is why, you know, like,


00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.480
running what we call cosmological simulations,


00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.840
where you simulate the entire universe,


00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.080
it's obviously very difficult.


00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.280
They take years to run.


00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.720
- You need a lot of RAM for that.


00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.560
- Mm-hmm, yeah.


00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.280
And then, obviously, this is what I was talking about before,


00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.080
where you have a nice 3D visualization.


00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.080
So this is of something called the Radcliffe wave,


00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:04.640
which was discovered this time last year.


00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.960
And it was something that was nearby


00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.440
to where the sun is in the Milky Way.


00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.920
So this is sort of like gas cloud positions,


00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.040
but until they plotted them in a 3D way


00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.520
so that you could drag around the data and overlay,


00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.720
okay, these are known positions of other things,


00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:24.720
and these are the shapes of, say, the spiral arms nearby,


00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.200
it was then that you could actually see


00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.280
spatially what was going on.


00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.480
They realized that this was actually a feature


00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.800
in the Milky Way, and so they can just drag it around


00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.400
and everything on Potley, so it's great to see.


00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.280
- Super cool.


00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.000
Yeah, so I kind of skipped you out of order your video,


00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.840
so there were simulations.


00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.680
- Sorry.


00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.520
- No, no, it's my fault.


00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.360
- They're kind of both the same.


00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.200
- Yeah, yeah.


00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.760
And there's data visualizations.


00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.880
And so this is just Plotly, right?


00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880
- Yeah, exactly.


00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.960
And it's tools like this, though, that like you say,


00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.880
oh, that seems obvious to plot something in 3D


00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.640
to see the spatial scale, but if the tool didn't exist,


00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.560
the tool didn't exist, you know?


00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.000
- Yeah, so as say somebody who's a scientist


00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.040
or just looking to visualize data,


00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.960
they just need to get it into basically


00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.880
like a NumPy array of data, throw it at Plotly,


00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.520
give it some colors, and it does all the visualization


00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.960
and the rotation and the zooming and that stuff, right?


00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.240
So it's more accessible than maybe it seems.


00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.480
- Yeah, and that's the thing is that it is very accessible.


00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.440
But what I love is that astronomy is driving forward


00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.600
a lot of these tools as well,


00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.960
'cause you were saying we need this.


00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.800
People often say like,


00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.000
why do we bother studying astronomy?


00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.120
Like, shouldn't we put money into other things?


00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.320
But I think one of the sort of indirect benefits


00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.080
is how much astronomy drives forward technology.


00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.320
Digital camera detectors were invented


00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.640
because astronomers needed a better way to record stuff.


00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.120
And Wi-Fi was massively improved


00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.880
because astronomers came up with a better way


00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.360
to recombine signals that have been scattered


00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.880
as they go around your house and stuff.


00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.920
And another thing is tools like this.


00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.440
And especially when we look towards a lot of the VR stuff


00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.760
that's coming out soon as well.


00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.440
So I'm thinking about like, you know,


00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.880
when you can put on a VR headset


00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.920
and you can be immersed in an image


00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.840
or anything like we have now.


00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.400
We like to call them 3D images.


00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.840
So we'll take an image of something


00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.160
at every single wavelength or wavelength steps, right?


00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:13.400
So from infrared to uv or from red colors to blue colors.


00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.560
And I said before, there's lots of different features


00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.760
that pop out of those things.


00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.440
So you can imagine actually being able to be immersed


00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.960
in that to actually see it for yourself


00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.200
rather than maybe doing it something like Plotly.


00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.520
Or you could also imagine there's a star called Eta Carina


00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.560
that we think is very close to supernova and collapse.


00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.280
And people have observed it for years


00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.080
and seen the big 3D structure of it


00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.600
and model the 3D structure.


00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:36.880
People have 3D printed it,


00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.080
but you can imagine being put in a VR environment


00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.880
and being able to fully, you know,


00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.360
move stuff around and get underneath things.


00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.960
- Walk around it, look under it.


00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.360
- Exactly, yeah.


00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.800
And sort of that kind of a tech is the kind of thing


00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.080
that I can really see a lot of science pushing forward.


00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.600
Like it having a use case,


00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.080
which at first it necessarily didn't in society,


00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.480
but science gave it a use case.


00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.800
And then all of a sudden it was developed.


00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.400
And then all of a sudden society realized


00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.520
another use case for it.


00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.720
And it snows, snowballs from there really.


00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.600
- Yeah, super neat, super neat.


00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.680
So that video covered the five things


00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.200
and then you interviewed your friend, your colleague,


00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.080
who also actually did more simulation work


00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.600
and analyzing and whatnot.


00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.440
So yeah, I recommend people check out that video.


00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.920
Of course it'll be in the show notes.


00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.160
Are you ready for some quick career advice


00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.600
before we move on? - Sure.


00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.440
- All right, so out here in the comments,


00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.080
would you recommend a computer science for A-level


00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.480
so it'll be easier to use code in university?


00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.760
What subjects would be best for astrophysics?


00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.360
- Yeah, I mean, computer science definitely


00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.160
won't hinder you in terms of science.


00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.200
Like I think it's great to sort of know


00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.400
about the ins and outs in computing.


00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.680
And you will do a lot of coding


00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.480
as part of a computer science A-level


00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.760
or whatever is the equivalent in your country.


00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.760
So that's sort of like the 17 to 18 year old


00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.040
that we do in the UK, the exams.


00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.960
Other subjects, obviously physics,


00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.240
obviously maths for sort of context.


00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.600
I, so we only do four subjects,


00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.680
maybe only three for our A-levels.


00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.560
We specialize very early in the UK,


00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.640
but I did physics, maths, chemistry, further maths,


00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.920
which is like extra maths.


00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.200
And like, that was just 'cause they were my favorite subjects


00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.680
and I knew that they were the ones


00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.840
that if I had a pile of homework,


00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.720
I'd be picking those off the top,


00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.560
rather than my English homework or whatever.


00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.760
- There'll be some essay buried underneath


00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.760
that's gotta get rid of. - Yes, exactly.


00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.040
And I'd be like, I'll do that later.


00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.240
And like future me would hate me


00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.600
'cause I'd put it off for too long.


00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.120
I'd be doing it the next day right before the class.


00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.880
And so that's, I did those and that was great


00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.640
because I got to university and,


00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.800
you know, the further maths helped


00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.160
'cause there was some I'd already seen.


00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.520
But like, I think when you're at school,


00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.520
it's often quite pressurized to feel like


00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.360
you have to know everything


00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.480
to either get into university or before university.


00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.840
But that's kind of the point of college or university


00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.120
is they're there to teach you these things.


00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.800
They don't expect you to know everything.


00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.400
So just give yourself the best, you know, platform


00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.920
to get into whatever subject you care about the most.


00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.400
So if you're considering a certain subject


00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.360
at a certain university,


00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.800
just check what their entry requirements are.


00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.280
If they're like, oh, actually we would need you


00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.560
to do computer science, then great, take computer science.


00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.120
But otherwise, you know, just take those subjects


00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.400
that you like the most is what I would say.


00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:18.400
- And then also another interesting question from Georgia.


00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.360
You know, we have been talking


00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.040
as we're just taking Jupyter for advantage.


00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.200
Jupyter's here so we just use that.


00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.440
But the question is, you know,


00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.480
was the Jupyter ecosystem a game changer


00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.600
for astronomy and training and your opinion?


00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.440
And in what way?


00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.440
I mean, I think it was for science.


00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.560
- Oh yeah, I mean, it didn't exist when I was learning


00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.000
and I think I would have picked it up a lot quicker


00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.280
if it had existed.


00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.680
I think because it's just a more familiar interface


00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.040
than being faced with a terminal or, you know, a blank.


00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.880
I used idle way back in the day, right?


00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:52.880
I looked like a blank idle, like empty, what's the word?


00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.040
File, thank you, brain finally came out.


00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.760
That's a long day at work.


00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.880
Yeah, I think it would have been a lot easier.


00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.560
And I do a lot of my tutorials and stuff like that


00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.040
that we share around colleagues.


00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.560
And I also like right now I've got,


00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.760
we read a paper the other day,


00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.160
we were like, this is really cool.


00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.560
We could test that.


00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.480
It would be a really quick plot if we just made it.


00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.000
So I've done that in Jupyter Notebooks.


00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.320
I've been like, and I've been like, you know,


00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.000
marked down being like, we read this paper,


00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.120
here's the length of the paper.


00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.920
Like we had this idea, so let's test it.


00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.680
Here's the data, here's the plot we make


00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.800
and here's what I think it means.


00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.000
And I'm gonna share it to my colleagues


00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.680
and they'll read it through so much more easily


00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.560
than if I'd sent an email with an embedded PDF


00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.400
or something, right?


00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.720
- A lot of times you send the picture,


00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.440
but obviously you don't necessarily send the code


00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.280
and people are like, well, what is this?


00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.680
What does this mean?


00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.240
Like, are you sending the same thing I'm sending?


00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.400
Like, yeah, it really is combined those


00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.040
in interesting ways, I think.


00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.600
- Yeah, and I think it really was a game changer,


00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.440
especially for astronomy,


00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.560
just because astronomy is such a visual science


00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.880
that seeing both the code and the images next to each other


00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.120
and what each step physically did to the image,


00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.080
you know, like I was talking about before,


00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.960
like removing all the sources of noise and all that stuff,


00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.360
that is so helpful in Jupyter.


00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.000
- Yeah, fantastic.


00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.280
All right, well, we're getting a little bit


00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.560
near the end of our time here,


00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.320
so I wanna wrap it up with one thing


00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.720
that I think is also worth giving a shout out to.


00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.800
And then you did a nice video,


00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.680
an astrophysicist reacts to funny space memes.


00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.360
So I'm gonna, we'll close it out with that,


00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.000
but you also wrote a cool book


00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.520
that came out pretty recently, right?


00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.600
Called "Space, 10 Things You Should Know."


00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.440
You wanna tell people about that?


00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.360
- Yes, yeah, sure.


00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.720
So it's "Space, 10 Things You Should Know"


00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.720
is the title in the UK,


00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.600
and "Space at the Speed of Light"


00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.560
is the title in North America and Canada.


00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.520
So "Space, 10 Things You Should Know"


00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.360
everywhere else in the world.


00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.800
- Yeah, that's why I'm in the UK,


00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.320
I'm as I'm when I pulled it up.


00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.160
- Yeah, sure.


00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.040
So it's about, it's sort of like 10 short essays


00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.520
on the things that I feel like you should know


00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.280
if you're wanting to either dip your toe in astronomy


00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.840
or you know, you have someone who's loved it for a long time


00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.800
but wants to make sure that they like, you know,


00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.040
do I really know this stuff?


00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.640
You know, if you were going to a dinner party


00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.160
with a bunch of astronomers,


00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.040
like these are the,


00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.080
like you'd want this sort of like base knowledge


00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.920
to be like, oh, I get what they're talking about.


00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.160
- How much differential equations do I need to know?


00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.720
- There's none, absolutely none.


00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.240
It's written, so it's written with my,


00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.920
like I'm talking to my mom basically.


00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.020
So my mom is intelligent, but not necessarily educated.


00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.280
So she didn't, she's finished school at 16.


00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:24.040
So she didn't have the privilege of an education like I did.


00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.960
She just started work straight away.


00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.320
And so she's so curious about space and the universe.


00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.440
Like I think a lot of people are.


00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.360
And so I wrote it with her in mind of being like, okay,


00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.920
what would my mom understand if I said to her, you know,


00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.860
and she loved the book.


00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.800
So I take that as a good thing.


00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.400
So, oh, Freya, thank you.


00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.240
- Yeah, Freya says my favorite book as well.


00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.520
- That's so nice.


00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.760
Yay.


00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.040
But yeah, so it's, I really enjoyed writing it.


00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.260
It's nice and short, so it's not too intimidating


00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.700
if you don't wanna read a big long book about space,


00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.300
but there's everything from like, okay,


00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.020
like why do we think dark matter exists, for example,


00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.980
but like could aliens exist?


00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:02.100
And also like the things we still don't know as well,


00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:02.940
which I like.


00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.580
So I like to think about that.


00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.660
- It seems like everything is known.


00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.500
You look at it so much.


00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.340
- But no.


00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.420
- But no.


00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.540
- No, there's so much more that we don't know.


00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:12.500
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.420
- Yeah, exactly.


00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:14.580
- Fantastic.


00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:18.200
All right, so I wanna do not the same memes,


00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.040
but I wanna kind of round this out just as a fun,


00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.040
like let's do the memes.


00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.720
Let me, I've hidden this on our screen share, so.


00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.560
(laughing)


00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.240
- So I couldn't see what you were planning.


00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.080
- You couldn't jump ahead, but all right.


00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.080
- I'm excited.


00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.560
- All right, so I'll pull up a couple of memes here,


00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.760
and I'll try to describe these to the listeners


00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.880
'cause almost everyone's just listening.


00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.720
- Sure.


00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.960
- But yeah, so setting the stage here,


00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:45.660
on yours, this is kind of a sneaker educational video


00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:46.500
that you did, right?


00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.320
- Yes.


00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.540
- You did the meme, but then you talked about the science.


00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.700
- Yeah, people were commenting like,


00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:51.860
"I clicked for a meme review,


00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:53.400
"and now I've come away with more knowledge


00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.460
"than any physics class I ever took."


00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.820
(laughing)


00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:59.060
It's like a sneak attack.


00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.500
- Exactly, all right, we go through these pretty quick.


00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.420
I'll try to describe them.


00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.340
All right, so the first one,


00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:09.300
we've got, remember Elon Musk shot at SpaceX,


00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.660
shot his Tesla Roadster and put a camera on its space


00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.020
and was flying along, but actually,


00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:17.260
this is around the same time that Apple Maps came out,


00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.820
and it was really bad.


00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.140
So the meme is, it's Earth in the background


00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:23.740
with the Tesla flying through the air.


00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.000
It says, "Stupid Apple Maps."


00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.020
(laughing)


00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.500
- I love that, I love it.


00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.820
'Cause it really, you know what, I miss Google Earth.


00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.700
Can we bring, is Google Earth still a thing?


00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.180
I feel like when that came out,


00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:39.220
we spent so long zooming out and seeing the entire Earth,


00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.700
and then all we do is just zoom in to our house.


00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.820
(laughing)


00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:43.660
- Exactly.


00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.500
- All the way from the whole neighborhood.


00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.700
- I'm like, I wonder where that high control ended,


00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.060
and I went along it for so far, yeah.


00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:52.060
- Yeah, but yeah, I feel like Apple Maps was just so,


00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:53.860
it wasn't intuitive with the zoom,


00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:54.900
and you could end up just like,


00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.780
oh God, I can see the entirety of Europe right now.


00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:58.620
- Exactly.


00:52:58.620 --> 00:52:59.740
- I don't need that.


00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:01.460
- All right, next one.


00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:04.040
There's an otter carrying two little tubes.


00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.580
(laughing)


00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:06.540
Shooting along, he says,


00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:08.660
"He needs those parts for his spaceship.


00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.340
"He's going to otter space."


00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.780
- I kind of wish that I studied black holes


00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:13.780
in otter space now,


00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:16.540
'cause I feel like they would be cuter for one thing.


00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.900
(laughing)


00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.380
Also infinitely cool.


00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.060
- Yeah, all right, next one.


00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:25.140
You touched on this, you talked about the Wi-Fi.


00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.380
So I have no idea why there's a seal here,


00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:29.460
but it says, "NASA receives data


00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.500
"from over 17.3 billion kilometers away."


00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.860
I lose the Wi-Fi signal in my own bathroom.


00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.500
(laughing)


00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.340
- But that's the thing though,


00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:39.180
the techniques that are developed


00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:42.580
to recombine all the scattered signals


00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.660
from 17.3 billion kilometers away


00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:47.720
are the same ones that are used to recombine your Wi-Fi,


00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:52.720
but apparently brick walls are better disrupting them


00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.580
than the Earth's atmosphere is.


00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.420
- Yeah, the magnetic field,


00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.980
17 billion kilometers, all that, awesome.


00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.820
- Yeah.


00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:01.640
- All right, a couple more.


00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.980
- Also, NASA's detectors are much more sensitive


00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:04.820
than your phone detectors.


00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.940
- Yeah, that's true.


00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.580
- You wouldn't wanna carry that around.


00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.820
All right, so this one is a different kind of eclipses.


00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:13.140
So we've got the moon, the Earth, and the sun,


00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:14.740
and it tries to show you what the difference


00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.560
between a lunar and a solar eclipse is.


00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.100
So it has moon, Earth, sun, it says lunar eclipse.


00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.100
It has Earth, moon, sun, solar eclipse,


00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:25.700
and then it has Earth, sun, moon, apocalypse.


00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.100
- Apocalypse, that's great.


00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:30.380
It's so, so good, I love it so much.


00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.500
- Yeah, that's a good one.


00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.340
All right, what else?


00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.220
- You can never see the moon, that'd be so sad.


00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.540
- All right, so here's a picture


00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.300
of a traditional alien like E.T.,


00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.380
and it says, "Here's a creature capable


00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:44.160
of intergalactic space travel, steals a cow."


00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.820
(both laughing)


00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.860
- And the thing is, people justify this as like,


00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.180
well, the cow population is greater


00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:53.500
than the human population,


00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.460
therefore they will have assumed.


00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.100
I was like, if they go by that,


00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:59.700
they'll be abducting loads of chickens.


00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:00.540
- Exactly.


00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.880
- It's so crazy.


00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.580
- This one made me laugh really hard, I like this one.


00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:05.420
All right, another one?


00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.380
- I mean, I would love aliens to be real,


00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.740
but I doubt that we'll ever make


00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.100
that kind of contact with them.


00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.540
- Exactly, exactly.


00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:14.380
I do think they probably are out there,


00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:15.540
but they're far, far away.


00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:18.060
All right, so this one is really close to your research.


00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:20.100
It's a black hole, and then there's stuff around it,


00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:20.940
but you can see nothing in the black hole.


00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:22.500
It says, "What happens in a black hole


00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.580
stays in a black hole."


00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.100
- Yeah. - Kind of like Las Vegas.


00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:27.620
- I mean, that is like the most physics-accurate meme


00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:28.620
we've had so far.


00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:32.060
- Yeah, I tried to find a few science-y ones.


00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.020
And then let's see what's the last one here.


00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.660
Oh yeah, this one has the moon,


00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:37.780
which is just a picture of the moon,


00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:38.980
and then the dark side of the moon,


00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:42.220
he's dressed up like the emperor from "Star Wars."


00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:44.820
- Palpatine, yeah. - Yeah, Palpatine, exactly.


00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.660
- That's so cute.


00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:49.100
I want a little, do you remember they made,


00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:52.140
NASA made a load of little plushy teddy bear things


00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:54.900
of the planets and all of their little satellites


00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:58.420
a while ago, and now I want the dark side of the moon


00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:00.780
as a little plushy toy.


00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:03.420
But people get so confused with the dark side of the moon


00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:04.620
and the far side of the moon,


00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.460
'cause the far side of the moon is the moon


00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:09.660
that we can't see, because it's what's called tidally locked


00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:11.900
so only one side of the moon ever faces us.


00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.100
But that's not the dark side of the moon,


00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:19.300
'cause when we have a new moon, or a solar eclipse,


00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.660
the far side of the moon is lit up.


00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.380
So people get so confused. - Exactly, 'cause we never


00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.220
see the dark side of the moon.


00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.740
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.


00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:27.340
- Yeah, it is confusing.


00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.380
But still a good meme.


00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:30.100
All right, those were fun, thanks.


00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.220
(both laughing)


00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:32.380
- They're great. - Yeah, yeah.


00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:36.220
- All right, so final two questions of the show.


00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.940
If you're gonna write some Python code,


00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:40.820
what editor do you use?


00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:42.940
- VS Code, I love VS Code.


00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.660
VS Code, it only just pipped out Atom.


00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.020
Like, I was using Atom, and then I started using VS Code.


00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:51.620
Command + D in VS Code, basically you can highlight


00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:56.100
a parameter you've defined, and then it picks out


00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:59.020
all of the other times you've mentioned that parameter


00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.180
in your script.


00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:01.580
And you're like, oh, I wanna change the name,


00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.140
and if you start typing it, it'll just change it everywhere.


00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.940
And like, the biggest joy I ever felt was discovering


00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.780
that that was a thing.


00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:11.100
- Why is this named, I don't wanna change it.


00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.820
Wait, it's so easy to change.


00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:15.100
- Yes, yeah, exactly, it's great.


00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:17.700
- Yeah, and I suspect you probably throw Jupyter in there


00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.340
as well as a lot of, right, but not properly.


00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.500
- Yeah, yeah. - Those are kind of


00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.780
more exploration.


00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.580
- Yeah, if I was doing something that I was gonna share


00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.060
with colleagues, I'd do it on Jupyter.


00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:29.780
So the final stage where I would visualize my data


00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.740
in a plot, or I'd be able to write something out


00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.860
as an argument, I'd do it in Jupyter as well.


00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:39.380
But if I'm doing model fitting, or if I'm doing a lot


00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:43.940
of heavy sort of image analysis, I will do it in a script


00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.140
in VS Code.


00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.240
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.


00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.500
I think there's just different ways of working.


00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.340
Are you trying to build something that you can reuse


00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:53.140
and kind of create a little library out of,


00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:54.940
or are you trying to explore and you don't really know


00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:55.780
where you're going yet, right?


00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.860
- Exactly, yeah, I'd use Jupyter for doing that as well,


00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.820
being like, okay, I have this data table, it's brand new,


00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.060
let's get to grips with it.


00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:03.340
And I'll do that in Jupyter again,


00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.320
'cause it's just so visual to be able to grab stuff


00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.740
more easily and be like, hmm, let's plot this against this


00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:08.940
and see if there's something there.


00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:10.420
Like I'll do that in Jupyter.


00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:13.400
Rather than like a, I used to do it in an IPython terminal,


00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.700
but it's just so much more visual.


00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:16.980
- Yeah, it'll pop up a little window or whatever,


00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:18.060
yeah, exactly.


00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.260
- Yeah, well, that's another thing I love about VS Code


00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:23.620
is that when I then write up my papers, so I use LaTeX,


00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.260
which is another programming language.


00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:30.500
VS Code can run the LaTeX script for you.


00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.500
- Oh, nice, it basically compiles it to that.


00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.260
- Yeah, so it can also do the same with Python as well.


00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.020
You can highlight a little section


00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.740
and get it to run in a terminal as well


00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:42.460
with like shift enter, like you do in a Jupyter notebook.


00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:43.300
- Oh, yeah, okay.


00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:46.300
- Yeah, so it's just great, it's just great.


00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:47.540
- Fantastic.


00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.660
All right, and then final question.


00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:53.660
There's almost 300,000 different packages out on PyPI,


00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.540
and that's sort of the part of the beauty of Python, right,


00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:01.300
is just you can go grab these things and bring them in,


00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:05.260
but what one maybe you've come across you wanna recommend?


00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:06.780
- Yeah, so I was trying to think of something


00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.580
that would be applicable to everyone


00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:10.380
and not just someone in astronomy,


00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.100
and my immediate thought, and I can't deny it,


00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.660
it's been one of the most useful packages ever to me,


00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:20.660
is MCEE, E-M-C-E-E, by Daniel Formamacki,


00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:22.540
who is an astronomer as well,


00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:27.260
and it's a module that codes up Bayesian analysis,


00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:31.220
like Monte Carlo, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, so MCMC,


00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:35.700
and it's essentially like an optimization package,


00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.420
you know, like a sci-fi optimized or something like that,


00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.500
but it uses Bayesian statistics to do it


00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.460
and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo,


00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.980
so it's a really sophisticated way of optimizing,


00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.700
but also getting sort of like,


00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.060
like, okay, you fit at this model, this is your best fit,


00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:50.580
but this is how uncertain this model is as well,


00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:51.580
is what it gives you,


00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:55.060
and it's just so like ready and out of the box,


00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:58.740
it's so well documented, it runs great,


00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.460
and it's just, I just can't fault it,


01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.460
like, that's the thing, - Yeah, that's awesome.


01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.300
- and Dan is just like the coolest person,


01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.340
he's like, he's just like,


01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:08.700
he taught me so much Python when I was a PhD student


01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:12.100
and he was sort of like a senior PhD student as well,


01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.580
and he has an accent very similar to yours, actually,


01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:15.540
he's definitely from,


01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.820
I think he's from the Pacific Northwest,


01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.100
but I don't wanna say that in case I got it wrong,


01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.340
and he's like, "No."


01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:20.180
(laughing)


01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.620
- He's from Southern California.


01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.860
- Yeah, exactly, but he's an accent like yours,


01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:27.460
and so I associate that sort of like really sort of like,


01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:30.500
very sort of like slow, not slow, that sounds bad,


01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.340
but you know what I mean,


01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.300
that sort of like cadence to an American accent.


01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.700
- Yeah, to whatever, yeah, uh-huh.


01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.100
- Yeah, exactly, like I associate that with just like,


01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.900
okay, I'm gonna teach you this cool thing about Python,


01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.540
(laughing)


01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.580
like hold your hand through it, so, yeah,


01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.060
it's a great, great package,


01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.340
if you're doing anything to do with like model fitting


01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.700
or Bayesian stats or anything like that,


01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.460
I would like 100% recommend.


01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.620
- Awesome, yeah, that's not something I've tried yet,


01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.180
'cause I haven't had to use that,


01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.620
but it sounds really, really useful.


01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.100
Just as a funny story, since you brought up accents,


01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.260
so for like 10 years or so,


01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:04.060
I did professional development,


01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.180
like training, I'd go to a company or somewhere,


01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.980
do like a week-long in-person course,


01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.140
and I did this one in Beijing,


01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:14.180
and I think the students were nervous


01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:18.180
that I would come, maybe with like a broad Scottish accent


01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.260
or something, it'd be very hard to understand,


01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.860
and at the end of the course,


01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.260
everyone had to write a little review


01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.900
for the company I was working for,


01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.500
and like, what did you think of Michael as a teacher?


01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:32.460
And then the company, they would go through and review


01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.900
if there's any weird comments,


01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.980
like, oh, what happened to this course, like why did it go,


01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:38.140
tell us about why this weird, you know,


01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.380
people were unhappy or they're,


01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.380
you know, what did you do to make them so happy or whatever,


01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:44.180
and the comment was just this,


01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.260
Michael has a very good tongue.


01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.460
(laughing)


01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.940
And they're like, you're gonna need to explain this.


01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:50.780
What is going on?


01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.620
I'm like--


01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:52.980
- Was it a mis-translation?


01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.820
- Yeah, yeah, it was like, he has a good accent,


01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.140
like he speaks clearly and like whatever.


01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:57.980
- Yeah.


01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.380
- But it was just like the way, on paper,


01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.620
the way they ended up with, they contacted me,


01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.460
like, Michael, you need to tell me what's going on here.


01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.300
- I love that.


01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.780
My accent confuses people massively


01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:11.660
because I was like brought up in the Northwest of England,


01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.980
but my mom's family are all from the Northeast of England,


01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.340
so it's this odd smush,


01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.980
and then most Americans haven't really heard


01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.580
a Northern accent, or if they have,


01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.860
it's like, Sean Bean, you know?


01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.820
(laughing)


01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.020
Let's take the hobbits to my city.


01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.140
(laughing)


01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.540
If that's all they've ever heard,


01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:28.740
that's another Lord of the Rings reference,


01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.580
God, they're flying today.


01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.140
And so, yeah, and then I've spent obviously a lot of time


01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.180
in the South of England now since I've moved,


01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.500
and my accents have to soften


01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.900
because academia and science in general


01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.220
is such a global thing, you know,


01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.460
so many people with so many different cultures


01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.380
and accents coming together,


01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.140
that if I talked in my normal one,


01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.380
I think a lot of people ask me to repeat things


01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:53.220
so many times that it softens and it gets more,


01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:55.220
I enunciate things more now,


01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.500
which makes me sound posher, which I don't like.


01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.140
(laughing)


01:02:59.140 --> 01:02:59.980
But never mind.


01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:02.260
- Yeah, how funny.


01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:07.660
All right, so what a great conversation.


01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:08.980
Thanks for being here, Dr. Becky.


01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.780
It's, you know, like I said, you're doing great work.


01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.020
People should certainly check out your YouTube channel


01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.420
and what you're doing there.


01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.900
You're doing a lot of cool work to popularize science


01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.260
in a super accessible way.


01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.260
So final call to action,


01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:21.740
people are interested in what you're doing.


01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.540
Maybe they wanna, you know, get Python into their astronomy


01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.060
or maybe they wanna get into astronomy.


01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:29.060
What's your final call to action for listeners?


01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.340
- Install Astrobyte.


01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.820
I think it's a simple pip, install Astrobyte to get into


01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:35.740
and check out all their documentation as well.


01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:39.500
And, you know, do as much physics and maths as you can


01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:43.820
and get involved with Galaxy Zoo and Planet Hunters online


01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.540
'cause all those kind of clicks end up


01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:46.900
in scientific research papers


01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.940
and they thank the participants as well.


01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:51.060
So it's a great endeavor to be involved in.


01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.460
- Yeah, and one question on the way out,


01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.420
you know, someone was asking if they can read your,


01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:56.620
can the public read your papers?


01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.060
Do you have to be part of a journal subscription?


01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.940
- No, so all astronomy papers get posted


01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.780
on something called the Archive, A-R-X-I-V.


01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.300
No, Astro-P-H on the Archive.


01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.580
And so they're all free to read.


01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.700
So you should be able to find them that way.


01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.660
They're all listed from my public website as well, actually.


01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.460
So you should be able to find them there.


01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.860
- Yeah, fantastic.


01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.820
All right, well, thank you so much for being here.


01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.060
And it's been really fun to have you on the show.


01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:21.900
- Thanks for having me.


01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:22.900
Have fun. - Yeah.
