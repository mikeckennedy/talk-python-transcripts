00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.200
Brett, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.340
Well, thank you very much for having me.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.020
It's awesome to have you here.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.860
A pair of Kennedys on the show.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.740
First time ever.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.860
That's pretty awesome.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.780
Yep.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.340
Well, it should be much more common.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.380
Indeed.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.600
Well, thank you for coming on the show.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.500
I'm really interested to talk some data science and mathy type things with Python.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:34.320
Python is being used for data science and analysis and just general science and mathematics so much these days.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.960
I wonder if people have maybe a perception out there thinking, well, Python is kind of like, yeah, people use that for the web and stuff.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.160
And true.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.100
But these days, it's data science, machine learning, those things, right?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.360
Yeah.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.200
I mean, other languages are used a fair amount.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.640
Statistical analysis are.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.720
Mm-hmm.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.320
They're still used.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.260
Information.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.360
Machine learning.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.700
People will look at other languages.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.080
C++ is used a lot.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.020
And like Mojo and things are coming through now that are.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.100
But still, a very, very large percent is done in Python.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.640
All that work we're seeing with large language models, for example.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.840
Like, you know, that's pretty much all Python.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.920
And a lot of, you know, standard, you know, traditional machine learning.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.480
It's done in, a very large portion of it's done in Python, yeah.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.620
Yeah.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.200
And outlier detection as well.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.140
Yeah.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.620
Yeah.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.940
Yeah.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:44.240
I think Python is probably, I mean, arguably, but I think probably the richest set of tools for outlier detection of any language.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.540
Again, you know, R has quite a good suite.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.340
And you get good, you know, good Java and other places.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.180
But Python is probably where you find the strongest, just the sheer number of them.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:10.440
And also, you know, it covers a lot of, you know, the deep learning techniques and, you know, some kind of approaches to outlier detection.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.900
Yeah.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.060
Yeah.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.660
Awesome.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.760
Well, we're going to dive into it.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.900
You've written a whole book on it and a bunch of cool techniques you pulled out.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.380
We're going to talk about some libraries and things like that, as well as some other examples.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.720
But before we get into that, let's just hear a quick introduction about who you are and what you do these days.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.220
Sure.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.800
Yeah.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.460
Yes.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.940
Well, my name is Brett Kennedy.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.740
So I've worked in software in one capacity or another for about 30 years now.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.920
I did my master's degree quite a long time ago at the University of Toronto.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.440
And I was actually well, I was around 98, 99.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.380
So during one of the times when AI was maybe a bit of a winter.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.380
And yeah, that was a very, very good experience going there.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.780
And yeah, I've worked for one company doing software that was used for financial auditing.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.500
So, and that's where I really started to get into data science.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.180
And that was about 15 years ago.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.000
Kind of, you know, when it's a little bit, not as mainstream as it is today.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.320
I mean, there's certainly a lot of other people doing it, but it wasn't, you know, the gigantic industry that it is now.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:46.280
Yeah, there's definitely some inflection points or places where it's really taken some steps, significant steps up in the Python data science and ML space.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.020
Probably one is the Pandas NumPy era around 2006.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.440
Something around 2012.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.820
I don't know really what caused that.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.580
And certainly the machine learning AI is a whole nother spike of growth there.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.300
So you were doing, it was kind of before mainstream data science, right?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.020
Yeah.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.980
I mean, it was starting to become mainstream.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:19.420
But like when working with text, for example, you know, there's certain, you know, there's spaCy and Word2Vac and Glove and things like that.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.760
But, you know, this is long before GPT.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.820
But, you know, Psychic Learn existed.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.940
And this was cool.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.520
Yeah.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.660
So we're actually using a lot of the same tools that you would use now.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.440
But, you know, there are a little bit earlier versions of them.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.560
Yeah.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.860
Sure.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.880
You know, yeah.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.340
So things have progressed certainly a lot.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.260
Though, you know, some things just work and have been fairly stable.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.460
Yeah.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:55.600
And in that space, you know, I imagine a lot of the work that's been done on the faster CPython initiative is probably paying benefits.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.360
Yeah.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.880
I mean, one of the things about Python is it does have a reputation as being not the fastest language you can use.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.700
Now, you know, old versions of Python were certainly slower.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.140
It is getting faster.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.260
Yeah.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.800
C++ is probably about as performant as you can get.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.460
But, you know, a lot of like Psychic Learn, for example, is, you know, uses Cython.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.800
So you get, you know, C code.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.540
Yeah.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.260
See, you get.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.180
Yeah.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.780
Yeah.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.480
It also goes back to, you know, what are you measuring?

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.280
What is your metric for fast?

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.240
Yeah.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.560
What are your expectations?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.140
And yeah.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.940
Yeah.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.060
Yeah.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:47.420
And I could make a really fast thing in two weeks in C++ or I could make a somewhat slower thing but get you the answer in half a day in Python.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.300
Mm-hmm.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.200
It might run five times longer.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.460
But you'll have the answer today.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.940
You know what I mean?

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.640
Like that kind of thing.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.920
Yes.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.300
Yeah.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.740
Yeah.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.860
Yeah.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.500
There's really a trade-off.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:09.280
And I think, I mean, it's kind of the, well, it's really the approach we've taken in data science is to really privilege the data scientist's time over the computation time.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.520
Yeah.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.580
Yeah.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.780
Yeah.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.640
And when it really does become a problem, there's a lot of stuff written in C or Rust or whatever, you know, Polars, Pandas, et cetera.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.800
Yeah.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.420
Yeah.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.300
Yeah.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.380
Yeah.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.520
Yeah.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.520
Yeah.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.300
Yeah.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.100
Are you a fan of Polars?

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.740
I've been using it.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.400
I use it when there's a need.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.600
I mean, I'm still a big fan of Pandas and I still use it quite a lot.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:36.580
But when there's a performance issue, yeah, Polars is one of the things I'll turn to.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.780
Okay.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.780
Yeah.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.760
Yeah.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.080
Excellent.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.660
So we're going to talk about outlier detection.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:53.320
And I think maybe a good way to sort of introduce this topic is to maybe understand the problem space just a tiny bit.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:07:03.500
Because sometimes you might think, well, if the mean is really weird or the median is really weird or something like that, then we might have an outlier.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.460
We can go check it out.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.280
But it's really a lot more subtle than that.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:13.880
And I want to maybe go back to a guest I had six months ago or something like that, Stephanie Molin.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.100
And she has this really cool project called Datamorph, which I'll link to on GitHub.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.300
And we talked about it then.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:31.600
But if you pull up her GitHub repo, it's an animated GIF, I believe, of a whole bunch of different very clear concrete shapes, like a star, literally a panda.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.880
Not pandas, but the animal.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.140
And continuous animation, a bunch of data points that go from one to the other.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.300
And it shows the mean over time.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.440
It's the same.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.420
The standard deviation is the same.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.060
The correlation, the same, effectively, to like, you know, four to the thousandth sort of thing.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:08:00.680
And it just shows you this is not as simple as finding stuff that's just off the linear interpolation line or something like that, right?

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.000
Yeah.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.580
Yeah.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.340
It's a good example.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:09.640
Using a single or a handful of metrics to evaluate a data set can be a bit oversimplistic.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.240
You can miss a lot of nuance when you do that.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.540
Yeah.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:14.820
Yeah.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.220
And you do definitely get into the same sort of issues when you're looking at outliers.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:26.280
And a lot of areas of data science where you can kind of mislead by looking at metrics that maybe, you know, are relevant.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.300
But, you know, just don't tell the full story.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.740
Right.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.620
It's one view, but maybe it's not.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.060
It doesn't, for sure, like you said, it doesn't tell the whole story.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.840
So let's talk about, you know, what is this outlier detection stuff?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.460
And really, you know, why do people care?

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.560
What kind of problems are being solved with it and so on?

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.800
Right.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.060
Right.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:51.460
Yeah.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:09:06.500
I mean, you know, often when people start to learn machine learning, you know, one of the early things you'll learn is, you know, there's supervised machine learning and there's unsupervised machine learning.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.800
You know, the two bigger areas of it are probably clustering and outlier detection.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:17.000
And there's, you know, sometimes dimensionality reduction is kind of considered unsupervised as well.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.820
So, you know, there's kind of a whole host.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.020
It's kind of like there's a whole host of reasons you might want to do clustering.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.940
It's a little bit like that.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:33.360
It's just one of those things that turns up time and again when you're doing machine learning.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.340
Yeah.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.900
So, yeah.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:45.160
Outlier detection can be done for, for example, if you have a data set and you just want to say you just want to try and understand the data.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.040
You know.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:52.500
There's really kind of two main parts to that.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.980
There's, you know, what are trying to figure out what are the general patterns in the data and what are the exceptions to those?

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:07.480
And once you, you know, have both of those, you say, well, here's the patterns and here's the extent to which those patterns hold true in the data, which is the outliers.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.560
That kind of gives you a good sense of what the data is.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.420
When you're checking for data quality, outlier tests are very useful.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:25.200
It gives you, like if you have, say, a table of, well, whatever it is, credit card transactions or whatever.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.700
You can do this for image data or audio data or, you know, data of really any type.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.080
But let's take a simple example of tabular data.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:41.040
You might have a, you know, spreadsheet with a few million rows of credit card transactions or, you know, SQL table.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:51.780
If you want to check it for errors, you know, before you go on to do other sort of analysis, either data mining or building predictive models or the like.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:57.040
You know, one thing we often do is try and see, well, what kind of data quality am I dealing with here?

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.060
So, and there's a number of ways to do that.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:11.500
But one of the steps you might often perform is say, well, do outlier detection and see, you know, what are the strangest rows in my data?

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.860
Because you see the strangest credit card transactions in there.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:27.080
Or if you could be a little more involved analysis, you might look at, you know, the most unusual string of transactions for a given user or a given store or something like that.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:39.220
And if you say, well, okay, weird is only this weird, then, you know, you can have some sort of sense of what sort of range of anomalousness might be in your data.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.280
But yes, it's used, outlier detection is used a lot as well in security.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:50.840
Where would it be used like checking for fraud, checking for errors?

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.240
I mean, it's used in scientific analysis a lot.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:05.580
But, you know, it's very common for scientific projects for just, you know, collect data, you know, through sensors or, you know, hand collecting data or whatever.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.480
Case of astronomy, it's, you know, through telescopes.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.880
Yeah.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:19.220
You know, we just collect, you know, well, astronomy is a good example where we collect such phenomenal volumes of data that if you want to find anything interesting in there.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:26.460
You know, we used to be able to find interesting phenomena in astronomy data just by manually going through it.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:31.580
You know, one example given the book is that's how pulsars were discovered.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:32.960
Mm-hmm.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:32.960
Mm-hmm.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:39.480
probably.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:50.340
So to, to really find something really, really interesting, given that you, you know, we might collect, you know, petabytes of data per night.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:13:02.880
Really, the most effective way is just go, an anomaly, run an anomaly detection on the data and say, you know, what are the strangest things in this set of data?

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.340
And those are, you know, odds are those are going to be the most interesting things there.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:14.500
You know, maybe things we've never seen before or haven't seen, you know, a whole lot.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:15.600
Yeah.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.600
At least some examples.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.660
Yeah.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.920
Yeah.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.840
I do want to point.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.540
A lot of my video games as well as, oh, sorry about that.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.380
Oh, no.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:41.840
When I talked to Sarah Eisen about imaging a black, the black hole, the first black hole image with Python, they, she talked about shipping, actually shipping hard drives around to sync up the data because there was so much data that it was faster.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.220
So much data.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.460
Put it onto a plane and send it from all the different locations around the world.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.320
It literally couldn't keep up the internet.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.960
And so they are like, all right, we're going to just box them up into these big crates and ship them around.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.880
That's, that's when you're talking that much data, you got to get a plane involved.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.140
It's, it's pretty wild.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.660
Yeah.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.020
Yeah.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.680
We had that.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.920
We had, we weren't doing anomaly detection at the time, but yeah, one of the companies I've worked with just dealing with financial data.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.540
It was actually, we actually collected so much.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.860
It's actually faster to mail it.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.500
Really?

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.140
You did.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.220
You ended up doing that as well.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.420
Yeah.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:15.820
Yeah.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.380
At times.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:16.580
Yeah.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:16.920
Yeah.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.660
How much of a hard drive would you put in the mail?

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.980
It wouldn't be just a terabyte.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.480
It would have to be a pretty big hard drive or set of hard drives, right?

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.660
Yeah.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.900
Well, part of the explanation of why we're doing this was, this was about 15 years ago.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.420
I see.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:31.800
I think.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.780
A terabyte sounds like a whole lot.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.200
Yeah.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.360
Yeah.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.240
Yeah.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:43.520
I think the internet we were paying for at the time was, you know, having sort of speeds we have the internet now was, you know, the costs were prohibitive back then.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.400
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:51.780
I've gigabit up and down at home for 75 bucks, which, you know, you could have sent it over that probably.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.660
Yeah.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.360
Yeah.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.760
It's not quite back when the internet had a sound.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.700
Do you remember when the internet had a sound?

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.800
I do remember.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.220
You would connect to it and you would be like, okay, that's a good connection.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.280
We're going to have some stuff happening today.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.080
Yes.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.160
Yeah.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.320
Yeah.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:07.360
Yeah.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.720
But that's, that's early nineties when the internet stopped having a sound.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.340
Mid nineties.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:11.960
All right.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.300
It stopped.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:12.580
Yeah.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.060
Yeah.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:18.020
That's about when I first started getting a little, just as it's kind of being opened up.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.900
Yeah.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.340
Yeah.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.420
I remember the early days.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.480
It was basically university students that were on there.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:36.160
We would, what I would do when I was in high school is I would, my brothers, my brother and I, we would call the local university and they had a library dial up for dial up modems.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.260
And then you get onto Telnet and go for an Archie.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.700
This is before the worldwide web existed, right?

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.440
Before Mosaic.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.160
Oh, yeah.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:44.420
Yeah.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:44.620
Yeah.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.260
Yeah.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:45.600
Yeah.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.080
Yeah.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.360
And for people that know what I'm talking about.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:48.540
Yeah.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.240
Yeah.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:49.660
Exactly.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.420
Telnet.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:50.740
Yes.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.000
Yeah.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.320
Encrypted FTP, by the way, we had so much trust.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.080
We were so naive, but yeah, when you would connect, it would go.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.520
And depending on the sound, you would get to where you would go.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.380
Oh, that means I connected this bit rate or that bit rate.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:07.640
Right.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.620
It's so wild.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:08.960
Yep.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.500
I'm nostalgic for it.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.860
I want nothing to do with it.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.400
I'm so happy we are where we are.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.260
Yeah.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.860
Yeah.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.900
There's a certain charm to it, but.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.900
But if you went back to it, you would hate it.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.860
Yeah.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.640
I think now.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.140
You would watch the images load.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.980
You would almost see the progressive scan lines come in.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.820
I mean, it was really, it wasn't ideal.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.740
No.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.260
I had a roommate once who used to download images.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:40.460
These are just the same JPEGs, the same sort of files we have today.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.860
But it would take literally overnight to download a JPEG.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.560
Incredible.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.240
Yeah.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.980
Well, they were interesting times, but we've certainly moved on.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.060
So that's, that's all good.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:17:01.300
Now, I think you talked about some examples where you're looking for outliers for fraud,

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.300
like credit card.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.680
You talked about mailing around the financial data for those kinds of things.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:15.660
I think it seems to me that outliers might also reveal new science or new information that you didn't expect.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.680
Like it's an outlier because it doesn't match our model.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.360
Yep.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.620
But something is happening over here.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.380
And I think, you know, you pointed out astronomy, right?

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.500
Like that part is really bizarrely bright.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.080
Why is that so bright?

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.660
Is that a, you know, oh, that's a quasar.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.400
That's what that is.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.420
Yeah.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:30.980
So yeah.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.940
Brightness, you're not expecting or a shape of a galaxy.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.220
You're not expecting that sort of thing.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:34.380
Right.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.520
That nebula turns out to be a galaxy.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.000
We thought there was only one galaxy.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.620
Now there's many.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.260
Right.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:39.900
That kind of thing.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.220
Yeah.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.660
Yeah.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.100
Yeah.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:42.780
There's, yeah.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.660
It's, it's definitely a case.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.500
I think science is definitely a good example where, you know, outliers is something you want to find.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.600
Yeah.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.680
It's like biological data.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.120
It's, it's used a lot too.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.600
And well, I guess a lot of areas.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:04.800
The CERN particle accelerator at CERN uses outlier detection a lot just to, to, just to find interesting things.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:05.960
Yeah.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.380
And, you know, to check that, you know, things are within certain bounds of what they expect or not.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:25.780
But yeah, I mean, when you're dealing with certain domains, like one example that's kind of maybe the other end of the spectrum was be when you have, say you're monitoring industrial systems, like an assembly line.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.180
Mm-hmm.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.940
Line or something like this.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.380
That's where you want something, you want the whole system to work in a specific way.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:34.880
Yeah.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:42.200
And any kind of veering from that is, is probably a problem or, or indication of a potent problem down the road.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.120
Right.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.920
You've got some IoT thing or you've got a more industrial type of robot.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:52.040
And all of a sudden it's, it's drilling holes outside of where you used to have it drill holes.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:52.320
Yeah.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:52.700
Yeah.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:52.860
Yeah.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.500
It's, it's behavior is unusual or just.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:05.920
Sensors picking up, tenders or certain, sound levels that are, that are higher than normal or oscillating faster than normal or something.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.180
Yeah.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:06.340
Yeah.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:06.540
Yeah.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:06.540
Yeah.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.040
Yeah.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.040
Yeah.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.040
Yeah.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.040
Yeah.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.540
Yeah.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:07.540
Yeah.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:07.540
Yeah.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:07.540
Yeah.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.540
Yeah.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.040
Yeah.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.540
Yeah.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.740
So, yeah, quite often.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:11.880
Yeah.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.120
I know it could be something interesting or it could be, it could be a problem.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.560
yeah, it really depends on the context, but in, in, in most cases there, there's something

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.460
that's, you know, for one reason or other, there's, it's common for them to be worth

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.960
investigating for, for, you know, to expand your knowledge of, of the system or to just to

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.920
find faired out problems.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.060
Sure.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:37.500
What's the scale of data that outlier detection makes sense for?

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.420
If I've got 20 measurements, does it make sense to ask this question?

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.940
If I've got 200 billion, is that too much to ask the question for?

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.540
Like, what's the story there?

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.960
Yeah, it's good.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.920
it's a good question.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.620
I mean, when you have a very, yes.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.340
I mean, it's like, a lot of areas that could be, I guess the same thing with clustering

00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:01.720
or predictive models or general things of too little data, you can have too much.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.020
And there, there's kind of a sweet spot where the results are statistically stable, but,

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.960
you know, it doesn't take you forever to find them.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.060
Yeah.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.980
They're statistically stable, but they can be computed.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.400
Yes.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:15.640
Yeah.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.360
Yeah.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.740
It's not, you know, a lot of problems, you know, like if you have, say you're checking

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.080
your, you're a large company and you're just checking your, your accounting data for

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:25.920
anomalies.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.720
And it, it, you know, there can be a lot of value to, and you could probably, you know,

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.880
in a lot of cases you can measure written in dollar value.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:40.580
if you find, well, if you find fraud, like you're a high level fraud where your,

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.860
your, your CFO is misrepresenting the company or something, or, or low level fraud where your

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.660
staff are ripping you off or just errors or any inefficiencies or, you know, contractors

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.500
or, or what's up contractors or something.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:52.700
Yeah.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.740
Yeah.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:54.860
Yeah.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.380
They can, yeah.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:01.960
Often when contractors are working, working on, working on you some way, they'll be doing

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.960
kind of a concert with maybe some of your staff.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.340
there's could be some collusion or things like that.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:11.720
So looking at your staff behavior, it'd be worth, it could be, it'd be worth a lot of

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.680
money and the benefit in it.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:18.620
But you know, if it takes you 600 hours to run a process and you find, you know, one thing

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.340
it may or may not be cost effective.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.660
Well, that, that example wouldn't be cost effective.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.180
yeah.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.580
So there's kind of, you know, a balancing act, you, you want to follow.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.100
Yeah.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:36.180
If you, if you have extremely small of points, you save one is anomalous given the others.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:43.740
If you have a bunch of, say you're going through your, your, maybe just looking at,

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.940
just thinking of example of, of staff and areas that are, that company say you have, on

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.180
staff, you have a bunch of, people employed, they're purchasers.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.840
They're just employed to buy supplies from your suppliers.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.940
And, you know, some, maybe you have 10 of them and most of them may.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:06.020
And that work today, you have one that every Friday makes, you know,

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.340
200 purchases a day.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:12.700
so you only have like 10 points there, but, you know, one of them is so off the

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.300
scale that you can say with some confidence that, you know, this is not necessarily a problem,

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.520
but it is anomalous and it is worth understanding.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.060
yeah.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:26.380
you know, either there's some errors or fraud or inefficiency or something, or the other

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.660
people are just, they're the anomaly.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.880
They're, they're not doing their, they're not doing their job.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.420
Yeah.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.100
They're not buying it.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.340
Yeah.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.120
Yeah.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.320
But you're, you're definitely right too.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.180
You can have the other, probably just have so much data.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.640
It's hard to, to go through.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.620
Are there techniques?

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.380
Sorry.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.320
Are there techniques that people use for like use, for example,

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:54.560
Dask or Q, Q, QPy, like the Q, the CUDA stuff for GPUs?

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.320
Are there sort of like really high end compute stuff that people are using for these problems?

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:58.860
Yep.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.320
Yeah.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.440
yeah.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:06.380
And that's, especially if using a deep learning, well, I guess only, but if you're using something

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:11.580
that has a lot of matrix operations, yeah, a GPU will, will speed that up.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:18.720
and, and Dask will, will often, work out, especially have memory limitations as well.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.560
a lot of, LR detection should be done in parallel, which can, can speed things up.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:29.400
LR detection works a little bit like, predictive models in that there's, there's a train step and

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.940
then there's a inference step.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:31.540
Okay.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.360
So those are two different.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.440
You train it what's normal and then you ask it if things seem normal or not.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.820
Yeah, exactly.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.920
So you, you normally what you do when you, with, outlier detection is you have a collection

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.380
of data.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:51.780
So, or if you take the example of an industrial process, so say you monitor your, let's,

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:57.660
let's say in this example, a lot of data, so collecting temperature and sound and, humidity

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.660
and, and, and so on, information.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:05.640
And, say you have a process that's run for weeks without,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.300
any problem.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.300
so during that time, you know that everything was running properly.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.340
So you can take that data and.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:18.760
And, to, to train on, and then that builds up a sense of what's normal.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:24.860
in this case, it's not only statistically normal, but it's also kind of like a, like a platonic

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.100
norm.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.820
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's desirable, as well.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.980
and that's, that's your inference step.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:37.520
And, and, a lot of times they're done once or every few months or something.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.980
and so it's not, terrible.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:47.280
If it takes a little bit of time to train and other contexts in like a real time situation,

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.600
you can have, you know, streaming environments.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.660
We're just constantly reading and dad and it's your sense of what's the new normal.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.420
It's, you know, you might be retraining every few minutes or.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.440
Very few hours in, in which case it becomes a lot more relevant, but it can be, it can

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.660
be done off, offline, but, yeah.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.080
And then, and then just your inference time.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.460
And, and that, that can be, that can be really relevant.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.360
there's certain ways to keep down your, your training time as well as times.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:25.520
If you have, like months of sensor readings, you might not need to, train on

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.040
all of them.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.500
You can just take a sample of them or, you know, a certain time slice or something like

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:29.660
that.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.840
And that's, that's good enough to establish a decent sense of what's normal.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.820
Right.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:40.180
It seems to me that the training could be done on a subset and that would probably

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:40.700
be okay.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:46.440
But I feel like the detection might need to run nearly on everything, right?

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.660
Cause it might be that, that one in a million sort of thing, right?

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.800
Astronomely you're looking for that one little bright spot or that one little dip in brightness

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.320
for a transit of a planet or something.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.620
Or, you know, I've had my credit card.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.700
put on a block until I unblocked it because I bought something in a vending machine for

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.700
a dollar with a credit card.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.440
Yeah.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.520
And they're like, well, a lot of people who steal cards, they'll take them to vending

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.400
machines to try them.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.820
Cause it's a safe place with no one there to see if the stolen card still works and then

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.860
they'll go do bad stuff.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:17.700
Yeah.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:18.040
Yeah.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:18.820
Yeah.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:18.820
Yeah.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.020
Yeah.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.260
yeah.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.900
I mean, I think I would suspect.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:29.320
Well, it could have been cause they do run outlier detection routines.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.140
They could be doing that or they could have been using it like a rule-based system.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.820
Like you're describing where, you know, if it's for very, you know, if it's in a certain

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:41.500
location for a certain dollar value, a certain time of day.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.520
And one might've just faked it because of that.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.120
it was very shady.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.120
I was at the university.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.140
Oh, that's good.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:48.980
But yeah.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.440
Yeah.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.540
It's definitely the case that I'm in most of the time when you're running outlier detection,

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:53.700
yeah.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.720
You want to check all of your data.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.260
Cause otherwise it kind of, you know, the question is, are there any anomalies in my data?

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.700
There are exceptions to that where you just want to check, you just kind of want to spot

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.040
check your data and just want to make sure it's largely free of outliers or that, you

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:13.500
know, there's not, I mean, depending on how you define them, like, for example,

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.440
with sensor readings, like you always expect a certain number of point anomalies, like a

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:24.220
certain point in time where, you know, something spikes up and it's not, it is an anomaly, but

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:24.940
it's not a big deal.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:29.660
so in some, some cases you might just want to make sure that your number of point

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.380
anomalies is normal.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:37.660
So, so you, you don't have an unusual number of unusual events, in, in that case, or,

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:41.080
you know, cases like that, or if you're just doing data quality checks, for example, you

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:46.380
might just want to make sure your data is largely, how do you know that you don't get outliers

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.040
in your training set?

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.160
If you just, just feed it like a stream of data, you're like, well, this is what's normal.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.960
Well, actually there were outliers, but you weren't ready to detect them yet.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.140
And now it's, yeah.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.820
Yeah.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.140
Yeah.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:57.220
Yeah.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.540
most of the time.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.620
When you, when you train, you, you do assume that there's a certain number of outliers,

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.060
uh, in your data.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.500
yeah.

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.060
So you're, we are training on is often, a statistical norm.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.380
It's, it's what's normative.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.860
It's, it's not necessarily what's ideal.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.380
and clean.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.980
It's very hard to get data.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:18.940
That's really clean.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.180
and if you do it often by.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:29.140
this is the data in one way, which kind of undermines outlier detection.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:29.660
Yeah.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.180
It's almost like overtraining maybe.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:36.100
for over when you're doing machine learning.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:48.340
but a similar idea to that in, in that, yeah, it, it learned in that it learns very specific patterns as being, yeah.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:29:00.300
So actually what's fairly common in outlier detection is to, to train and do inference on the same data, with the idea that, you know, you know, there's outliers in there anyway.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:09.860
so, so in some cases, like, well, go back to the example of a, let's say a credit card company.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:16.900
So you have, you want to check, all your transactions for the last day.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:26.420
so you have a hundred gazillion and, you could, you could train on that and then you can also run inference on that.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:30.060
So you can say relative to today's transactions.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.420
Which are the unusual ones, unusual relative to.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:33.700
Right.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.100
I see.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.500
So it's something you wouldn't do in prediction problems, but you actually can.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.660
It's fairly common to do that in outlier detection.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:59.620
And it, yeah, it's just with the idea that, you know, as long as most of the data is, is, is typical, most algorithms will be able to find the records that are the most extreme or the most unusual in one way or another.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.020
relative to the other ones in the data.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.380
Yeah.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:02.980
That's very interesting.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:02.980
Yeah.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:02.980
That's interesting.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:07.860
You can train on the data and then ask it to find the outlier liars in that same data.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.660
Yeah.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.460
It's just kind of interesting.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.820
That seems very, very counterintuitive.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:11.060
Yeah.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.260
It is a little counterintuitive.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:21.860
But like, well, if you met, I guess the simple example I have gave earlier where you have 10, 10 us purchasers for your company.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.180
you would, you could use those 10 to establish a sense of what's normal.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.540
And it would say, well, about four purchases a day is normal.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:35.620
And this one person that has 200 every Friday, that's unusual.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.340
So it's actually doing, you can, you know, do that in the same data.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:38.740
Yeah.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.180
Now, having said that, what you do do in outlier detection.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:51.780
And this, you get a little bit of, you know, start with the original data and find the most anomalous records in there.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:31:00.980
And then you might inspect them manually and say, okay, these are things, yeah, that we wouldn't normally expect to happen.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:08.660
So we can remove those or, or there are things you say they're, they're extreme, but there's nothing wrong with them.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.300
They could happen.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.340
Yeah.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:14.500
Maybe they're a lightning flash when you're looking through a telescope.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.180
It's really bright.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:16.580
Yeah.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.020
Yeah.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:26.260
Well, you get a lot of like, when you're dealing with anything like that, you get a lot of data artifacts where it's, it's not that the phenomena that happened that you're monitoring was unusual.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.260
It's the equipment you use to monitor it.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:32.580
Add some sort of, yeah, power or something like that.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.460
That's a data artifact.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.060
You might want to remove it.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:40.660
So, so sometimes you just, you kind of iteratively make your data cleaner and cleaner and it gets a kind of more pristine sense

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.300
of what's normal.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:41.460
I see.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.060
But you can, you can over fit.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:43.780
Yeah.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:43.940
Yeah.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:43.940
Yeah.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:44.020
Of course.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.500
Go too far.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:44.980
Yeah.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:55.620
Would you maybe find sort of do a, like you say, a loop a couple of times, say, train it and then ask it what's abnormal and figure out, well, these things are truly not part of the things we want to consider.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:01.060
So we'll take them out and then train it again, excluding those and kind of like iterate on it that way.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.980
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:03.300
Yeah.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:08.540
That's, it's not imperative, but that would be a fairly, fairly standard way to do things.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:08.740
Yeah.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.380
Yeah.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:09.860
Okay, cool.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.340
So I, we haven't properly introduced your book yet.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.100
It's outlier detection and Python from me.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.220
And I want to give you a chance to give a shout out about it.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:26.060
And then we're going to, I want to talk to you about a couple of things that you've covered in your book, of course.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:32.900
So I know that we have some discount code for the book that Manning has given us.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.860
I'll put that in the show notes for people interested.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:35.260
Yes.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:35.340
Yes.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:35.740
Well, yeah.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.900
Tell us, tell us about your book of it and why do you write it and what people can learn from it.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.460
Yeah.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:40.700
Yeah.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.020
Okay.

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:48.540
Well, one, one job I worked at a few years ago, I just spent an enormous amount of time.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.580
I was managing a research team.

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.060
And there's about 10 of us on the team.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:33:01.740
And we looked into a lot of areas, but the biggest one for us.

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.300
And so we were doing a lot of work around that.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:10.780
For, well, this is a company, as I mentioned, that was doing financial auditing.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:35.500
So we're building tools that would allow financial auditors to, when performing an audit, examine their clients' data and just, you know, in a fairly easy way, see what's, you know, what's unusual in their data with the idea that, for example, if you're looking through their financial transactions, like if you're an accounting firm and you're auditing

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:53.300
Spatula world, this example I used to always give, for the word L fans, I guess, is they would have a set of sales and a set of purchases and set of payroll transactions and so on.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:34:06.460
So you can go, what auditors would often do is, you know, just find the most anonymous of those, the ones that are among the most important to investigate.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:14.140
To see if there's anything that could suggest an error or something like that.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.880
So we spent a lot of time doing that.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:23.740
We were working with regulators around the world, not just audit firms, but also regulators and bodies like that.

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:31.860
And we spent a lot of time looking at, well, how can we justify the outliers that we're finding?

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:48.240
Because, you know, if we run some of these, most of these algorithms are a little bit like black boxes, blocks, algorithms, like if you're doing a predictive model and you send something through an XGBoost model or a neural net or something, it gives you a prediction.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.500
And it's hard to say why it made that prediction.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.740
So a lot of outlier detection algorithms are like that.

00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:05.660
But it's kind of an issue sometimes because an outlier detection, probably more than with prediction or classification or something or clustering, I should say.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.700
It's important to have an explanation of why something is unusual.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:37.020
If you're flagging something as being actually fraudulent, if you're doing security and you're flagging some web activity as being problematic or a person in some sort of security context is possibly being some sort of security risk.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:44.020
You got to know why in order to investigate effectively.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:54.980
So a lot of time looking at how to make outlier detection one interpretable and also just kind of justify the results that we're finding.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:36:07.620
You know, if we if we if we were if we were building tools that would assess tables of data and come back with a summary of them saying, you know, these are the most unusual records.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:15.340
And it's actually a problem to try to explain why that was the case.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:22.220
So I ended up just reading hundreds of I think like literally hundreds of papers on the subject.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.380
And we did a lot of original research and ended up building up quite a lot of expertise.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:31.860
But also during that time, it just it just it was just a really fascinating, interesting problem.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:45.700
Outlier detection is just a really it just kind of grabs you because, yeah, it's just kind of something fascinating.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:55.740
But you're trying to figure out, you know, if you have a collection of images or collection of sound files or collection, like one job I had, we're working with network data, like social networks.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:04.220
And in that case, you know, connection kind of graph models, you know, what are the most unusual records in there?

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:09.300
Yeah, it's just it's just it's just really challenging.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:14.620
There's no definitive answer, but there's certainly good answers.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:20.300
And there's ways to do it efficiently and interpretably and accurately.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:28.100
But it's difficult, but it's it's it's really rewarding when you kind of get something a hard problem like that working well.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:38.580
Yeah, I imagine it's the kind of thing that if you have those answers, you kind of become real good friends with the CEO or the decision makers.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:45.580
They're like this person, this person can look at it and answer the questions that we can't even know to ask.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.260
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.840
It does open up different ways of thinking about about things.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.340
And yeah. Yeah.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:59.260
It's just yeah, it has a lot of a lot of benefits when you're looking at data.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:09.160
Yeah. Imagine you can probably also make really important decisions for where to put your energy in your your company.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:17.200
Right. Like you had spatula world as an example, like if some product all of a sudden seems like it's it's doing really well and that's an outlier.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.720
Like, should you you should be able to answer.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.000
This is actually gaining a lot of traction.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.120
We should manufacture a bunch or no, that's just some weird glitch.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:35.560
And that's not going to be that's not predictive of should we order 100000 green spatulas or is that just something weird that happened in some restaurant?

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:35.760
Yeah.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.520
All the ones at a store or something.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:37.760
Right.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.420
Yeah.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.860
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.540
It's it's really hard to but important to be able to quantify these things.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:44.900
Exactly.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.340
Yeah. Give some context of.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:46.820
Yeah.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.300
You could end up in a bad place.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:48.740
Yeah.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.600
Make an investment.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.040
Yeah.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.140
Yes.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:55.140
Yes.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:55.140
Yes.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:55.140
Yes.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:55.460
Yes.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:55.460
Yes.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.820
It's the curse of of half understanding.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.700
A little bit.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.760
I've got a great idea.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:00.940
Yeah.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:00.940
Yeah.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.780
All right.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.920
Let's talk about some of the tools that you highlighted in your book.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.920
like the PyOD.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.840
Like the PyOD.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.040
Mm hmm.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:10.040
Mm hmm.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.040
Python outlier detection.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.040
Yeah.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:13.280
Yeah.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.160
Let's talk about this one.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.500
What was the story of this thing?

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.880
It is used quite a bit used by 4000 people and 8.8000 GitHub stars.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.520
That's pretty, pretty well used.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.520
It is.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:24.800
Yeah.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.920
It's really the, it's the go to one for outlier detection in Python.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:34.320
I think, I think anyone's doing any kind of machine learning work in, in Python.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.780
I mean, the one tool there they'll know is scikit-learn.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.340
And scikit-learn comes with four outlier.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.940
Well, it comes with four outlier detectors.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.780
And also.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:52.240
So some tools that natively is outlier detection, like has a KDE tool, kernel density estimation.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.660
Which makes it fairly easy to find outliers.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.300
It's just points in space that have low density.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:03.340
As a clustering method called Gaussian mixture models, GNM.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:09.960
Which makes it outlier detection using that as well.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.100
But PyOD, yeah.

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.280
So PyOD has those.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.000
Has basically everything in scikit-learn.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.320
Wraps it in its own interface.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.420
And I think a couple dozen more.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.380
And it also has a number of deep learning based ones.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.280
So for tabular data, it's.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:29.720
It's really to go first, probably.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.740
So, yeah.

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.200
In terms of deep learning as well.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.560
Auto encoders, variational auto encoders, GANs.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.700
There are some limitations with PyOD.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.680
And I do get into that in the book.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:44.520
And soon.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.600
For example.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.640
Which, you know.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.000
If you're dealing with tabular data.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.680
Realistically, you have mixed data.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.160
You know.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.260
A lot of categorical columns.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:52.980
Date columns.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.360
So PyOD does not handle that.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.080
And it's strictly for tabular data.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.780
So if you're working with time series data.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.480
Or image data.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.220
Audio data.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:03.920
That sort of thing.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.660
There are other tools involved for that.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:06.820
But, yeah.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:07.580
For tabular data.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:07.940
It's.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:08.340
It's.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.660
It's.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:09.980
It's.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.260
Pretty.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.800
It's pretty much the most used one.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.160
Okay.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.120
Yeah.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:17.480
So.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.280
Let's see here.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.300
Got the NLP 80 bench.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.000
For.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.400
NLP anomaly detection.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.620
So I'm guessing this is.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.560
In text.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.620
I'm not sure.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.540
You have to tell us.

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:31.020
What kind of stuff you detect with that.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:31.400
But, you know.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:31.720
I want to.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.980
Give it some articles.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.680
Or maybe give it social media posts.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.220
Or.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.440
Something along those lines.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.140
And then ask it.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.140
What kind of questions.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.120
Could you ask it about that?

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:45.320
I mean.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.700
NLP is kind of.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.720
It's a dicey area.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.880
Without layer detection.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.880
And actually.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.940
Dicey is too strong a word.

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.140
It's a harder area.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.600
It's certainly a harder area.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.180
To work with.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:55.660
Because.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.460
Like.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.020
If.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:58.680
Like.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.000
If you have.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.540
Tables of data.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:00.980
Again.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:01.740
Like.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:02.100
Let's say.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:02.900
Accounting data.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.720
For example.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.680
If a bunch of transactions.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.160
It's.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.480
It's difficult to say.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.660
Which are the most unusual.

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.020
Transactions.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:10.920
In your.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.540
Data.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.700
It's kind of.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.340
Like.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:14.980
You know.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:15.620
When you see it.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.100
Like.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:16.640
If you see something.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.540
That's very unusual.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.200
You can say.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:18.440
Okay.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:18.700
That.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.880
That transaction is unusual.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.700
With text.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.040
It's.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.760
That is harder.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.460
To say.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:22.720
Like.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.320
I mean.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:23.600
If it's.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:23.800
Yeah.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.860
Completely different language.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:25.860
Or something like that.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:26.680
Or the tone.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.000
Or.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:27.700
You know.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.280
Writing style.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:28.980
Is completely.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.740
Different.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.840
Yeah.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.220
Anomaly.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:34.720
It could have.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:34.740
It could have.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.720
It could have curse words.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.760
And people might think.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.260
It's angry.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:37.920
But in fact.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.840
It's just.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.600
Sort of a coarse way.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.880
Of expressing excitement.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.660
Right.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.100
Like.

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:43.600
Oh.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.520
These people are really angry.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:44.720
Like.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:44.880
No.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.960
They're actually really happy.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.320
But they don't really express it.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:47.600
Right.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:47.800
Right.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.380
But if the rest of the corpus.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.000
Did not have any expletives.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:51.620
Then.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:52.540
Yeah.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:52.780
In a sense.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:52.800
Yeah.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.100
That's.

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.320
That's anomalous.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.320
In that way.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.340
Yeah.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.820
Yeah.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.180
Yeah.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.500
Which is so many ways.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.680
It's just a little bit different.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.240
Yeah.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:04.620
It's.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.580
I would consider it one of the more challenging areas of.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:09.160
Yeah.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:09.940
I would as well.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.120
Of outlier detection.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:11.420
Yeah.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:12.780
Yeah.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.660
Maybe talk about LLMs as well.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:15.440
Straightforward as well.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.700
Yeah.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.860
I'm sure.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.100
We'll talk about LLMs as well.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.160
And see how that changes things.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:20.580
Or not.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.400
In a little bit.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.860
But the other one you mentioned is scikit-learn.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:24.720
Like this is.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.180
Kind of the granddaddy of.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.740
A lot of the data science type of stuff.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.460
And they've got a whole section on novelty.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:33.440
And outlier detection.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.360
Yeah.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:34.720
Maybe.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.500
I'm going to hit it up on the screen for a little bit.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.020
But give people a sense of.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:40.000
The kind of problems you can ask with this one.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.800
Well.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.040
Yeah.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:41.740
How did you solve?

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:42.420
Questions you can ask.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:42.600
Yeah.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.080
Yeah.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:43.540
It's a little bit.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:44.520
It's a little bit like Pi.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.800
It's less so.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.520
But.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.560
And you know.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.220
It doesn't have.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:53.500
Like 30 sectors.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:53.920
It has.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.320
You know.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:54.540
Four.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.560
But it includes two of them.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.440
So again.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.540
It's just for tabular data.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:58.940
And again.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.160
It's just numeric tabular data.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.220
But it has two of the.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.600
The go-to algorithms.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.080
They're called.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.460
One's called isolation forest.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.420
And the other is called local outlier factor.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.260
And.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.340
I think most of the time.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.240
With outlier detection.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:15.860
If you're doing.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.140
You know.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.780
On tabular data.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.560
If you're only going to use two algorithms.

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:19.820
Those are the two.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.640
Outlier detection.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.360
Is a little bit different.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.100
Than say prediction.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:23.900
Because you know.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.200
If you're building a predictive model.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.780
Say on tabular data.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:29.680
You know.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.280
Most of the time.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:30.900
You would use.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.160
Say.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.360
An XG boost model.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.560
Or a cat boost model.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.220
Or a random forest.

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:36.920
Or something like that.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.980
You would tend to use one.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.040
Model.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.620
Sometimes it has to be.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.560
So accuracy you can.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.160
You would.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.120
You'd create an ensemble.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.460
I mean.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.140
Actually boost.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:49.600
Internally is an ensemble.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.040
Of it's a boosted ensemble.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:51.840
Of decision trees.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:52.060
But.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.920
You know.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.860
Normally you wouldn't.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.840
Sometimes you do.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.240
I wouldn't say.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.500
But probably more often.

00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.500
We don't create.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:44:59.980
You know.

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:00.940
An ensemble.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:01.700
Of a KNN.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.720
And an SVM.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.240
And a neural net.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.100
And a random forest.

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.260
In outlier detection.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.300
That's a lot more common.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.020
To do that.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.500
And the reason is that.

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.160
Each outlier detection algorithm.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.720
It can be a little bit limited.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.180
In one way or another.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:19.600
They're.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:23.320
Not.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:23.720
Not.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.400
Not in an extreme way.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.800
But they each look for.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.400
Different types of outliers.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.840
And they each look for outliers.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.020
In different ways.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.180
And it's just.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:34.360
Is a lot more.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.860
Advantage to using multiple.

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.260
Detection algorithms.

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:40.020
With outlier detection.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:40.620
Than you would with.

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:41.200
Prediction.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.000
And you can do it.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.340
In just a really simple way.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.040
If you say.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:44.540
You know.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.140
Psychic learn.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.540
Has four outlier detectors.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:48.280
It has.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.740
Isolation forest.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.160
It has.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.240
Local outlier fact.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:55.420
Has one called.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:56.760
And has one called.

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.580
Elliptic envelope.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.740
So if I run the four of those.

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.380
On my data.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:01.420
And let's say.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:02.220
They're all four of them.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:02.960
Are appropriate.

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.140
And work well.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.140
Any records that are scored highly.

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.640
By all four of those detectors.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.320
You can say.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:09.800
Well these.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.080
These records are really.

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.580
That's interesting.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:12.960
Yeah.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.060
That's interesting to see.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:14.600
Weird.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.740
Yeah.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:16.160
Yeah.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:16.880
You can let it say.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.940
We've checked many different ways.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.100
And we've got the same answer.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.020
That it's an outlier.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:21.700
Yeah.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.700
In these different.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:22.940
Yeah.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.220
So you have.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.320
And so it's really likely.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.240
Yeah.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.220
It's really likely.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.500
It's not necessarily a problem.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.380
But it is statistically.

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.380
Unusual.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:31.140
And.

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:31.520
Yeah.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:31.720
And.

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:34.600
I think.

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:34.600
I think.

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:34.920
You know.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.200
If you're just a lot of intense.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.020
Outlier detection.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:38.260
Work to do.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.120
You just have a.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:39.700
You know.

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.540
Small data set.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.280
And you just want to quickly.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.400
Get a sense of.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:42.940
What.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:43.320
You know.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.800
What are the most anomalous records in it.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.760
Just using scikit-learn.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.960
With the assumption that you.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:48.320
You know.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.240
You're using scikit-learn.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.500
Anyways.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:53.020
For a lot of you.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:53.920
Using that is the.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.120
Yeah.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.300
Sufficient for a lot of cases.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.120
If you.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.020
Want to.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.140
Do a little bit more thorough job.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.020
Using more.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:02.860
Detectors.

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:03.340
Again.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.140
And just using.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.300
Detectors that.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.320
Can be a little bit more.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:13.060
Pyod has one.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:13.340
More.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.320
As interpretable.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.380
It could be a good.

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.720
Good decision.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.900
Just to use pyod.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.040
And use a bunch of.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.560
The detectors there.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.440
One of the nice things.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.720
About pyod is it has the same.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.680
API signature.

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.640
For all of its detectors.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.300
So if you write code.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:28.920
And it only.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.960
Usually only like four.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.660
Really kind of.

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:34.200
Easy.

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.780
Other than.

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.500
The hyper parameters for them.

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.700
It's really quite easy.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:41.680
Just kind of swap one out.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.800
And swap in another.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:43.500
And just.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.540
You know.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.060
Try a whole.

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:46.780
Whole bunch of them.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.020
So one thing.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.220
I do get into the book.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:49.680
Is that.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.000
Yeah.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.420
A lot of.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:54.420
A lot of.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.880
That can be.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.740
Very useful to use.

00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:00.380
The ones in pyod.

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.020
They're.

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:01.320
They're.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:01.920
They're good.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.000
And.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.380
They're sufficient quite often.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:04.900
But they're.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.360
They're.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:05.680
They're.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.520
They're limited into how interpretable.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.020
They are.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:08.840
So again.

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.660
If you're in a situation.

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:10.180
Where you're saying.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:14.780
Security.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:15.620
Or this looks like.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:16.380
Failing equipment.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:17.220
Or this looks like.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.400
A novel.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.160
Specimen.

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.540
What.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.100
Say.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:23.940
Say from astronomy.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:24.360
This looks like.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:24.800
A novel.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.780
Transit.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.100
This is a transit.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:27.760
That's not normal.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:29.920
You kind of.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.560
You want to know why.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.000
And.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.840
Yeah.

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:35.980
So a lot of the detectors.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:36.640
From pyod.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.040
Don't.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:37.860
Don't provide that.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.840
Necessarily.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.540
To the degree.

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.300
You would wish.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:42.120
So.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:42.840
I.

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:43.680
You know.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.800
Do suggest a bunch of others.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.840
That could be useful.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.400
For that purpose.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.200
And that support.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:47.820
Categorical.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.540
Data.

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:49.340
As well.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.200
But yeah.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:51.960
Second learning is probably.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.320
Numeric stuff.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:52.940
Like male.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:53.300
Female.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.060
Or.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.220
Exactly.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:55.860
Low income.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:56.540
Or whatever.

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:57.220
Yeah.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:57.940
Exactly.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.560
Okay.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.920
Cool.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.060
And another one.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:06.220
We talked about time series.

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:06.580
A little bit.

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.360
You said the time series.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.400
Are pretty challenging.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:08.800
And.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.860
I guess it depends on how much.

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.120
How rapidly.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.160
The time series data.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:13.720
Is coming in.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.220
Yeah.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.540
That's actually one of the things.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.400
About time series data.

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:16.700
Is that.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:17.020
It can.

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.080
It can be.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.420
Streaming.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.900
And coming in.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:23.020
And.

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:23.480
Yeah.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.340
So just like I was saying.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:24.560
Like.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.200
Very often.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:25.700
We use.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:26.600
And.

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.400
Ensembles.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.320
Of outlier detectors.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.100
To try and.

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.600
Analyze the data.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.320
And.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.520
By their nature.

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:33.980
Ensembles.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:34.860
Can be a little bit slower.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:35.760
Now you can run them in parallel.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.420
Yeah.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:37.660
Right.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.320
Because it's basically.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.560
You take three or four.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.440
Or a thousand.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.640
Decision trees.

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.560
And you ask them all.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.360
What their answers are.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.080
And then you kind of.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:44.260
Like.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.340
Decide what the.

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.540
It's like a voting process.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.240
Or something almost.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:47.460
Right.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.240
Yeah.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:48.720
Yeah.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.180
Yeah.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:49.280
Yeah.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:49.500
So.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.000
Yeah.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.920
And that would be.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.760
Exactly.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.740
How you would do it.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:53.740
In a predictive model.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:54.040
So.

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:54.480
With.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.800
An outlier detection model.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.220
Well.

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:57.500
There's.

00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.960
Probably the closest thing.

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.340
To what you just described.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.840
With outlier detection.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.400
Action is.

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.300
There's an.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.220
Isolation forest.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.560
Which is a forest.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.600
Of isolation trees.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.300
So it's kind of.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.340
Similar ideas.

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.860
It's probably close to.

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:13.700
A little bit close to.

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:14.320
Random forest.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.200
It's probably a little closer.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.080
To extra trees.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.260
For anyone who's.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.240
Familiar with.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.740
Predictive models.

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.500
Yeah.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.460
That's an isolation forest.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.300
So it's kind of.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:24.440
The outlier detection.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.540
Equivalent of.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.420
Extra trees model.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.280
Okay.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.000
And.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:28.920
Like that.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.660
Is that.

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:30.080
It's.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:30.300
You know.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.560
Composed of a whole bunch of.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.440
Trees.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.300
And depending on the.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.280
Implementation of it.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:34.800
Not.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.640
Psychic learns.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:35.860
But.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:36.560
Depending on the.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.300
Implementation of it.

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.360
You can run all those.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.700
Trees.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:42.900
And you know.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:43.640
Your answer is quite.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.400
Fast.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.620
If you have.

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:46.460
Sufficient hardware.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.840
What can also be done.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.700
Without layer detection.

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:50.400
Too is.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.320
Which can actually.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.200
Depending on your.

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.420
Your environment.

00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:56.600
Working a little faster.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.580
Can actually be faster.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:58.340
To run your.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.580
Detectors in sequence.

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:01.380
Believe it or not.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.260
Because what you can do then is.

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.740
Is.

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.480
Tell you how you find your outliers.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:08.700
But.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:09.440
Say you say.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.860
I only want.

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:11.960
I'm only concerned with things.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.500
That are flagged by the isolation forest.

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.180
And.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:14.900
The.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.620
Local outlier factor.

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.460
Model.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.220
And the.

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.020
K&N model.

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:19.900
And the.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:21.800
Auto encoder model.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.800
You can run them in.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.300
So anything that's filtered out.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.000
By the first model.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.020
Doesn't need to be sent.

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:26.880
To the second model.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:27.300
Right.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.160
Or the third model.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:28.820
Or the fourth model.

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:29.420
So you can run.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.140
You can kind of put the fastest one out first.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:31.660
And then the.

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.760
Second.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:33.340
Yeah.

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:33.840
That's interesting.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.340
Almost like thinking about it.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:36.560
Like an if statement.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.120
Or a while loop.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:38.440
Or something.

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.020
In programming.

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.540
Where the ands.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:41.240
Short circuit.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:41.860
So.

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:42.240
You know.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:42.540
Like.

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:44.820
You want to do the simplest test.

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.340
First.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:46.140
And then the next one.

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:46.760
The next one.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.180
And you're only going to evaluate it.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:48.880
Until you hit a false.

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.760
And then you stop.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.380
Yes.

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:50.920
Exactly.

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:51.300
Yeah.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:51.720
Yeah.

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:52.280
Yeah.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:52.380
Yeah.

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:52.600
That's.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:52.820
Yeah.

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:53.660
That's a good way to put it.

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:54.400
Yeah.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:54.660
Yeah.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:54.760
Yeah.

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.820
Okay.

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:57.260
Yeah.

00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:57.980
If you do it in sequence.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:58.320
That's.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.300
That'll definitely speed it up.

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.040
Rather than taking all the data.

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:02.740
Run it in parallel.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.260
Across all the cores.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:04.620
You're like.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:05.680
Well look how awesome it is.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.740
It's using all the cores.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:07.080
But if.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:07.400
Yes.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:07.780
That's right.

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.020
You're like.

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:09.180
No.

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.220
We just run less of it.

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.420
So we don't have to do it so much.

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.060
Yeah.

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:12.540
Yeah.

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.040
I mean that.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.600
There would still be benefit to that.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.260
Notically how anomalous things are.

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.020
Which you might.

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:20.520
Like.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.480
I mean if.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.600
If you're not looking for.

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.160
To flag the individual anomalies.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:24.540
You're trying.

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.640
You're more interested in collecting statistics about.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.180
The volume of anomalies.

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:28.600
Like you're.

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:29.360
It's more.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.440
A data monitoring project.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.380
Or something like that.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:32.880
As opposed to.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.100
Picking out the.

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:38.240
Individual anomalies.

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:38.620
You might.

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:40.500
But if you just want to pick out the.

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.880
The really anomalous records.

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:43.860
Then yes.

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.220
They might be the ones that are flagged by.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.340
All of your detect.

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:47.380
Or almost all of your detect.

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:47.580
Right.

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.440
Well you don't even have to do.

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.580
You could even do it partially.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:49.860
Like.

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:50.540
If.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.340
If it's not flagged by three.

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:53.320
Out of five.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.240
Then we're not going to pass it further down the line.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:55.500
Yeah.

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:55.980
Like you could.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.640
You could still do some sort of intermediate.

00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.080
More squishy.

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.500
Analysis like that.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:00.700
But.

00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:00.960
Yeah.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.120
You could still short circuit.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:02.400
Yeah.

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.320
Kind of a sweet spot.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:03.540
Yeah.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.200
Yeah.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:04.720
Yeah.

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.220
That would be.

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.040
That would be a good balance.

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:06.420
I think.

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:06.640
Yeah.

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:06.900
Yeah.

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.140
Okay.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:07.720
I mean it's all.

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.100
It's.

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.240
It's like anything.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.380
There's going to be false positives.

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.160
And false negatives.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:11.520
But.

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.300
You would get a good balance of that.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:14.340
Yeah.

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:14.580
Nice.

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.620
So.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.480
The.

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.120
One of the other projects that you called out is profit.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.020
Time series anomaly detection.

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.180
With profit.

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.360
And it's based on.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.300
The.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:25.940
Facebook's open source.

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:26.620
Library.

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:27.720
Profit.

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.280
This is profit anomaly detection versus just.

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.820
Straight profit.

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:33.860
Which is.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:34.940
A tool for.

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.560
Producing high quality forecast for time series.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.460
Data that has multiple.

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:39.760
Seasonality.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.660
With.

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:41.780
Linear and non-linear growth.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.820
I imagine that.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:43.360
Facebook.

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.940
Probably has a lot of data.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.940
In its time series.

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:48.680
Yep.

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.100
If anyone does.

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:50.840
Yes.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.800
They would have phenomenal amounts.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.980
And there's probably all sorts of things.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:53.420
They want to.

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:54.460
They want to forecast.

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.580
And.

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:56.820
Yeah.

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:57.240
This is.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:57.380
So.

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:58.040
Tell people about this.

00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:58.700
This project.

00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.460
And how they might use it.

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:00.820
Yeah.

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:01.080
Well.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:01.280
I mean.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:01.480
There's.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.880
There's a number of ways to do.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:03.600
Outlier detection.

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.300
With time series data.

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.460
And it's.

00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.480
It's a little bit like.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:08.920
I was saying.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:09.660
With tabular data.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:10.240
You can look at.

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.620
Your data.

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:12.720
In all kinds of different ways.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.680
And they might all be.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.400
Legitimately.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:14.900
Just find.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.160
Different types of outliers.

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.100
A really.

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.280
Really simple.

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.460
Case.

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:20.780
Which.

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.280
Can be useful.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.020
Despite its simplicity.

00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:24.900
Is if.

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:26.100
You just have.

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:27.260
Just a timeline.

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:27.700
Over.

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.280
Over time.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.040
Of points.

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.480
So.

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.040
Say you have.

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.440
Well.

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:33.960
Say your.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.220
Social media.

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.440
Be.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.220
Be enough.

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:37.460
That.

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:42.440
As.

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.760
You might want to.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.400
Look at.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:44.620
You know.

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.420
I don't know.

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.520
Your server usage.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:46.820
Or.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:47.980
Ad revenues.

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:48.420
And there's.

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:48.680
There's all.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.600
Just all kinds of things.

00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:49.960
That you're.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:50.520
You're predicting.

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.700
Right.

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:52.000
Maybe.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:52.860
One thing.

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.140
That things will be going viral.

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:54.660
And so maybe.

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:55.480
We should boost that.

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.000
In the algorithm.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.020
And show it to more people.

00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:57.700
Yeah.

00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:58.020
Which.

00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.280
Can be very good.

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.440
Or.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:01.260
Not so good.

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:01.720
But anyway.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:02.700
It still works.

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.320
With the incentives.

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:03.820
And the.

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:04.480
The goals of.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:04.640
Hey.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.340
We want more engagement.

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:05.860
On the platform.

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:06.160
Right.

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:06.840
Yeah.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.320
Yeah.

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.020
So.

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:12.780
I mean.

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:13.100
I guess.

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:13.760
One of the simple.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.180
Example.

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.020
Maybe weather data.

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:15.340
Or.

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:17.080
Going outside.

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:17.580
Of a social.

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:18.460
Media company.

00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:19.740
Where you just.

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:20.020
Track.

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:20.320
You know.

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.560
Temperature over time.

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.180
And there's.

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.180
Certain seasonality.

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.880
To that.

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.060
What is that plot there?

00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:27.640
That is.

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.060
Hard to say.

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:29.500
What that is.

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.620
Their example.

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:30.880
Is.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:31.100
Let's see.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:31.400
If they.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.040
They call it out.

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.320
Oh.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:33.800
That could be.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.320
Weather data.

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.240
Or it could be.

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:35.680
It's not.

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.560
They don't really say.

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.580
Have they named their.

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:38.420
All their data.

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:38.960
Is named.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:39.520
DF.

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.980
They do.

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:44.980
They profit.

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:45.240
Work.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.160
They only have two columns.

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:47.860
There's the time.

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:48.380
Column.

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.220
And there's the.

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:49.960
Value column.

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.480
And then.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.900
The legend says.

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:54.460
Anomaly.

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:54.920
Actual.

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:55.420
Predicted.

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:55.720
Base.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.040
There's.

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:56.760
There's no.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.500
Information here.

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:58.000
That tells you.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:58.700
What data this is.

00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:59.700
But it still gives you.

00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:00.640
It's still a cool picture.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:01.520
To show you how it works.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:01.780
Yeah.

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.180
Here's the prior.

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:04.240
Block of.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:04.840
Of data.

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:05.660
Like last week.

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.060
Or something.

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:06.640
And now.

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:07.760
Here's the next week.

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.820
And.

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:09.820
Are we going to predict.

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:10.480
If this is.

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.300
An anomaly.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:11.800
Or not.

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:12.060
Right.

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:12.700
Yeah.

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:13.160
Yeah.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.440
That is kind of the nature.

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.160
Of time series.

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:15.640
Data is.

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.040
It doesn't really matter.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.160
If it's weather data.

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:18.940
Or stock data.

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:19.320
Or.

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.100
You know.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:21.000
Bird migration data.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:21.340
It's.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:21.720
It's.

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.600
As long as there's certain.

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.920
Patterns to it.

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.040
That can be found.

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.120
You can work with it.

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:27.840
Kind of equivalently.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:28.360
So.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:28.600
Yeah.

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:28.880
What.

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:29.560
What they're.

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.620
What.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:33.340
I think they're showing.

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:33.800
Are it looks.

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.760
Something you often do in time series data.

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.680
Is you have a certain.

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.360
Pattern that's existed in time.

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.020
So there's a certain.

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.920
Downward trend in that.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.480
And there's some.

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.400
Seasonality.

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.640
And so maybe.

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.940
This might be days of the week.

00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:46.680
Or.

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.860
Yeah.

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:48.920
Those look like days of the week.

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.520
So.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:49.780
Like.

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.660
Maybe things are busier on a weekend.

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:52.020
Or.

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:53.140
Or something like that.

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.300
And that.

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.060
Okay.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:55.660
So.

00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:57.420
Given the patterns that have.

00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.460
Occurred in the past.

00:56:58.460 --> 00:56:59.080
Where you know.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.280
Look at the time of the day.

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:00.600
And.

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:01.960
The day of the week.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.140
The.

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.280
Month.

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:03.640
The year.

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.340
And the like.

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.280
You can make.

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.780
Projections into the future.

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:09.140
Forecasts.

00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:10.100
And.

00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.460
Then you look at your actual data.

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:12.600
And if.

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.040
Your.

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.300
If your forecast is generally correct.

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.680
But you have some.

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.860
Points that are.

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:19.520
Way off from your projection.

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.740
You.

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:21.220
Those.

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:21.500
Those.

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.460
That's a form of anomaly.

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:22.580
Okay.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:22.580
Okay.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:22.580
So.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:26.460
So that's something that's often.

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:27.500
To actually just saying.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:28.360
You know.

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.160
We.

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:29.860
Given the.

00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.720
The history of.

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.500
Of what we've seen.

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.900
We would have really expected a value of.

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:34.620
You know.

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:35.160
10 here.

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.020
But we see a value of.

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:36.680
38.

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.660
So.

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:39.400
There's something unusual there.

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.820
It just doesn't follow the normal.

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.240
Seasonality.

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.040
And normal.

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.400
Trends that we've seen.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.420
Yeah.

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:46.360
It probably can't necessarily.

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:48.320
Give you too much insight.

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:48.960
As to why.

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:49.240
But.

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.440
You should go look at it.

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:50.620
Right.

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:51.220
Because it's just.

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:51.860
Yeah.

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:52.780
The quantity.

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:53.800
And time.

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:54.280
Right.

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:54.940
It's pretty.

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.840
Sparse data.

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.320
Yeah.

00:57:59.320 --> 00:57:59.760
Yeah.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.140
I mean.

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:01.540
You might be able to see why.

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.080
You made the prediction you did.

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.480
Because it's just based on.

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.020
Depending on how you.

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:07.140
There's a lot of ways to do.

00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:08.160
Profit works a certain way.

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:08.400
And there's.

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.260
There's a lot of ways to do.

00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:10.140
Time series forecasting.

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:10.860
But generally.

00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:11.720
You're just looking at.

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.040
The.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.180
The regular patterns.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:14.480
The.

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.440
The general trend.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:15.700
And.

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.100
Maybe just like.

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:17.860
Leg features.

00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:19.220
And things like that.

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:19.560
So.

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.340
You can figure out.

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:21.460
Why you made the prediction you did.

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:21.800
But yeah.

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.600
Why it actually had.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.040
The actual value that it did.

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.000
Yeah.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:25.900
You'll probably have to go.

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:26.740
And investigate.

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.620
Sure.

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.540
Maybe pull up some.

00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:29.560
Some different tools.

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.300
And different algorithms.

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.080
Now that you know.

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.160
And focus in on that.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.760
All right.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.120
But let's talk about one more thing.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.400
While we're.

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.760
While we're here.

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.980
What's the story with.

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:41.820
MLMs.

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:42.980
And outlier detection.

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:44.160
And I think there's two angles.

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:44.940
I'd like to.

00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:46.140
Talk about this with you.

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:46.620
Pretty.

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:47.380
Pretty quickly.

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:47.940
Just briefly.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:49.540
One.

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:50.920
Can I just throw.

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:51.940
A ton of data.

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:53.560
At ChatGPT.

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:54.320
And I'm not talking.

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:54.680
The.

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.260
The ChatGPT for model.

00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:56.560
I'm.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.320
I'm talking like.

00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:58.080
Oh one.

00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.200
Reason.

00:58:59.200 --> 00:58:59.420
You know.

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:00.320
The higher end model.

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:00.860
That can take.

00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:02.020
Could hold all the data.

00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:02.540
Potentially.

00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.840
And it's a little bit more thorough.

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.860
And ask it.

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:05.640
Find me the outliers.

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:06.860
Like is that a world.

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:07.540
A thing that.

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:08.620
You might.

00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:09.400
Might work.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.220
And the other is.

00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.580
Could I give it some data.

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:12.060
And say.

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:13.160
Describe the data.

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:13.560
And say.

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.000
Okay.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.860
Here's the situation.

00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:17.040
Here's what this data means.

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.680
Recommend me.

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.440
Algorithms.

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:19.940
And tools.

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:20.560
And libraries.

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:21.560
And even techniques.

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.140
To analyze it.

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:24.700
Like.

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.240
Does chat make sense.

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:26.840
For either of these?

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.920
It can.

00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.800
I mean.

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:30.340
It's going to be like.

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:30.820
A lot of things.

00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:31.320
If you have.

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:33.060
If you have an expertise.

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:33.600
In these.

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.000
Sort of areas.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.860
You're going to be better off.

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:36.940
Just to take advantage.

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:37.360
Of that.

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:37.580
But.

00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.480
Like a lot of areas.

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:41.060
Data science.

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:41.780
If you're working.

00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:42.780
Into an area.

00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:43.140
That you're.

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:44.620
You don't happen.

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:45.360
To have spent years.

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:45.920
Thinking about.

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:48.220
These.

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:48.500
Yeah.

00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:49.000
These tools.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:49.920
Can be a good place.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.580
To get you started.

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.180
I've worked with them a bit.

00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.060
And what I've found.

00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:54.440
Is.

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:54.980
Though.

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:55.660
I have to admit.

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:56.320
I haven't used.

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.080
O1 yet.

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.300
I used tools.

00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:59.200
That were a little bit older.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.900
And.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.420
What I was finding.

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:03.660
Is.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:04.060
It was.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:04.940
Suggesting.

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:05.560
Outliers.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.000
But.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.800
In.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.040
A really.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:10.600
Perfect.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.680
A limited way.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.000
So.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:12.940
It would suggest.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:13.960
Doing like a Z score.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.080
Or Z score.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:15.880
Test.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.520
On your.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.400
On your numeric columns.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.220
Or checking into quartile ranges.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.000
And things like that.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:21.780
Which are.

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.220
Good ways to find outliers.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.660
And.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:26.860
I think it may be suggested.

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:27.140
You know.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:28.300
Using an isolation forest.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:28.940
And a couple.

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:32.620
Thanks.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.520
I think.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:33.540
I think.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:33.780
Over.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.860
Reasonably well.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.060
It.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:37.380
I.

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:37.960
I kept.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.500
Trying to do a lot of.

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.200
Prompt engineering.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.120
To try and get it to.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.680
Push it towards more sophisticated analysis.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.340
Of the data.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:45.520
And.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.040
That wasn't happening.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.300
Though.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.320
You know.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:49.780
Who knows.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:50.060
Maybe.

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.360
If not.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:51.640
These.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.200
This version.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:55.400
Maybe.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.760
I think.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.120
We're heading.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:57.800
To that point.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.240
Where it can.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.100
It can start to do that.

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.060
And again.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:00.260
Yeah.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:00.880
Same with trying.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.220
To summarize the data.

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.180
And find the patterns.

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:03.540
In there.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.200
You know.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:05.940
It's able to do.

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.340
Fairly well.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.420
Yeah.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.480
It's not.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.060
The level of.

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:11.260
Like.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:11.620
You know.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:12.120
What a real.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.620
Certainly not.

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:14.040
The level of.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:14.320
Someone with.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.080
Domain expertise.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.080
That really understands.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:16.640
The data.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.620
Is going to be.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:18.160
Able to do.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.240
But.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.200
It can provide.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:21.580
Some rough.

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.520
Summarization.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.060
Of the data.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:23.560
And.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.840
Maybe point you.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.520
In the right direction.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.300
Yeah.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.060
Some tools.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:28.500
You don't know.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:28.740
Maybe.

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.180
And you could go.

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:29.700
Use them.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:30.440
Yeah.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:30.920
I mean.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.300
But.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:32.380
So I'm not.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.180
I'm kind of.

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:34.940
Like leaning towards.

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:35.520
Saying it's.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.000
It's not going to be.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:37.760
Doing the best.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.900
But having said that.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.720
They work a lot better.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.280
When I have tested them.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:43.920
For outlier detection.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.260
Than.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.480
You know.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.000
A year ago.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.360
Or something.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:49.680
So.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.680
It's.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.380
It's heading in the direction.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.840
Where they might be able to do something quite useful.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.180
Yeah.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:53.960
Yeah.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.500
I've started using the O1 model.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.580
And.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.440
It's.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.320
It's a lot slower.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.100
But you just got to change your mindset.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.440
It's not a chat conversation.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:01.860
It's a.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:02.100
No.

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:02.620
I've.

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:03.420
I've given this.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.260
It's like I've given an intern a job.

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:06.940
And I expect it to come back with me.

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:07.460
Later.

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.440
And it's.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.760
It's getting better and better.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.080
It's.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.100
It's a crazy time.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:11.840
Yeah.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.220
Oh.

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:12.560
It's.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.120
It's.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.400
It's.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.460
Too remarkable.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.120
Yeah.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:19.720
It really is.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.360
It really is.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.340
Yeah.

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:21.720
All right.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.000
Awesome.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:22.500
Well.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.280
Mixed feelings.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:23.520
But I.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.240
Yeah.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:24.560
I know.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.320
I know.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.720
Let's close this whole thing out with.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.260
Maybe.

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:30.700
Just a.

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.780
A final call to action.

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:32.400
People are.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.560
Are interested in this topic.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.500
They want to do more.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.200
Maybe.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.840
Another shout out to your book.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.420
If you want.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.200
And.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:38.480
Yeah.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:38.940
Just people.

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.120
People are interested.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:40.820
They want to do more.

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.960
Go deeper.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.600
What do you tell them?

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.040
Oh.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:45.500
Definitely.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.820
I would recommend the book.

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.140
Of course.

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.080
I really.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:49.960
It's on Manning.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.740
I really wanted to write.

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.100
When I was looking to write.

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:54.960
With Manning.

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.440
It's just a publishing company.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:56.700
I.

01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:57.840
Always.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.720
Thought.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.380
Highly.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.060
Scope.

01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:03.680
Manning.com.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.180
And look for outlier detection.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:06.480
And I think.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:06.740
Well.

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.760
If you have.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.140
The affiliate link.

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.720
That'll give you 45% off too.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.160
Which is.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.860
Which is a nice link.

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:14.680
I think.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.100
I mean.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.640
Yeah.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.680
You know.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.420
The book has gotten.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.400
Quite good feedback.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:19.620
I.

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:23.420
One thing.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:23.740
I really.

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:24.000
Is.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.140
People.

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:25.980
Are architects.

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.540
Of the.

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:26.920
You know.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.740
The most important.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:28.560
Algorithms.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.600
In outlier detection.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.380
So things like.

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:31.720
Isolation forest.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:32.940
Local outlier factor.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.420
Extended isolation forest.

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:36.760
They gave some really nice.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.740
Feedback.

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:38.460
On the book.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.960
So it's gotten.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:40.380
Yeah.

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:40.640
Quite.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.980
Quite good feedback.

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:42.660
So far.

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:43.980
And I think it's.

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.160
Probably.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.160
As comprehensive.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:47.820
A book.

01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:48.720
As you need.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:48.960
Like.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:50.620
I'll say.

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:51.360
It's quite comprehensive.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.580
I was going through it.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.500
Yeah.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:53.760
I think.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.520
Yeah.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.640
It covers what you would.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.060
Yeah.

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:56.680
Yeah.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.500
I think.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.800
Now.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.560
It does.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.540
It does mean.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.140
You know.

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:01.760
If you're not doing.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.620
Time series analysis.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:03.100
For example.

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:03.440
You can.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.460
Probably skip the chapter.

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:05.360
In time series analysis.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:05.640
But.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.420
Or deep learning.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.000
But.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.060
Most of it.

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:08.560
I think.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:08.820
Is.

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:09.380
Is actually.

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.580
There's a lot of gotchas.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.900
Without.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:13.620
Outlier detection.

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.060
I mean.

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:14.320
They're not.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.080
You know.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.120
Too hard to get your head around.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.280
But you do have to think about them.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.820
And.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:19.260
So.

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.060
It does cover.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:20.540
Pretty much.

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:21.300
Anything you want.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.440
Would need to know.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:22.800
I think.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.420
For almost any case.

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:25.200
You wouldn't need to.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.520
Look for too many other resources.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.820
After reading this.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.540
Yeah.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:28.900
Excellent.

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:29.220
And.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.340
Pyod is also.

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.340
Another good resource.

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.220
Maybe to get started with.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:32.540
You think.

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.780
I would.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.080
Yeah.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:34.560
I would.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:40.300
Depending on your situation.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:40.860
There's Pyod.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.260
Yeah.

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:41.600
And then.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.960
If you really need to go into deep learning.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.660
I would go into deep OD.

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:45.120
Or.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.700
Or even just Pyod.

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.000
And for time series.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:49.300
There's.

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.620
Quite a number of.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:51.200
Of libraries.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:51.960
You can use as well.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.560
Okay.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.200
Excellent.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.280
Well.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.620
Thank you so much.

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.340
For being on the show.

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:57.580
And.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.020
Sharing your work.

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:00.000
Well.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:00.560
Thank you very much.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.000
For having me.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:01.280
Yeah.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:01.840
That was very good.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.620
Yeah.

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:03.040
You bet.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:03.760
Bye now.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.760
Thank you.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:35.740
Thank you.
