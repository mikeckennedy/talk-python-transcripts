00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
- Hello, hello.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.340
Hey Sarah, hey Tushar.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.880
Welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.720
- Hello.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.780
- So good to have you both on the show.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.040
You know, when I saw the Djangonauts project,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.820
I think it was Brian Okken that had found it

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.060
and started talking about it on Python Bytes initially.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm like, oh, that is a brilliant idea.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.660
I definitely, definitely need to talk

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.700
to the people behind it.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.340
So, so glad to have you both here.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.340
You both are playing multiple roles in this whole process,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.940
which is fantastic.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.860
So excited to dive into the Djangonauts.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.700
- Amazing.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.620
I actually remember when that came up

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.780
and we were all got excited and we're like,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.500
how on earth did they find it?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.700
So really cool.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.260
- That entire show is just about finding stuff

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.340
that's interesting like that,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.220
that maybe doesn't get a light shown on it.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.380
And it's shining that light.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.220
So awesome.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.380
Glad, happy we're able to do it.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.300
And we'll do it a little bit more today.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.680
We'll make it the whole topic.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.900
How's that?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.820
- Awesome.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.700
- Yeah, indeed.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.100
Now, before we dive into all that,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.340
let's just start with your story.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.860
How do you get a programming?

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.060
What do you do these days?

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.260
Sarah, let's start with you.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.180
- Okay, yeah.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.300
So I am a Django developer.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.100
That's probably not surprising.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.100
I've been doing that pretty much my entire developer career.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.660
It's about five years.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.700
And about a year, two years ago,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.300
I started getting involved in open source contributions

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.260
to Django core.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.460
And now I'm part of the review and triage team,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.180
which is a fancy name for saying like,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.540
active core Django contributor group

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.740
or something like that.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.340
And yeah, why I'm here today is now we've got

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.780
the mentorship program that I co-organize.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.540
- Yeah, it's amazing.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.300
What kind of apps do you work on,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.780
have you worked on in Django?

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.420
Are you building APIs or what are you building?

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.420
- Yeah, good question.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.140
So originally, it was pretty much

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.100
the full stack Django experience with Django templates.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.540
And then I changed companies

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.140
and then it was with a React front end

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.420
and a Django REST framework API backend,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.180
which is perhaps quite a typical setup really.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.620
And I've changed again.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.940
And now I'm a developer advocate for JetBrains.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.940
So I no longer have to maintain a web application

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.420
so yeah, that's me.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.420
- Yeah, the dev relationship can't go down at night, right?

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.340
You're not gonna get woken up on a weekend

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.460
'cause somebody upgraded the database

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.060
and now your app doesn't work anymore.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.460
Now I'm a huge fan of JetBrains and what they're doing.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.780
That must be a fun place to work, I imagine.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.100
Yeah, indeed.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.100
Dushar, how about you?

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.380
- Hi everyone, so I'm Dushar Gupta, I'm from India.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.780
And I have recently graduated.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.780
I graduated in 2023, so that was my first undergrad course.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.940
And I currently work as a software engineer

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.420
at Samagra Governance and where we deal

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.380
with problems related to Indian governments.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.980
So we work alongside with the Indian government

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.020
and create solutions that helps them govern better.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.340
That's my day job.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.700
And I've been involved with open source

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.740
from my sophomore year.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.660
That was the place like, I was quite shocked seeing,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.340
wow, there are people who are there to help you for free

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.780
and you get so high quality code reviews just for free.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.700
So like, it was a full package for me.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.540
And I got into some fellowships

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.020
and one of the fellowships, I'm not sure if you've heard

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.580
of it was Major League Hacking.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.020
They ran a fellowship and in there I got introduced

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.780
to Django and to Carlton as well.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.700
And I think from there only Django Nodes got me

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.620
as one of the contributors trying to get into the code

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.140
and they reached out for the pilot program.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.580
So yeah, that's me and now I'm here.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.980
- Oh, wonderful.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.140
So you said you just recently started working

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.580
as a software developer professionally, is that right?

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.420
- Yeah.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.100
- Yeah, how are you liking it?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.180
- I think it's pretty good with,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.380
I've been always amazed with how much I can do

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.900
with my laptop and now that you have a job

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.900
which also kind of let you create some real impact.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.860
I can literally see students in public schools

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.420
using our apps, using our APIs to get better

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.260
at their normal courses.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.340
So yeah, it's been a complete amazing experience.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.580
- Yeah, it's definitely fun.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.380
I think the hardest part about software development

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.660
is getting your first job.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.820
And once you have a little bit of credibility

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.500
and experience, then it's kind of chasing

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.460
what you're interested in.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.420
But yeah, congratulations, that's excellent.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.260
- Thanks.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.380
- All right, well, let's dive in.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.300
But let's blast off, huh?

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.100
Let's blast off with the Django Nodes, right?

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.460
And you really have leaned into this space

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.900
and astronaut angle here.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.020
The website is django.space.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.020
We have navigators and captains and django-nots and so on.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.340
So yeah, very fun, very playful, I think.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.940
And that's on one hand, it's like whatever,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.780
what difference does it make?

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.020
On the other, I think it makes a difference, right?

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.940
Especially for people who are getting more into programming,

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.340
like it should sound fun because it is fun.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.020
But I think it just, it draws people in.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.660
It certainly did me when I heard about it, like I said.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.380
- Awesome.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.540
- Yeah, so Sarah, I'll let you introduce this whole program.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.740
It's pretty neat, tell us about it.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.740
- Sure, so I guess there's been a need

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:29.020
for more mentorship within the Django kind

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.780
of open source community for some time.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.780
And we have already participated in some other programs

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.740
like the Major League Hacking and Google Summer of Code.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.980
But sometimes we don't always retain people.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.260
We have a variable success.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.020
And there are still a bunch of people who appear

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.500
in our like help channels.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.820
And they're always like, oh, I'm interested in mentorship.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.820
Please help me, how do I get started, et cetera.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.580
And it felt like there could be more

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.900
that we could be doing there.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.060
And so this topic of we need a mentorship program,

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.700
we need a mentorship program came up a number of times.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.340
And eventually we launched Django.net Space

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.580
as our answer to that kind of need.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.740
We took heavy inspiration from the Kubernetes ladder program.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.060
So the Kubernetes community also has

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.860
their own contributor mentorship program.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.860
And that had like the concept of cohorts, for example,

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.540
which we've very much borrowed and things like this.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.060
So what we wanted to do was to design something

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.260
that could be quite lightweight and sustainable

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:58.140
as we wanna respect everybody's time that's involved

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.780
and kind of appreciate that the open source experience

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.020
is a little bit in and out.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.340
And you will, and that's kind of normal also.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.100
So anyway, what we are kind of iterating on

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.220
is we now have a eight week program,

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.460
which actually the next program starts on Monday.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.580
So we're just about getting everybody excited

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.340
and together for that right now.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.460
And in the program, we have Django-naughts.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.860
This is our term for mentees,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.140
like the participants of the program.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:44.420
And they will be assigned a navigator in like a team.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.980
So there's about a team of three mentees

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.660
or Django-naughts with one navigator.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.980
The navigator is a person who has

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.020
open source contributor experience

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.020
and some kind of background

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.340
that they can use to answer questions

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.940
and all this kind of stuff.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.820
- Do they have to be a Django core developer

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.740
or do you have to be even a contributor to Django?

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.940
Or do they, you know, if I would say--

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.780
- That's a great question.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.620
- I worked on Flask and I was really awesome at it,

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.060
but I also wanna help these folks over here.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.740
I'm really good at open source,

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.340
but not so much Django contributor yet.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.940
- So we have expanded the program.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.060
So in the pilot, it was originally just Django core

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.700
that we were focusing on.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.140
And now we have navigators

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.260
that have a focus on other packages.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.260
So for example, Tim Schilling is one of the maintainers

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.900
of Django debug toolbar.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.940
And Mark Walker is, I think he's the tech lead of Django CMS.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.740
And so we are kind of incorporating that.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.140
We wanna build a contributor base

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.660
to the Django ecosystem as a whole,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.660
because all of the packages really do help

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.580
and support Django.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.580
It's part of the real core value of Django as a framework.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.700
Is the other open source packages that are around it.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.700
And who knows whether we will expand even further later on.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.580
But I think really the thing that's key

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.020
is having a little bit of open source experience.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.900
And to be honest, a lot of it is transferable.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:46.900
So a little bit around etiquette for reviews,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.140
like don't at people all the time

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.540
and all this kind of stuff.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.100
- At channel, I don't know.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.140
- Things like that.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.500
We then have one other role, which is the captain

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.060
and they add another layer of support to the program.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:13.060
So these are, it's kind of like a supportive pastoral role

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.300
and they have more one-to-one sessions

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.420
with the Django notes to get to know them,

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.180
check that they're okay.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.820
And if there was anything that kind of,

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.060
they wanted to talk about,

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.300
but they didn't feel comfortable mentioning it

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.440
in a larger group.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.220
So we do have a discord chat

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.900
and we also have these weekly check-ins

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.780
that they have with the navigators and the team.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.500
But the captains one-to-one,

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.380
if you've got something that you,

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.340
perhaps you've been really poorly

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.820
and you wanna talk about that

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.020
and anything that comes up in life

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.100
that perhaps you didn't feel comfortable

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.540
announcing to the world,

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.420
can come up in with your captain.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.940
So they're really there to also normalize

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.740
any of the anxieties or feelings

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.540
that you have around working in public,

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.620
because if this is the first time you're doing that,

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.580
it's also a little bit vulnerable.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.340
So yeah, also shout out to the captains.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.420
- Yeah, awesome.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:29.260
I think that's a pretty powerful way to organize this.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.140
You've got a lot of support.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.900
The thing that strikes me about this

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.340
is it feels a little bit like a bootcamp,

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.620
like a coding bootcamp.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.780
I'm going to just take the next three months off

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.260
and dive into this,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.220
but way more lightweight than that.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.620
And also I think for other people

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.460
who might be thinking that,

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.900
it's worth pointing out that the goal

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.580
is not to teach people how to Django, right?

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.620
- Yes, 100%.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.100
- Yeah.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.940
Tushar, you wanna add to that as well?

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.700
You're shaking your head there.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.140
- Yeah, so Django.NET is not a bootcamp.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.260
I think we have been getting a lot of questions

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.100
around that as well,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.460
that whether it's a bootcamp,

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.620
whether someone would be taught how to Django,

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.060
but it's not like that.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.060
It's a, you can think of it as a program

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.300
which gives you the right support,

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.940
right people and right resources,

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.500
if you want to contribute to the core Django

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.940
or the Django ecosystem.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.180
So it kind of brings in all the right people together

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.060
for a short time

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.260
so that you can get the needed lift off that you want

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.220
and get started with the Django.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.140
- Yeah, so I guess the mental model people should have

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.420
is primarily the goal here

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.820
is to increase the contributors

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.220
to maybe Django,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.460
maybe as you mentioned, Sarah, a little bit broader,

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.300
like maybe you could contribute to Tim's project,

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.500
the Django debug toolbar.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.300
Just don't leave it on in production.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.380
And those types of things, right?

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.180
Like in the broader ecosystem,

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.900
bringing people in to contribute to Django more broadly.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.020
So it's specifically about creating people

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.140
who make those contributions.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:08.980
- Exactly.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.620
- And saying, I heard that programming is cool,

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.980
so I'm gonna quit my marketing job and do that.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:20.340
- Exactly, and I think a thing that,

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.180
'cause what is success?

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.660
It's such an interesting question

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:28.660
because we get random commits from people all the time.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:34.980
And really what, it's not necessarily

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.180
that there aren't going to be contributors to Django.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.420
Django is quite a big package.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.900
People will always come and suggest things

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.980
and give some code.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:52.860
It's more also around that Django has a community behind it.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.100
And the people who stick around longer term,

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.900
they feel like they're part of that community

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.420
and that they're part of something a little bit bigger

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.460
than just a commit in this cold,

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.380
heartless code base that's somewhere.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.220
And so if we can get people to feel like,

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.220
actually there are a bunch of real, very helpful people

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:23.300
who are working on Django and other packages around it,

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.580
and that you could interact with these people.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.020
And a lot of them are now my friends.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.860
I think it kind of is trying to show

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.180
that there's a lot more to it

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.260
and there's this value you can keep getting.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.460
And hopefully then people will stick around.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.100
And I think it's more the,

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.500
if you can stick around and do sustainable contributions

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.380
over a longer period of time,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.060
that builds up to something really quite huge.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.820
And yeah, I think for me, I find that really exciting.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.060
- Yeah, to me, Django,

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.780
more than almost any other sub community

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.340
of a programming world, right?

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:14.340
Not Python itself, but versus Flask, Lightstar, whatever.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.540
Other web frameworks, ORMs, whatever.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.540
It seems really to build a community around it

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.840
and not just technical excellence, right?

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.700
Like Django has a lot of technical attributes

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.460
that people are attracted to.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.300
I would, a lot of the Django people I talk to

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.500
are attracted because of the community and the support

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.500
and they just want to be part of that thing.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.340
That's amazing.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.500
- Yeah, I think you can see that

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.460
in the Django-Nod program itself.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.060
When I first got in, I thought,

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.420
meeting all the core contributors face-to-face,

00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.860
having chats with them and seeing problems that they face,

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.220
managing open source and then their actual job

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.740
and then the Django contributions.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:06.660
And now there's a program.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.340
So I can see how much they're putting into what's

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.820
maintaining and building this community

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.460
and how much they care about it.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.260
So it gives you a good inclusive feeling as well.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.580
And I found it really good.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.080
- Yeah, the only other,

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.700
I'm sorry if I'm leaving sub community out

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.540
that I just don't know,

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.640
but the only other part of Python

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.020
that I feel really has it as nailed as that

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.040
is the SciPy space.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.580
It seems like the Jupyter and the scientific computing side,

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.780
there's kind of a big community there.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.540
You've got NumFocus that actually funds a lot of that

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.240
specifically in that area, but it's pretty unique.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.220
Speaking about funding,

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.660
I don't see a pricing on your page here.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.760
What's the price?

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.320
- Oh, I wasn't prepared enough for this question.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:09.040
If we compared ourselves to Outreachy

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.520
or Google Summer of Code,

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.240
they do actually have a sponsorship

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.420
where they do pay the,

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.360
it's almost like a scholarship that you're going to work on.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.000
- Like an internship almost type thing, yeah.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.840
- Exactly.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.880
- A little internship.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.500
- And we don't have that money.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.600
We have been very generously given a grant

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.800
from the Django Software Foundation

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.560
to help us grow this program.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.320
And we will be using that in different places

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.560
in order to do that.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.560
But at some point we would like to gain sponsorship

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.420
from companies.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.220
So if you're listening and that's something

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.740
that you think would be a good idea,

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.180
then please get in touch with the organizers.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.420
That would be awesome.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.220
- Yeah, Sarah, you should go on a podcast

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.840
and let the companies know.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.180
- Yeah, that's a great idea.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.420
- Well, I think that's awesome.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.260
And it would be really,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.500
I do want to encourage companies out there listening

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.540
who have connections back to Django

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.740
or just want to get in front of Django developers

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.920
for whatever reason to do that.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.020
That would be awesome.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.740
- But it doesn't cost money to participate as a--

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.060
- Oh, 100%, no.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.220
- Django not, right?

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.180
- No, no, no.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.060
I mean, yeah.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.660
Back to what Tushar said at the very start

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:36.420
that he couldn't believe that you got these amazing quality

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.420
PR reviews from all these experienced engineers for free.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.460
I think open source is this incredible resource

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:50.460
where you can get very usable real life programs

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:55.060
programming experience ads, yeah, generally for free.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.180
So we don't charge people to be part of this.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.020
- That's awesome.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.700
And you can participate in very professional type of projects

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.580
without having to go through and getting a job

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.300
at a fame company or whatever, right?

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.240
You're just like, I'm going to be part of this,

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.240
this GitHub project.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.620
And it looks like they have continuous integration

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.220
and code reviews and these experts and so on.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.620
It's very cool.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.820
It's pretty magical, open source.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.660
Tushar, so originally you were a Django not,

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.940
and now you're coming back to pay it forward

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.640
a little bit afterwards.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.980
So let's start by talking about your experience

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.140
going through the program.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.740
Like, what were you thinking when you signed up for it?

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.140
What was it, and what was the day to day like,

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.940
and then what did you get out of it?

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.140
- So I think I got pretty excited when I saw this email.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.740
So I got an email, I think a few months back

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.100
saying that there's a program that Django,

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.660
program named Django not that is going to be started.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.860
It's a very small program.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.020
We are going to be in teams of three to four

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.780
and whether are you interested or not.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.300
So it was a complete yes for me that I'm totally interested.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.700
And I reverted back to the email and after a few days,

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.300
I got a selection email that yeah, you are finally in.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.900
I also shared it with some of my juniors

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.580
who are also trying to contribute to Django rest frameworks,

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.900
Django stubs and other projects to like,

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.140
here's the GitHub link of the program

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.580
that is going in a pilot mode.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.620
Just go and try out.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.420
So I think one of the other folks named Anwan,

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.860
she also got in, he's also now joining us as a captain.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.620
And during my phase of the Django not,

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.900
I think the best part of this program

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.380
that I've talked about a lot of times before as well,

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.020
the core difference that has on contributing

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.980
to different projects and joining in as Django not

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.420
was you were actually meeting real people.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.020
They were not just awesome GitHub usernames

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.620
that you know that you just talk over technically,

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.340
but you can really talk with them where they live,

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.340
how they look and just get on with what gets done.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:16.620
What got them started with the project and how they do stuff.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.260
So that gave me a kind of inclusivity,

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.140
a sense of belonging in the community that I know people,

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.020
I know Sarah, I know Sarah voice, I know Rachel,

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.220
I know a lot of people now, I know Tim.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:32.740
And it got me like, it gave me some kind of motivation

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.700
to just be keep like, just be involved

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.100
irrespective of like, not lose my motivation

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.820
and just be with the program.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.100
So during the Django not phase,

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.900
I contributed, I think a few PRs.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.100
There's one that's on the accessibility part of Django.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.980
I think it's in a work of progress.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.060
So it's just getting in slowly and slowly.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.820
There's some docs changes that I've done.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:00.300
And then there's another one that is just in preview.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.620
Another thing that I was getting out of Django not

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.540
was I know there is a focused group

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.780
that is communicating to me about my PRs

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.100
and how I can get better reviews.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.380
If the reviews are getting delayed,

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.540
I was getting active response on like,

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.780
the team is currently busy

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.380
or maybe there's a holiday season going on.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.420
Maybe there's a new Django major release that's going on.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.060
So team is not getting enough time to currently review it.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.380
So I didn't feel isolated or hosted out there,

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.540
but I knew like, there are people who are seeing this.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.420
And the whole experience was very good.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.100
Meeting a lot of new people and it was just fun.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.860
So that's how Django not worked for me.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.100
- Yeah, excellent.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.500
And you're going on to become a captain

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.500
for the next cohort, right?

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.700
So you're doing the one-on-one mentorship side of things.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:58.580
- Yeah, I think I wanted to...

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.860
So I asked when the Django not program

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.820
was about to be ended, I asked Sarah,

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.620
there's another Sarah.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.900
So I asked her, is there any way I can still be around?

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.980
And like, can this Discord group be continued

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.580
or are we going to just shut it now

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.900
as the program has ended?

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.060
So she told me that, no, we are going to have another cohort

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.260
and you can come in as a Django not captain if you want

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.660
and just meet other people.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.940
And I mean, I was like, why not?

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.740
Like, meeting a lot of new people.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.460
And there are a lot of people from that country

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.460
that I'm from.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.660
So that got me even more excited

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.020
that there were folks out there that I didn't knew of

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.420
and now I know them.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.340
So yeah.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.820
- Yeah, that's excellent.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.700
Probably you're more likely to go to conferences

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.700
where there's Django people meeting

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.980
and just generally be more part of the community, right?

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.500
Not just this.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.220
- Yep.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.420
Yeah, I completely agree.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.900
I think just the part Django not nailed completely

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.780
is like doing one-on-ones, video calls.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.220
It just gives you some sense of belonging.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.660
It's great to see people one-to-one and talk with them.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:13.900
So it's great.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.820
- Yeah, I mean like,

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:20.500
that you always notice it that after a DjangoCon,

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.300
so there's DjangoCon US and DjangoCon Europe

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.060
happens pretty much every year.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:29.180
We just had a DjangoCon Africa for the first time,

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.140
but we don't have a DjangoCon Asia

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.300
or a DjangoCon South America.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:39.300
And there are regions that don't have this opportunity

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.980
of a conference each year that the community

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.660
really gets together and that you meet people.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.180
And whenever you see the conference

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.580
and you see people afterwards, they're buzzing

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.140
and everyone's so excited to have gotten together

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:58.140
and to really reignite that kind of community feeling.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:02.180
But it's not accessible to everybody.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.900
And it's really nice for us to try

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.860
and recreate a little bit.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.900
It's not the same as a DjangoCon, of course,

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.940
but a little bit of that Django magic.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.860
If we can bring a little bit of that experience

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:22.860
to a wider group of people, I think it's really special

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.980
because I think that's really what Django is about for me.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.140
- Yeah, for every person that is pretty close

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.820
or pretty accessible to a local meetup

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.380
or a regional conference, there are many, many people

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:43.380
who work by themselves, live far from those places,

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.820
and these types of things serve a really important

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.700
connection to the community that way.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.140
Yeah.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.940
All right, Sarah, what about time commitments?

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.700
What's the day-to-day look like?

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.420
12 hours a day, what do you all do?

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.300
(laughing)

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.860
- Yeah, it's constant.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.700
Right, so that's one of the things

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.420
we really try to design also.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:15.420
We have, as a Djangonaut, it is self-managed

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.980
and self-guided.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.780
So with the amount of time commitment,

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.020
we're saying it's maybe four hours a week,

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.660
but it can really vary.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.660
So if you did two hours or maybe one week,

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.060
you decided that you were gonna spend your whole Saturday

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:40.060
or whatever, it can really be driven by that participant.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:45.920
We're not going to be there with a whip saying,

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.940
please do more or do less.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.140
Actually, the do less would be a concern.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.900
I mean, we do want to make sure that this is sustainable.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.700
And if we saw people, I don't know,

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.420
constantly working on something

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.820
without ever taking a break,

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.600
then that would be something that we would want the captains

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.140
and the navigator to go in and check that they're okay

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.940
and that they know it's not the end of the world

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.400
and that they can take a break.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.060
- Yeah, that happens to me when I get really

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.740
just super into something, usually some new technology.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.540
I'll just be working, working on it, take a break.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.660
Wow, I'm hungry.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.140
Oh, it's 'cause I haven't eaten for eight hours.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.300
What's going on?

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.980
But to me, it's kind of cool to get lost that way,

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.460
but you shouldn't set it as an expectation, right?

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.940
You're like-- - Exactly.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.780
Yes, exactly.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.400
And people work really differently.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.420
And if this is sustainable and it works for you,

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.060
then that's completely fine.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.900
But if it was that somebody said,

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.660
oh, I will probably finish this ticket,

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.440
and they said this in their weekly meeting,

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.920
and they thought, oh God, I have to finish it

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.700
by the next weekly because I said I would

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.820
or something like that, that's not what we expect.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.180
And that's completely fine.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:10.940
So yeah, maybe it's roughly four hours a week

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:11.780
for Janganots.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.220
Tushar would be a better person to ask that.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.620
(Tushar laughs)

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.900
- Yeah, you've recently been there.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.740
How was it?

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:21.660
- I think when I started Django,

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.640
when I started with the program, I was quite pumped.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.860
I went through all the trash tickets on the track

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.900
and made an ocean dock of tickets

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:32.180
that I wanted to take a look at and try,

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.460
but I soon got burned out.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.860
Then I think I had a session with Lily.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.980
I told her that I think I'm getting a bit burned out.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.780
So she told me that you can relax a bit.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.620
And she told her way of contributing to Django as well.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.500
So she told me that she has some burst of sprints

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.540
where she contributes.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.420
So it's like two PRs in a month,

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.820
and then another month there's no PR.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.460
So kind of works like that.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.480
But yeah, I think there's no pressure as such

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.620
for Janganots to work,

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:06.140
that they have to make a PR,

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.180
that they have to make contributions regularly

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.020
so they be part of the program.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.340
Everyone can work at their own pace.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:17.340
And you can also keep communicating with your navigators

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.780
and your captains to let them know what's working for you,

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.340
what's not working for you.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.500
And I think it's a pretty chill environment out there.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.980
So you can just figure out what works for you.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.660
So for me, I think burst of sprints worked for me.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.100
So I used to, so if I take a ticket,

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.180
I make sure that I get something going on,

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.260
and then I take some break,

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.980
and then I come back to Django,

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.900
and I keep context switching

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.420
between different open source projects.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.780
So that was how I got myself to the program.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.820
Yeah.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.660
- Excellent.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.260
Yeah, if you context switch too frequently,

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.980
you kind of just never really get going.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.940
You gotta be, save a little focus

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.740
and a little deep work on one thing.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:05.380
Sarah, Tushar mentioned choosing tickets to contribute to.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.340
You know, one of the things that's challenging

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.620
about projects like Django or any other project

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.780
that's been around that long with that many people using it

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.780
is it's really complicated.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.940
And any part that you change

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:23.940
can have really wide ranging consequences, right?

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.220
You don't wanna take down Instagram

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.020
just for a commitment, for a contribution, right?

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.420
So what I'm getting at is it can be hard as a beginner

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.340
to find the right issues to work on.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.620
How do you navigate that?

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:42.300
- So it is definitely a challenge,

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.820
and it's also a challenge to answer the question

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:50.820
because it's really dependent on the individual

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.380
and what are your goals.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:58.380
So if you wanna like achieve the,

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:03.300
I got a PR merged into Django batch, for example,

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.260
that's one potential goal.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.540
Or perhaps you're going,

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.460
no, I want to be able to have my name again,

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.860
like when I see when Django 5.1 goes out

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.340
and at the top there's like the major features

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.580
and like I want to have been a part of that

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.780
or something like that.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.500
Then it's kind of like a different dynamic to it.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.460
And so if you were one of the individuals

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.380
where you don't really mind,

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.500
you just want to contribute where you can

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.780
and maybe start small, for example,

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.020
just to get something in,

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.660
then there are different strategies to go about that.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.460
But the best strategy, in my opinion,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.420
is it's really common in,

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.260
I would say open source in general,

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:57.820
that people come along and they submit a PR

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.740
that they've done a good piece of work

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.380
and it gets a PR review

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.940
and maybe there were a couple of things

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.660
that needed changing.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.180
And then this person, for whatever reason, they vanish.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.380
(laughing)

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.180
Probably because of life or whatever it is.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:20.020
Or they just had enough energy to do that.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.420
And that's completely fine.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.260
And they didn't care about it enough

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.500
to do extra bits or whatever.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.060
- It could be they were trying to make Django

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.020
do something and they decided,

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.940
you know what, I'm gonna choose some other framework.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.780
- 100%.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.620
- Even some other language and they just left

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.460
and they're not gonna come back and polish

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.740
'cause you ask for reviews for better documentation.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:40.860
- Exactly.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:41.700
Exactly.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.220
And for example, and you've hit the nail on the head

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.660
with that because for Django to accept anything,

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.620
it needs tests, it needs docs.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.860
And so the code itself could be completely valid already.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.900
It could be like the perfect solution

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.020
for the issue you're trying to solve.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.020
But if it was missing the tests and the docs,

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.700
it wouldn't be accepted.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.980
And so what happens is, usually what happens,

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.380
is after a certain period of time,

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.220
the fellows might do a ping to say,

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.500
ah, do you still wanna work on this or something?

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.140
And then after another period of time,

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:22.540
they close it because it's gone quiet, basically.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:28.500
And so there are a bunch of these kind of unfinished

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:34.620
starting points that you can swoop in, take that,

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:38.340
and you've already got some code

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:41.020
and it gives you good context with like,

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.180
'cause sometimes people will share a ticket and they go,

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:47.860
I don't even know what file I should be in

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.660
to start to do this work.

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.020
Whereas if you took a PR that's got some code,

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.060
you know what file, what function,

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.780
you know what's going on there,

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.780
and you've got a lot more immediate stuff.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.820
- Yeah, yeah.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:03.940
You're like, this basically works.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.460
It needs some polish, maybe a little optimization

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.820
and the supporting stuff.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.220
Like that's a way smaller project

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.740
than imagine something you could add.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.660
- Exactly. - Out of thin air, right?

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.140
- Exactly, 100%.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.500
And then you can take those and you can be that person

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.060
that pushes it over the line.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.780
And obviously you credit the original author,

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.300
you can put them in as a co-author of the commit

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.580
and thank them.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:35.860
But it's a really good place to build from there

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.300
'cause then you can slowly get more context

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:42.100
about what does the process of doing a PR to Django

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:42.980
even look like?

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.580
Because you're gonna go through the PR review

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.460
and you will learn as you do it,

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.380
you'll learn how the documentation works,

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.700
you will learn how the tests work

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.940
and all that kind of stuff.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:01.380
The contributing docs are quite extensive and scary.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:06.060
And it takes a while to absorb all that information.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.420
And for me personally, I have to do it

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.140
to like really learn it.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:16.780
So I would say that's how I would suggest people get started

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.820
if that was your goal.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.420
- Yeah.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.140
- But, and this is how I got started,

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:29.140
but I would say it makes you like you're so scattered.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:36.340
So if I was trying to gain a really good,

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.820
solid understanding of Django,

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:44.820
I have a really weird picture that's being built

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.900
that I'm only getting like one pixel at a time

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.700
in very random spots.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.540
And so I can't--

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.980
- Maybe really deep down in the code base,

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.100
you know, I just connected, yeah.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.020
- I suddenly understand that one thing over there

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.500
that's really random,

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.140
but then this other completely unrelated thing over here.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:06.300
And so I'm not gaining like a depth

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.260
of a technical understanding of one section as a whole.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:15.260
So if you were someone who wanted to have that star feature

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.860
that you wanted to have your name against,

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:22.860
then really you should go and pick a section of Django.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.540
So if you went into the ticket tracker called track,

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:32.540
you can filter by components, so by an area of Django.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.500
- ORM or admin or something like that, right?

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.700
- Exactly like this, exactly like that.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.220
And then look at just the tickets for them

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:46.220
and they will be your practical way

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.540
to get that kind of information.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.260
But there's also sometimes,

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:54.340
there used to be a conference called Django under the hood

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:59.020
and you might find that there was a talk about forms

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.700
or something like this that's maybe relevant

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.900
and you should build up your knowledge

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.380
in like a much longer term perspective

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.260
that you're focusing on this area.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:15.300
And there might even be like other packages

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.780
that are related, so perhaps for example,

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.220
David Smith is also a major contributor to Django

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.220
and he is coming from like a forms perspective

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:31.300
and he is also a maintainer of Django Crispy Forms,

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.140
which gives them a lot of extra context

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.060
with how people use forms in Django.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:42.060
And so he can look at tickets and use that extra way

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:47.380
in that knowledge and his opinions

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.420
whenever people are discussing things.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.420
So that's a bit more of like a in-depth deep dive approach,

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.300
but it might not be the quickest way

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.980
for you to get your first commit.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.540
- Yeah, you wanna get that first early win or whatever.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:07.540
I really like the idea of reviving a stale PR,

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.840
that's pretty clever.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:12.060
All right, Tim chilling out,

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.220
audience has a quick question for you Tushar.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.100
Did you ever run into a wall in the Django code base?

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.100
How did you handle that?

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:22.020
It's a very large, very old, so I imagine parts are hard.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.220
I know I get stumped when I try old tickets.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:28.300
- Yeah, I think one of the tickets,

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.820
one of the issues that are currently out there

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.180
was an accessibility ticket.

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.980
So basically we want to increase the accessibility

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.260
of the Django admin.

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.420
And this is something that I also found it quite interesting

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.380
because it was a very interesting problem

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.940
to build a CI/CD pipeline that will take care of,

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:52.340
that will take care of accessibility.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.060
- When you say accessibility, are you talking multilingual?

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.660
Are you talking screen reader?

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.460
What are you talking?

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:04.460
- So Django serves a very large diverse audience

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.540
and there could be people who are disabled.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.700
There could be people who are colorblind.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.980
So you have to take care of putting out a software

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.500
that also caters to the needs of those people as well.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.700
So accessibility is, yeah.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.660
So basically there's a lot of thing in that.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:25.420
There's a specification that's out there

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:28.300
to define what is a good accessible software.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.420
And you can have a CI/CD that checks your project

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:36.300
with that software, with that specifications.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.900
So I think that was a very open-ended ticket

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.100
and I faced a very big wall on how to approach that,

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.300
what all is needed there.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.500
And the thing that I did was I reached out

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.540
to my navigator and captains when I was in the program

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.500
and they actually got me connected to the right people

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.100
and the right person to ping.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.900
So the track, they assigned the right people in the track

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.380
that should have been in the ticket.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:05.140
And I think someone from the Django accessibility team

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.500
came in, they gave me weekly updates

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.060
on what's the current status of this ticket,

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:11.940
what are we planning.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.180
They told me that this is going to be a low-chain ticket.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.300
It will spread out over a month

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.780
because we are planning on how to do this correctly.

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.860
And I think that's how I was able to get past that.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.780
The ticket is still open.

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.660
There's another package that has been abandoned

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:30.100
but we are trying to bring it in the Django ecosystem,

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:30.940
I think.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.220
So I think Mark is working on that.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.900
So that's how I basically get past the paywall,

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.540
like the ball of getting the contribution.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:46.540
And I think most of the time navigators were very helpful

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.100
because they have a lot of contribution

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.460
and they also helped me pointing to the right location,

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.260
where should I look to?

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.060
So I think one of the times, I think I reached out to Sarah

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.940
to just know why this specific ticket was closed.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.300
And I was not able to find what went wrong

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.180
so that this PR was reverted.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.860
And she pointed out to the right,

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.500
like the backtracking PR that you should take a look at.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.700
So this is how I generally just reach out

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.980
because that's what the program is for.

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:21.620
- Yeah, that highlights a super big advantage

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.300
or benefit of it, right?

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:27.100
A normal contributor can't just make all these connections

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.580
or even necessarily know who was involved

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.540
in the original effort.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.620
Why was it shut down?

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.140
Is it something the project doesn't want

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.500
or did people abandon it or none of that is accessible

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.580
from the less accessible from the outside.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.740
- Yeah.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.180
- Yes, I completely agree.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.020
- Yeah.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:49.980
So people have been listening.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.820
Maybe they're pretty excited to be part of it.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.220
Do you have another cohort coming along?

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.220
When's the next one?

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:04.300
- Okay, so we are just starting the first of the year

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.140
that was starts on the 15th of January.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:06.980
So if you want to,

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.820
if this is the first time you've heard about it,

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.580
unfortunately you're-

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.420
- Too late.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.180
- It's too late for that one, unfortunately.

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.380
That one's pretty much left the station, but-

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.340
- Well, I have a benefit for you

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.700
with a little bit of podcasting time travel.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.140
So this probably won't come out for six weeks.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:26.980
- Oh.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.260
- So on the main audio,

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.300
although it's already on YouTube for folks listening there.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.860
So it'll be a little closer to the start of the one

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:37.700
after if there's gonna be a third.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:38.740
- I see.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.700
Okay, interesting.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.500
Thank you for that tip.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:46.820
Then the best place to check at any point,

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.820
if you wanted to check if there is,

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.700
if we're accepting applications for a session

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:56.060
is you could go to the Djangonauts space website

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:01.060
and then click on sessions.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:06.060
And when you click on sessions, you will see, exactly.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:10.020
Right now you can see that the session that we have is,

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.700
if you scroll a bit further down on the screen,

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.540
we're sharing this session

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:20.460
and you can see the latest information of the applications,

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.860
when it starts and all the details

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.540
about that particular session.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:28.820
And so whenever we agree to do a new session,

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:34.180
that will appear on our website

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:38.300
and there will be this apply button essentially

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.420
when applications are open.

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:45.020
So in six weeks time, that might be the case

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.820
that we are accepting new applications.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:53.820
There is also a interest form that we have

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.700
and so again on,

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:01.740
there's, yes, if you click back on sessions at the top,

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:05.420
there is a join us secret button.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.100
Yeah, exactly.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:13.100
A top tip and here you can send us your email

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.900
and what this just means is we will send you an email

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.340
as soon as applications open for the next session

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.380
and then you will be the first to know.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.620
The other thing is we're on social media,

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:30.060
we're on X and Mastodon and LinkedIn.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.300
So followers on all of those places

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:38.300
and we will also post there for everything when that's.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.140
- Yeah, definitely.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.620
And I'll put those in the podcast show notes

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.320
so people can click on them and find all these things.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.600
It also seems you all are on YouTube.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.060
What happens over on YouTube?

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:58.900
- We are on YouTube and amazingly we gained some followers

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.180
before we've even really done anything,

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.500
but this is our plan.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:08.060
So also in a session,

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:13.060
we have a couple of guest speakers who come

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.900
and the Django Notes can,

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:21.220
they will usually talk about some topic

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:25.540
and they've got some particular experiences

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:26.940
that they can share

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.620
and that you have a little bit of a Q&A with them.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:34.260
So in the pilot session, both Marish and Natalia

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.580
who are the two Django fellows,

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:40.980
they had a session with our Django Notes

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.520
and we record these sessions.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:47.740
And what we want to do is we want to publish these

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:52.100
on YouTube to make that available to everybody

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.700
because there's quite interesting information

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.300
that gets shared in these talks

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.900
and the whole aim of open source

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.100
is to share information really.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:07.980
So that is the main plan for the YouTube channel,

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.460
but we're not there yet,

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.940
but maybe by the time the podcast is published,

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:13.780
there will be loads of you.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.020
- You got a few weeks to work on it.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.180
That's cool.

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.540
So people can, they can smash the subscribe

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.540
and crush the bell over there?

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.380
- Absolutely.

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.980
- Yeah, that'll be cool.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.580
So how many people are in the next cohort,

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.420
the 2024 first cohort?

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:36.060
- Yes, there is 18 Django Notes.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.540
So we've really scaled up since the pilot.

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:44.460
Yeah, so that's six teams.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.020
Whereas last time we had two teams, so quite a few more.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:49.860
- Yeah, that's cool.

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.740
What's the cross team story, right?

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.380
Like I can imagine, say like some kind of startup accelerator

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.220
where there's groups

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:01.060
but sometimes they get together and present to each other

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.380
what they're building, what they're doing.

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.500
Like, is there something like that

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:07.940
where the teams cross pollinate or whatever?

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.260
Yeah.

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.060
- We have, you're in the same discord

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.980
and we have channels that are available to everybody.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:19.980
And we are trying to achieve both a community feel

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.740
and that you can work with other people.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:26.620
So we do have a life channel where people share things

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.300
about, I don't know that they went on a run

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.020
and it's a little bit more around the humanizing

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.820
the individual and all this kind of stuff.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:40.820
But there are channels which are about works work, I say

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.620
but contributing specifically.

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.740
So on tickets and people can share the work

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:52.660
that they're doing and say, hey, I want some input on this

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:55.300
or does anybody wanna work together with me on that?

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.260
And there's nothing stopping a Django knot

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.420
from working with another Django knot

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.660
who's in a different team.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:07.660
The team is just a structure to give you a group

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:13.140
that is manageable for one human to look after.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.140
And for you to have a meaningful discussion

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.540
in a smaller group.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.220
- You can see a big, it just becomes a bunch

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.300
of anonymous people that happen to be in the same program.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.140
Yeah.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.220
Yeah.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.140
William out there has an interesting question.

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:33.020
As you talk about adding more than before,

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.500
what are your plans on scaling this?

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.940
And what do you feel are limiting factors?

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:43.100
- That's a really awesome question, William.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:48.100
So limiting factors are usually getting mentors

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:55.380
who agree to do it at the same time.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.980
And it's interesting as to whether we continue

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:01.020
to organize it, that it's a session

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.780
that everyone is there at the same time

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:08.780
or whether we allow it to no longer be a single cohort

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.660
and that somebody could be like, right,

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.260
there's two people who are available

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.740
from this state to this state

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.300
and therefore they can look after a few Djangonauts,

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.140
for example.

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.140
That could be an option for us to prevent

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:28.140
this larger cohort because it means

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:32.380
that we're trying to get a group of, I don't know,

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:36.260
eight volunteers who can all do this time period

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.780
at the same time.

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:40.380
And that's a challenge.

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:46.380
And we did struggle to, we got a reasonable amount

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:52.260
of people raise their hands to be mentors,

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:55.060
but we could always do with more of them.

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:58.820
So if anyone wants to do that,

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.420
we would love to hear from you.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:06.660
So that's another thing that kind of limits that scale.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:11.100
And the other thing is, is we are learning

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:12.540
the challenges as we go.

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:16.780
So fortunately we haven't had any issues yet.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:22.060
We have, for example, a code of conduct

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:25.660
and there is a way that people could report something

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:28.740
that we should be aware of.

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.420
And we haven't had that report yet.

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:33.820
Touch wood, it will never happen.

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:36.580
But there's some things that we,

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:41.580
it will take a few iterations for us to really test,

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:45.620
stress test our processes and check that this is gonna

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:50.140
be capable of scale, but yeah, who knows?

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:50.980
We're not there yet.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:54.580
- Well, you know what, one positive feedback loop

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.820
is people like Tushar who went through it,

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.780
but now are supporting its growth, right?

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.940
- Yeah, definitely.

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:09.260
- Yeah, and a question for you from Sarah Tushar's.

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.420
I saw multiple, or at least one person out in the audience

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.300
saying, "Hey, I'm gonna be in the next cohort."

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.940
So do you have any advice as a former Djangonaut

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:20.900
for new ones who are about to get started?

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:27.460
- Yeah, I think one of the important advices

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.340
would be to have a lot of fun.

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.500
You can contribute to Django,

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:34.420
but also you'll make a lot of good connections.

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.420
So also be around in the Django Discord,

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.300
Django Djangonauts Discord, interact with people,

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.660
talk with each other, attend the sessions,

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.460
just get to know them a lot.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:51.420
Because the three weeks, the amount of time

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:54.180
that you'll part of the Django program will be,

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:57.860
they'll focus on getting you left off,

00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:01.700
but you should plan on making this program more sustainable.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:04.500
So just try to be around,

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.140
keep talking with different people and have fun.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:10.620
- Good advice.

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.180
All right, let's round this out with,

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.980
what are the benefits for the people who are participating?

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.980
And I suppose also navigators and captains.

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:25.740
One thing I see here that would be really a bonus

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:30.180
is just the edge it gives you in working

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.900
in web development in Python

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:35.820
as a job opportunity going forward.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:41.420
If you say, yes, I know how to do a database query

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.700
with the Django ORM, please hire me.

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.140
That's one thing.

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.600
It's another to say, I added that feature

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.420
that you're excited about.

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.100
Can we talk about my position?

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.700
Okay, everyone else is off the table,

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.180
as long as you're a decent fit.

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.700
That all of a sudden just puts you in a different

00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:00.980
stratosphere, I guess, sticking with the theme.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:05.580
So maybe you all could speak a little bit to

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:08.480
advantages beyond just, I want to contribute to open source

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.520
and have the badge or whatever it is.

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.720
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:18.720
I think my first job was basically like no interviews,

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.500
just based on open source profile.

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:25.900
The company or the current company that I'm part of

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.540
also have some open source products.

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.260
So I was just involved with that.

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:31.940
And the job was just a simple,

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.900
like one-on-one kinds of conversations

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:37.100
on whatever projects or different opposite contributions.

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.140
- Okay, it's a shark.

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:40.140
It seems like you're doing this for free.

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.560
How about we pay you to do this?

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.160
Okay.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.000
You convinced me.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.360
- Yeah, so yeah, that's what actually happened.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:55.000
So I think you get a lot of,

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.300
I mean, contributing to open source,

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.140
you get a lot of visibility.

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.300
There are a lot of people that reach out to you.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.980
And I think the best part of it is,

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:07.380
as I said it before, you just grow compoundly.

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:10.380
There's no stopping when you get started with this stuff.

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.260
Initially, there's a barrier that you have to push

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:14.100
before you get started.

00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:17.040
But I think Django will do that work for you

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.580
to help you push that initial barrier,

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:20.900
get the inertia moving.

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:24.920
And then it's all just a good walk down the path.

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:29.220
- Yeah, and to add to that,

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:32.980
even beyond getting your first job

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.620
or getting your foot in the door,

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:39.420
if you're with certain roles,

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.100
you might come to a point where

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.860
there's usually this learning curve, right?

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.820
Where at the start you learn loads

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.580
and then it really levels off and you've become efficient

00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.180
and you kind of know the processes

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:53.300
and you've been asked to make

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:56.860
yet another API endpoint for something.

00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:00.220
And it's kind of fairly,

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:04.140
you're not learning so much as you were in the early days.

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:04.980
- Go with me here.

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:07.180
What we need is we're gonna need a grid

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.140
of the things in the database

00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.020
and I need you to be able to edit in the...

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.100
Okay, like the five other ones I just spoke.

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:12.940
Got it, okay.

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:13.780
- Exactly.

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:14.600
- That kind of thing, yeah.

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.440
- Exactly.

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.880
And I also get it that,

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:21.320
and companies don't necessarily want you

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.600
to experiment too much

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:26.760
because experiments are risky and all this kind of stuff.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.080
So depending on when you work,

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.480
maybe you've got lots of opportunities

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.200
to learn lots of new stuff,

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.200
but some people will be in a position where

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.220
actually they go,

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.360
oh, I don't feel like I've learned anything this year

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:42.600
or something like that.

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:47.600
And I think open source or contributed to Django particularly

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.760
like it's so big

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.880
and there's so much there

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:56.120
that you can really learn about if you want to.

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:59.280
And completely with no pressure,

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:02.520
at your own pace and with really friendly people.

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:03.680
And so there is,

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:07.200
if you engage in that,

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:10.080
as a practice,

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.280
it can also give that you

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.880
the joy of programming again,

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.920
that you can go,

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.960
you know what, this is a really tough problem

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.160
and I can really think about this

00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:23.200
and it's not like a problem that's screaming at me

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.760
that needs to be fixed straight away or whatever.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:26.640
But, you know,

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:30.420
and I think there's lots of those opportunities in there too.

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:33.080
- Absolutely.

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.440
That's always a struggle is,

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.120
you get to work for some company and they're like,

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.200
yeah, we're not changing that.

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.120
That works.

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.040
We're not messing with that.

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.640
We're not ready for Python 2.7 yet.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.480
We're still on 2.6.

00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.000
So let's just calm down there.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.560
(laughing)

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:48.600
Okay, sure.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:52.080
I see some other people asking,

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.520
is this a Discord?

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.480
This is a private Discord for the cohort.

00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:00.200
It's not something public that others can participate in.

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.020
- That's true.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:04.120
There is a Django Discord that is public to everybody

00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.720
and I would recommend joining there.

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.920
So please do.

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.160
And a lot of people are in both.

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:12.600
And if you dropped into the

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.640
contributing getting started channel

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:17.840
or the contributor discussions channel

00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:19.840
and you were to talk about a ticket,

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:23.480
it's very likely that I and other Django contributors

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.460
are going to engage with you directly.

00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:27.840
So there's that.

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.840
But the Django.space Discord is designed for the cohort

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:36.840
to give people a little bit of a smaller community feel

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.880
and allow them to feel comfortable

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:43.400
sharing the pictures of their dogs and things like that

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.720
when they're very new to this.

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:49.120
So yeah, that's how it's working.

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:49.960
- Excellent.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.200
All right, let's wrap this up really quick

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:56.440
with just one sort of broader thing.

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:59.560
Maybe there's many other communities out there listening.

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.600
I wish we had a not,

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.980
some kind of astronaut type thing for us.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.200
What advice would you give to other open source communities

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.820
that maybe wanna have this type of thing?

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:14.620
- Give it a go.

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:15.460
Really try it out.

00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:19.120
I think we're very happy for people to take,

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.240
I mean, all of our documentations are on a GitHub.

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.160
It's all open source.

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.760
Please take it and make it your own.

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.340
You can use different names.

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:33.320
And keep in touch with us and tell us what works for you

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.880
and what you've changed and what's better.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:42.080
And yeah, for us, we wanted to start off

00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:45.720
with something quite lightweight and basic.

00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.880
And when we started, for example,

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:53.200
we, okay, we had a name, but no one knew who we were

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.040
'cause we just invented it.

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.400
And for example, with Tashar,

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:58.700
we reached out to some individuals.

00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:02.760
So in the past, when we'd seen some people be interested,

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.440
those were the first people we contacted.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.280
So you can start really small, really basic.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.320
You don't have to have a launch

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.200
where you're accepting applications

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.400
'cause when you have applications,

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.440
you need to figure out

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.000
what does an application even look like

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:15.840
and then how you're gonna review it.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.200
- Right, what are the criteria?

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.720
Yeah, all that. - 100%.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:22.840
So start small and then you can build it out

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.180
in a way that works for you and see how it goes.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:29.660
- All right, well, excellent.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.160
I think that's probably it for all the time we have today,

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.560
but I wanna congratulate you both

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.800
on this really cool community you built

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.680
and are building.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.080
Final call to action, people are excited about Django Nauts.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.180
What do you tell them?

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:49.040
- Oh, just, yeah, followers on our social media

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:54.040
and please do apply when we have sessions.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.680
We really, really appreciate all the applications

01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.120
that we receive and mentors are always wanted

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.200
and needed, so get in touch.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.360
Yeah, please.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.360
- Yeah, of course.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.000
Go to the session section and click join us

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.680
and fill out the form if you think you might

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.940
in the future want to be part of it, right?

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.960
Indeed.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.700
All right, Sarah Tushar, thank you for being on the show

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:24.000
and thanks for sharing your project.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.400
It's very great.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.080
- Thank you, Mike. - Thanks, Mike.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.200
- You bet, bye.
