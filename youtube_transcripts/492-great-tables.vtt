00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.480
Rich, Michael, welcome to Talk Python To Me. Great to have you two here.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.380
Hey, thanks for having us.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.000
Great to be here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.460
Yeah. It's a pretty interesting topic, these tables.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.680
You know, when I first heard about it, I was like, I was like, you know, it sounds interesting,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.520
but how are we going to talk about tables on the podcast?

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.880
And, you know, how much is there really to talk about with tables?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.100
Turns out there's a lot and we're going to find a way to talk about it on the podcast.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.080
So it's a pretty deep topic.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.860
There's so much. You're going to need two hours.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:44.560
And honestly, like what you said just now is like story of my life for the past year of like being like, what could tables do?

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.260
Yeah. I mean, df.head, doesn't that just solve it? Come on.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.140
We already got that.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.980
We already live. It's already so perfect. How could we improve on that?

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.340
But yeah, I'm really excited because this is this is me kind of like fanning over rich.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.680
But like, I think it's like the perfect way to frame it. Like what's up with tables?

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:18.640
I feel like having pulled that thread for the last year, I'm always excited to talk about these things here because like I don't even be able to recapture how freaked out I am by whatever I just experienced for the past year with tables.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.640
Incredible.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:32.500
You know what I would say probably my impression, which I will grant you is a pretty fresh take on this.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.880
It's a little bit like, oh, well, we already got Excel. You can draw graphs with Excel.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.680
Or Altair, Plotly, those types of, you know, it's like, oh, wait, there's actually a lot more we could do. That's pretty awesome.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.080
Yeah.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:57.320
We have language too. I feel like having discovered there's a whole vocabulary for tables, I feel like was really enlightening.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:13.980
Yeah, I would think so. There's, there's almost like design patterns of tables. We're going to get into that and like structure and some history and many things. But as per usual, before we jump into that, let's get a little bit of background on you guys.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.060
You know, maybe quick introduction on the two of you, how you got motivated to get into work with great tables and that sort of thing.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.780
Yeah.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.500
Rich, you want to?

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.880
Yeah. So I'm rich.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.520
How do you get into tables? I mean, I had to make tons of them. So that was sort of necessity.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:45.860
So the problem was, it was annoying to do, like really annoying. Either doing a word was repetitive, you know, not reproducible, which kind of annoying me. I had to redo tables all the time.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.500
Because we had to use a tool that was outside of like programming, right? That was like a major problem, actually.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.680
You had to retranscribe them. There's many of them. It was kind of blah.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.540
So I swore.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.580
Like kind of like I opened with, you could automate the graphs, but you couldn't automate the tables, right?

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:18.440
Exactly. Yes. It was like the one last thing. So that was like where I came from with tables. And years later, I finally got to it. I mean, better late than never.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:39.080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I came in mostly to support rich. So a lot of what I've done is work is like a data scientist in R and Python. And I've, I've always kind of had a split, been kind of split brain. So doing a lot of data analysis in R and more engineering tasks in Python.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:56.560
But I think as, as I noticed, Rich was kind of bringing this table idea to Python. I talked with him a bit. And then I peeked through the code he was working on. And I was sort of really intrigued by how much was there.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:10.620
Like I would say the first thing that really kind of surprised me is just how much code he had was just more than I kind of thought tables would need. And so.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.060
This is more than one file. I mean, come on. Don't we just put out a header and put out the rows?

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.560
It was kind of like.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.800
There's a lot going on here for people who are not familiar with this.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.220
Yeah. Right.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.100
I surprised myself too with how much I wrote. I mean, it just kept snowballing the amount of things that had to be done.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.340
Yeah. I'm sure.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:42.380
And we did, we both came from academics. So we both did PhDs and I think we both produced like a decent number of tables as we did that.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:51.800
But yeah, never, never quite dove as deep into them or as intricate.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.440
Yeah. And probably most of the time, you know, you're knocking out something in Excel or LaTeX or something like that.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.320
Yeah.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:10.080
Once it's done, it's kind of done. It's not, not live in the sense like every day I want a new tabular view of the status or, you know, whatever, like the dashboard sort of deal.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.820
What were your PhDs in?

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.000
I did a chemistry of all things.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.460
Chemistry. I love chemistry.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.880
Yeah.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.460
Yeah.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.760
Yeah.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.520
Organic chemistry was one of my favorite courses I ever did in college.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.020
I loved it too. Yeah. Organic was great.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.200
Yeah. Beautiful.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.860
Yeah.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.640
Yeah. And I know, I know very little about chemistry. I did cognitive psychology.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.340
So.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.660
Okay.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.740
Tables in the mind or something. I don't know.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.260
Something like that.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.620
Yeah, absolutely. That's cool.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:47.940
So you must have had a lot of experience with trying to present your research and your thesis and stuff through, through tables, right?

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.680
Yeah. Big time.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.580
I think it counted like something like a hundred tables, including that the raw data section.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.300
So yeah, no shortage of tables there. And a lot of it came up in presentations and stuff. Had to remake them.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:09.240
Again, no, no good tool. So I was like, I felt like, I felt sad, but I had no time to like pursue.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.940
A tool. So I just kept going.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.220
Yeah.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.060
I will say too.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.000
I kind of picked up too, as I started working with Rich, that he's a supreme dabbler.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.960
Like he has collected tables from across the world in a lot of different domains.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:38.340
So that's, that's one thing that caught me too, was like, I don't doubt he produced a lot of chemistry tables, but I was amazed that I felt like he was like a guy in an alleyway trying to like,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.980
sell me tables. Like, Oh, you like a sports table. He's like, Oh, you like basketball. You know, you like,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.920
yeah, the, the, the first, the first brackets free. And then.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.980
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:11.940
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So how do we kick this off? We got to, I just want to say to all the listeners who are not watching the YouTube live stream, but are just listening. Like most people who listen to the show do.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:20.060
We're going to do our best to describe some of these things. Some of them are visual, but I think we can pretty much capture the essence of them.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:39.100
I will try to set up chapters and put some chapter, chapter art. So keep an eye on your podcast player or your CarPlay view of now playing or whatever it is that's playing the thing. It might show, show some pictures. we'll see what we can do with that.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:46.480
But let's start off the conversation here, not on great tables exactly, but maybe just some examples of some good,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:53.660
good tables to give people a sense of just, you know, what more could you possibly do than just,

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.780
you know, data frame dot header, something to that effect. You know what I mean?

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:08.220
Um, so I think it was rich. He sent this over, what do you guys said? A visualization gallery from Andrew Weatherman.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.260
And it includes tables.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.500
Yeah. It has got some awesome tables.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.460
And the first thing is a table.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:27.820
Yeah, there are, 10 tutorials here and there are a lot of them are based on, code, a lot of them from R and stuff like that. But which one should, which one do you think we should talk about just as an introductory example, maybe?

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:33.620
Pretty good one is the first one. The very first, like it leads with a table at the very top of the page.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.120
Yeah.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.360
So the conference realignment travel.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:38.880
Yeah.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.080
Okay.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.120
Yeah.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:49.260
So if you, yeah, if we open this table up, there is, there's pictures that like, so this talks about like, what is this?

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.520
A basketball college, American basketball.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.380
Yeah.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:09:07.820
So you've got the, the logo or the icon, you know, like the Stanford tree or the Miami, Florida, you, which is like, the, the, the school colors.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.280
And then you've got little chiclets of the information.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.580
It's those are also embedded in sort of a heat map.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:23.020
There's a lot more that there's a lot of pieces of this conveying information all at the same time.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.700
You want to maybe just riff on that a little bit.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.220
Yeah.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.880
I don't mind trying to tackle this table.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.000
I'm just taking it in.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.660
I think, I think it's really nice.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.880
So this table, yeah.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.500
Basketball realignment travel in the ACC.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:44.600
So they're talking about, I guess, how hard would it be for these teams to drive to games?

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:51.500
And so in the table, every row is a team and, they use like the logos next to the team name.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.060
So it's really fast to look up.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:59.340
And then in the columns are things about like, yeah, visiting arena to home arena.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:06.520
So like how, how many miles would it take for this team to travel to the arenas they're going to?

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:20.780
Um, and I think that what's nice about this table is, for example, there are multiple measures of how many miles it would take a given team to go to their visiting arenas.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:32.820
So for example, on the first row, we have California and in columns, we have like median miles for one column and average miles for another column.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:44.640
Um, but I think what's nice about just kind of basic table structure is because these two columns, medium miles and average miles are both kind of about a similar thing.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:52.400
They're able to put a label over it called a column spanner and they label it visiting arena to home arena.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.960
So they're able to do a little bit of grouping of information.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.960
So you can see like these two measures, these two columns are related to each other.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:10.480
And then I like, yeah, Michael, that's a super interesting point that I think is very well represented in great tables.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.100
And that is almost multi-dimensional data.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.100
Yeah.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.740
Right.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:23.320
And so, like you say, it's got three columns here, median miles, average miles, and then this other geographic center column.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:36.620
But above those, there's like groupings, like these two columns speak to how far is the visiting arena from home versus the other one is just sort of a, an extra description.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.040
Right.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:48.020
So you're able to say, here's, here's this axis of information, but you can really group them together and think of them as something else it's representing almost, or something combined, like a projection.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.160
I don't know, something like this.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.000
Yeah, totally.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:58.980
And I think the interesting thing too, is like in databases or in data analysis, this kind of structure is there, but it's not visual oftentimes.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:12.460
Like someone might have a table and they might have two columns, one for like median miles, average miles, but they might actually like, oftentimes people in the name will put the grouping.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:19.720
So like, if those two columns are related, they might say like visiting, you know, prefix it with like visiting underscore.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:29.500
And so, it's interesting, like tables, raw data tables often have these hierarchies, but this kind of lets you pull it out visually.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.200
So like the human eye can quickly kind of group things.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:44.860
And then to your point about multidimensional, that is kind of like one of the big benefits of a table is that this, for example, this table has three columns.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.280
Related to miles.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:55.520
And a plot, you could show that in a plot, you could, you could plot two columns against each other with a scatter plot.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.040
And maybe use the third column another way through like color or size.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.660
But you're at that point, you've kind of maxed out the plot.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.800
There's not a lot more you can do.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.400
A table, you can just keep adding columns.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:14.640
And they don't even have to be numeric or like kind of on the same scale.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.480
You could add like all kinds of information in columns and keep going.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:29.460
And I think to your point of it being multidimensional, that's one kind of nice thing table support is many measures on the columns.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.280
Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.620
Yeah.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:40.380
Out of the audience, Carol points out that the ACC used to be mostly southern based, but now they span the whole US.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:55.420
But what you can see from this chart is all, or this table rather, that all the southeast based universities have a much easier time.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.580
Right there.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:03.260
The color of their little chiclets of distance are all very light colored.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:11.480
Whereas if you look at all the California West Coast, you know, it's like distance across the US is your average distance you travel to each game.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.640
Right.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.720
And it's pretty wild.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:26.160
You could probably put in things like what is, you know, what is the team's typical winning outcome based by distance?

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:26.420
Right.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:32.020
If it has to play a team that is twice as far away, is it more likely to show up?

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.460
Are the players more likely to show up tired and not quite be able to play as good?

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.880
And then that might somehow affect the rankings just based where you physically are located.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.460
Yeah.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.580
I just want to make this a good table because like it basically tries to get that slice of the data.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:48.880
Right.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.200
That one view of the data and present it so nicely.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.740
And then you can cause you to think those things.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:55.980
Right.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.880
To to explore.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.240
Yeah.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:57.880
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.480
I don't know.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.980
I would have even thought that before.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.420
Yeah.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.300
Yeah.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:19.540
But looking at the colors, you're like, oh, California, as in Berkeley and Stanford and those types of schools, they're much darker versus, you know, Louisville, which is not very much or Duke or all these other teams.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.040
And then you start to realize like, oh, maybe distance does play an important role.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:31.320
It's just jumps right out, even though this is not a thing that I think about or care very much about on a lot of levels.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.040
But, you know.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:32.980
Yeah.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:44.480
And even to Michael's point, that last column is like a total, like qualitative measure or not qualitative, but it's basically just like a, it's like a label rather than like a number, essentially.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.540
And so like, it's much easier in a plot.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.760
I don't even know how you would do that.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.760
Yeah.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.620
I guess.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.460
But here you can.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.540
Just to describe the last column is you're talking about like furthest.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.900
So the last column shows what's the furthest team from.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.200
So each row is a team.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.480
The last column is essentially what's the furthest team from you.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:11.860
And they're able to just put a logo in to get a quick kind of snapshot and on that extra column.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.080
Basically, if you were to play an away game at that team, that's the worst travel for you.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.340
But at least measured by distance.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:27.420
If not like by time and, you know, like if you're taking a flight, you could have three connections to a small town versus a direct one that's far away.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:27.600
Right.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.000
Like there's different metrics you might apply to what defines furthest.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.180
But yeah, it's a neat idea.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:33.920
Yeah.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.640
It's interesting though.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:34.780
Right.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.760
Because they even put bother to like rewrite the name of that team.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.760
They just economize the space and just like threw it in in case you're interested.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.720
Yeah.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.020
Yeah.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.200
And the value for that column is not the name of the school.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.800
It's the school logo.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.360
Yeah.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.280
Yeah.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:17:00.300
And I will say I can't believe that the year is 2024 and we just had a five minute discussion on the design of a single.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.400
I didn't imagine myself being here a year ago, but it's really.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.560
This is a problem, isn't it?

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.800
To me.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800
Yeah.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.600
Yeah.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.360
Amazing.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:19.120
I feel like Edward tough day must come, come into existence a lot for you guys.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:19.400
Like.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.620
But it kind of goes to show tables can be cool, right?

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.340
Like we're actually talking about this table and.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.220
It's interesting and it's good to look at.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:28.900
And like.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.740
I don't know.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.980
Like this is like a leisure thing.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.560
I'm not compelled to look at this.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.400
Yeah.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.320
I'm looking at this for fun.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.880
And like it actually is okay.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.360
I enjoy looking at this table.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.240
Yeah.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:41.560
Yeah.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.020
I'll pull one more down.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.220
I have no idea what I'm going to be getting here, but let's do Spotify listening.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.780
How long do I listen to my top artists before skipping?

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:51.820
Yeah.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.360
I think your Tufty point too.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.340
This is a good example that you can have.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:00.300
You can have a little bar chart inside your table.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.920
So like this, this table, how long do I listen to my top artists before skipping?

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.980
Each row is an artist.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.920
Um, with some information about them.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:23.120
Um, and then the big thing it sounds like is this average stream duration column, which has a bar of how long people stream them on average, maybe before skipping.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.340
Yeah.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.560
I love your point about Tufty.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:36.420
Like this idea that you can encode a small graph, like visual, like a bar is very, I think Tufty, like with spark lines and things like that.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:43.560
Tables can have a really compact representation that bring in some of the value of charts.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:51.160
Um, but also it's like, it's like three quarters table, one quarter chart.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:19:00.620
And that's kind of, for those out there who don't are not steeped in Edward Tufty sort of lore.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:11.140
He's a guy who thinks very deeply about data presentation, not necessarily tables or graphs or whatever, but just, I have a bunch of kind of data stats based information.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:17.940
And how could I possibly present this in the way that conveys the most information easiest?

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.480
So on.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.660
So yeah, he's got, he's got some great books, some great presentations out there.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.080
Um, that's why I brought it up.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.340
Cause it's his whole career is about how do you present data basically.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:31.580
Right.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.380
And if you guys should add to that, what do you think?

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.260
I think there is a, I don't have it on hand.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.080
There is a quote I think from Tufty.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:49.820
I don't want to butcher about there is some analysis he's done of tables of like, like your entry architecture or something, which is essentially like the structure of the table.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.280
Where you enter it as a user.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.680
And then like how you read usually determines your like orientation.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:03.600
So like, if you're, if you're reading left to right, there's usually like the table structure has like an entry point.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.320
And then if you're reading left to right, it kind of determines how you're going to go through.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:20.020
He's done some thinking about tables as sort of architectures, I think, but I haven't, I haven't gone too deep, into it.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.940
Me neither, but I guess that informs like things like sorting that we saw under the other tables.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:35.900
Like there's a dominant sort, the most important things are at the top, maybe least important, but there's, there's definitely some sort of like, you know, like conscious sorting and like, it's obvious what it is.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.020
And it's just to serve a purpose.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.380
Yeah.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:40.380
Yeah.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:40.420
Yeah.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:45.840
There's probably an, an art to finding the thing that attracts your attention first.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:56.860
And so then as you progress through looking at it, you can do so in a deterministic purposeful way, rather than just, you know, you land anywhere and you start looking around visually.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:58.700
Yeah.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:58.760
Yeah.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.080
Yeah.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:20:59.180
Yeah.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:20:59.480
Yeah.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:04.560
It's wild because like, it is such a, such a creative act making a table.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.880
It seems weird to say it.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.780
It's not just results.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.840
You just slap down.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:17.080
You have to envision yourself in the, the viewer's shoes and like how to, how they would ingest or like digest information in the most easiest manner possible.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:26.300
Like with all sorts of like little affordances, like the way you format things, space in between columns, all sorts of wild little tiny details.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:32.240
They all like combine to like make something really good or to make the table shine, I guess you can say.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:32.960
Yeah.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.880
Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.180
I want to come back to this one about the, the listening.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.720
Um, and I'll, I'll link to all these in the show notes, of course.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.240
Yeah.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:50.340
Here we've got the average stream duration and it's represented by the little bars in the table itself, which we've already talked about, which is awesome.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:55.340
And the values are things like 87%, 80%, 84%, whatever.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.340
That little section is fraught with possible misrepresentation.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:23.340
So if that was just a number and it was average seconds, well, if you listen to say the Scorpions or some of the older rock bands or Iron Maiden, I don't know where they have songs that are like seven or eight minutes long versus more modern songs that are maybe two and a half minutes long.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.680
And it said, Hey, look, I only listened to these like two and a half minutes, but I listened to the Scorpions for three minutes.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.740
That must be the winner, right?

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.480
Like, no, you're not even listening close to the same amount.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.840
So putting numbers even there, even before you would normalize them, right?

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:43.220
Just put them as a percent of, of that, that as like the total average of the song or something.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.720
There's a lot to think about with these things.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.200
And that can kind of go away with these graphs, right?

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.260
You don't have to worry about that.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.680
You're like, Oh, you don't have to worry about how long is their average song.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.380
You can see, you know, just how long did I listen to their stuff?

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.800
That's kind of cool.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.520
Yeah.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.200
It's really cool.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.760
And it's a great use of space too, right?

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.960
Like horizontal bar plot.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.580
I mean, these are like rows, which are not that high, but you still fit a plot in.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.500
We don't have that many choices, but, horizontal.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:11.740
Yeah.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.440
They can be just a couple of pixels high and you can still see, see that kind of information

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.740
super well, as long as you use enough color or whatever.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.600
All right.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.300
Well, let's talk about great tables.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:29.740
So I feel like we probably have set the stage well enough for, for people to go, okay,

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:35.600
maybe there's, maybe there's something here rather than just, you know, header rows and columns.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.200
So tell us about great tables.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.720
When did it come into existence?

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.440
Why do you guys build it?

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:42.980
What is it?

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.480
Yeah, Rich, you want to hit it?

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.080
Yeah, sure.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.580
So, actually started from an R program or package a long time ago, back in 2018.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:56.960
Um, and like, there was like, essentially like a list of projects that were sort of like,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:02.620
I'm not being handled at our, at then our studio now posit and a tables was there.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.420
It was like, Oh, this seems like such an obvious one.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.540
I will take that.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.580
I will work on that.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.860
And I have an interest in that.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.160
I'm going to do it.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.180
Nobody else did it.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.380
It was on that list for years.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.800
And it kind of begs the question like why?

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:19.080
Cause tables are such omnipresent, you know, way of presenting data.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.840
I see it like in, I don't know, like journal articles, like half the things are tables,

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.880
half things are plots.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.720
Um, and they're, you know, everywhere else.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.520
So like, yeah, there should be this thing.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.900
So I decided to just get going on that.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:39.820
And, as, as Michael said, like, it's a lot of code and like, I didn't envision it would take that much code.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.120
I thought it'd be rather simple working with HTML table.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:50.020
And then, you know, expanding towards other types of like table outputs, like a PDF, you know, word and stuff like that.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.120
Uh, but I thought, you know, those would be bite-sized little things.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.820
As it turns out, tables run pretty deep.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:01.900
Um, and I really only found that out when looking at, I was doing some like literature review.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.580
And I found that 1949 census manual.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.000
It's like the review of tabular, presentation.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.480
Yeah.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.240
It's a great PDF that lives on the internet.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.060
It's always there.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.580
Thanks.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:13.980
Whoever.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.840
What year is this from?

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.600
1949.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.600
And it is, it's, it's like a janky.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.800
Yeah.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.760
Scanned in thing.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:28.160
They don't even align, but it's, you know, this is like hundreds of pages of table stuff.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.880
It's both the style guide for the census at the time, and also just like an amazing.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.440
Like reference for anything tables and even just presenting data.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.720
Like they, they go so deep on the smallest little things.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.920
It's incredible.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.380
Yeah.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.260
They sketch things out.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.220
They give things names.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:51.260
That was super important because otherwise you'd just be saying that area on the top left, whatever that is.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:51.520
Yeah.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.380
It's good to have.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.260
Almost like design patterns for that.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:55.500
Right.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:55.740
Yes.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.060
Yeah.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:56.380
Yeah.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.260
This is what was needed.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.760
it, and I'm pretty thankful I found this otherwise we'd have to make it up, but this seems like.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.760
As close to a standard as we'll ever find on this sort of thing on making tables.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.780
Right.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:13.860
So in 1942, we have the formal table and its major parts continued, you know, amazing.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.700
Yeah.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.880
And there's so much good text.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.660
Like it's expertly written.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:24.960
Um, this stuff, I mean, of course these are tables in print and of course we have the web.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:30.460
So that changes things a little bit, but you'd be kind of surprised how, how, you know, still relevant.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.460
These recommendations are.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:31.460
Yeah.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.460
They teach you to be economical with how much data you put on.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.780
How much, basically the tough thing, how much ink are you going to like spend on a visualization?

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.620
And, it just carries it through to all the different parts, which is, you know, amazing.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.280
And we took a lot of that and applied to here as best as we could.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.520
Um, you know, with some more modern things as well, but.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.620
Yeah, of course.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:57.640
Um, but it's yeah, very much a very useful reference, like the foundational reference for this.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:04.240
So right on the great tables page, you've got the components of a table.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:04.900
Yeah.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.040
You don't want to give us a sense of what's beyond header rows and columns.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:09.600
Yeah.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.460
Michael, would you?

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:10.920
Sure.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.420
Yeah.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:11.740
Yeah.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.600
I think so.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:26.000
I mean, I think even just the very first thing at the top, this table header with a title and a subtitle, that's like that, that seems like a really simple thing, but I think that it's easy to overlook.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.240
Um, like a lot of people think of a table is just the like data and maybe some labels.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:51.600
But if you think about like the information hierarchy and someone who has maybe 10 seconds, five seconds to figure out what's going on, as it turns out, the title is probably the most, one of the most important parts because it tells them in two seconds, what should I expect from this thing?

00:27:51.600 --> 00:28:01.900
So like, if you send to your boss, a table, if you had to do one thing, you should probably put a title on it so that they know what you're sending to them.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.460
And I think, so that's like, maybe a silly thing.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:18.140
Maybe it feels like table stakes, but I think like the title and the subtitle are small elements that really kind of, if you're thinking of a table as communication, you, you wouldn't write an article without a title.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:24.300
Um, so this really is just, probably wouldn't put a graph up without a title.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.040
Right.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.980
Right.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:30.840
So it's kind of bringing tables up to the standard of other communications.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.960
Yeah.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:48.960
And then I think, the other thing I really like is these are really simple elements, but these footnotes on the bottom and source notes, this idea that if you just create a spot for your like references, it's a lot easier to get.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.140
Get into the habit of, of referencing where things came from.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:59.920
So like we have some table examples in our gallery and they, in their footnotes, they often say where, we got them from.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:15.120
And it's just so, so helpful having that like hook that you can hang into to quickly, like as a quick reminder that if you, like, if you make it easy to put your references in footnotes, you know, you just can make a habit of it.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.240
So those are kind of funny.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:25.020
Those are like the bookends of a table, but I, I really appreciate that they're there to emphasize how critical they are.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.900
If tables are a form of, communication.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:28.700
Yeah.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:41.380
The one that stood out to me and I called out at the first table we talked about was the spanner label that kind of says these three columns are kind of in some category together.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.340
Yeah.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:44.380
The hierarchy is pretty important.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:51.120
It lets you sort of like, oh yeah, I care about this package of, or this set of columns, or maybe I don't, maybe I care about these ones over here.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:56.600
You just quickly get oriented to like the columns that, you know, are more useful.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.500
And also it allows you to do that thing that Michael mentioned before.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:05.880
You don't have to like have tons of like label on the below columns, like on one label or tons of text on one label.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:10.640
You can split it up between like spanner and then like the things that it's associated to, you know, the columns.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.820
So you might have things like, some type of measure and then like the units for the column labels, for instance.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.180
Yeah.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:25.020
In our basketball example, it could be distance from visiting arena that it could just have average or miles from visiting arena and then just average and median.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.840
And that's all it has to say, but you wouldn't have average and median.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:36.160
That's called them like, unless it was really, really clear, but in a complicated thing, it wouldn't make sense to just have those two words like average or what, you know?

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:36.780
Yeah.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:42.580
As part of that visualization, thoughtful design is about, allows you to be creative and also thoughtful for the user.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.660
Yeah.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.660
Or the reader, I should say.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.360
I think it helps too, cause a lot of tables I've seen go big on columns.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.080
There's like quite a few, there can be tons of columns.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:31:02.060
And so I think when you have like, let's say you have a dozen columns, if you have like two or three spanners over them, it feels easier.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.920
It feels like closer to a table with three columns in a sense.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.100
It started, you kind of know what you're getting into.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.740
So you can kind of ease into it.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:11.660
Yeah.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:16.360
You kind of zoom in by picking a spanner and then paying attention to those pieces or something.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.100
Yeah.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.000
Yeah, totally.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:28.620
And as well, having these tools at your disposal as well, also kind of like lets you be, like I said, creative, but also it gives you options to explore different ways of creating a table.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.240
Yeah.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:36.220
If you didn't have like the ability to put a spanner, say in this program, this Python library, you'd have to think of other ways.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.820
You'd have to, it basically changes your whole presentation, not having options to do so.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.060
Right.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:49.740
You'd want to try to leverage color maybe to try to infer their group somehow, but then, yeah, so it's incomplete.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.580
Yeah.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:50.900
For sure.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:51.920
Yeah.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:32:01.420
So Anon out in the audience asks, like, there's a lot, R has lots of great examples, but I've struggled since it's not equivalent in Python.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.160
Let me suggest your tip.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:09.260
I kind of feel like, like great tables is the entry point for a lot of that.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:09.500
Right.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.080
What do you think?

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:10.480
Yeah.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.460
I think too, maybe something rich you can hit on is there's a lot to appreciate from the history of R.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:28.880
Like it's really surprising to people how hard people have gone on tables in R and some of everything leading up to Rich working on GT and R, tables in R in 2018.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:38.980
There's actually like a 20 year history leading into that, that maybe Rich, you can talk a bit about to kind of set this up for what audiences.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.040
So let me just add before you guys just jump in real quick.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.060
You guys both are, we didn't catch this in the introduction bits.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:55.740
You're both working at Posit, the company that created Shiny, was an absolute leader in R and now has Shiny for Python and all those kinds of things.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.640
So just add in some background history for everyone.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.180
Okay, go ahead.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:00.740
Yeah.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:06.780
So basically R goes back probably about as far as Python, 90s or so.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.700
But R seemed to have a head start on tables.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:16.460
I mean, as far back as 2000, they had a LaTeX sort of table generating package.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:25.460
And then in the intervening years, the decades since up to now, they've had upwards of eight to 10 table packages.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.700
I think had to do with the fact that data frames are just like, you know, as part of the language.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.460
So it just made sense to make a table.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:40.140
And also they just had, I guess, a lot of tooling for creating PDFs, especially for like package like references.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.280
So basically R has tons of like examples, vignettes and things like that.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.380
Maybe not so much on the Python side.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.940
We're trying to get that in.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:53.140
Although I've been maximal on the table examples for the R version of this, which is called GT.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.920
Haven't quite got there yet on the Python side.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.320
So if you're seeing less examples, then you might see on the R side.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.040
Make sure that they are coming soon.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.140
Still working on it.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:07.520
Yeah.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:19.680
So let's talk about, let's talk about the Python side about what is my data journey to get something into great tables and then maybe what comes out of great tables.

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:24.000
So it starts with, sounds like data frame libraries.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.860
Okay.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:26.780
What ones are supported?

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.540
How's that work?

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.780
What's the most ideal one?

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.760
Yeah.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:35.340
So we, we support out of the gate pandas and polars.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:47.980
And we have, we've made this into lean pretty hard on polars in our examples, just because it has some kind of special moves that work really well with great tables.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.600
So for example, selectors and stuff, right?

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.320
Yeah.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:51.980
Selectors.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.280
So that really was eyeopening to us.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:35:00.360
And I think the polars team a little bit, I think they hadn't, I think great tables was one of the first packages that.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:05.820
Went really hard and integrating with polar selectors as part of our API.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:16.060
So there are like, if you want to set a spanner label, so you want to set a label over some columns, you can use polar selectors to do that in great tables.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.860
And that's a really nice, that's, that's what we do all the time.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:20.860
And it's really convenient.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:31.080
I think that that was kind of an early use of an external package for the polar team using their selectors and stuff.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:36.820
So we, we had a lot of communication with them about it early on.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.700
But I would say, so it takes a pandas or a polar's data frame.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:46.700
And we've leaned pretty hard into polar's just because of some of these really nice affordances.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.040
Yeah.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:53.940
If you go to the get started guide, you'll see it inside of selecting table parts and then like selecting columns.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:58.260
I believe we have this little sidebar, which sections up the getting started.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.180
Oh boy.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:00.720
Yeah.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:00.940
Okay.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:01.660
Getting started.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:05.200
Oh, if you go to the very bottom on the sidebar.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.080
So scroll down.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:07.340
Gotcha.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:07.800
Yeah.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.020
That column selection.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:09.900
Column selection.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.300
So sorry.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:11.860
There we go.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.480
Yeah.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:12.780
Yeah.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.240
Words.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.760
There's a whole using polar selectors section.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.080
Yeah.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:18.580
Here we go.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.020
Here we go.

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:19.640
Yeah.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.020
Yeah.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:32.960
So that's just an example of dropping polar selectors into the great table method to move certain columns to the beginning of the table.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.700
Yeah.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.580
Or you might do another example where you choose a number of columns to put a spanner over top of.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:38.940
Right.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.200
And they might be named in a systematic way, which is like the advantage here.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.280
Mm-hmm.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.940
And you can do it for pandas as well.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:46.880
Just not with selectors.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.240
You just use lambdas and such to have similar functionality.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.180
Interesting.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:51.720
Okay.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.720
Yeah.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.000
So yeah, pandas are polar.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.800
Polars has some really nice benefits like selectors.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:04.480
And then it also, it's used quite a bit whenever we style a table.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:10.760
We often use polar expressions to kind of target the areas to style.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:18.320
So if you want to choose like for this column, make the maximum value of the column yellow.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:31.760
It's really easy with polar expressions to say, you know, when this column is equal to the max value in itself.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:32.800
I see.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.040
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:41.120
Because then you don't have to figure out what the max is and then try to come up with a gradient range of it.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.780
You just put it into little bins or whatever.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:46.040
Yeah.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:46.960
Yeah, exactly.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:56.620
One thing I just noticed that's pretty sweet about this actually is you already talked about the sources and the references and things like that.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.400
Yeah.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.700
But I just noticed that you have markdown support for your references.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:09.600
Yeah, that's a good one because like sometimes you want to bold italicize things, maybe make a list within your footer, your source notes.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.640
Yeah, sure.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:17.600
I mean, even in the official way you're supposed to reference things, there's stuff that's supposed to be italicized and stuff that's not right.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.280
Exactly.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.280
Markdown.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:19.280
Yeah.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:24.720
So you want these tables to be useful for like a wide range of people.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.320
And if they didn't have that, I don't know what they would do.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.160
They'd just use HTML, I guess, and try their best with tags.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:34.080
But this is just an easy, obvious way to make it simple.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.620
Yeah, that's really great.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.100
So we start with some data.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.120
We load it ideally into polars, it sounds like, but Pandas is also supported.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:53.700
And then you kind of visually, I say visually, the indentation of the way the code looks somewhat represents the structure of the table.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:58.640
A little Flutter or HTML-esque in that sense.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.760
Yeah.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.400
Yeah, totally.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:09.140
I think we think a lot of it about in terms of three main activities, structure, format, and style.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:13.600
And we've tried to make the method names match up a bit.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.280
So everything starting with tab is basically about structuring the table.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.260
So that's those big pieces in the diagram we looked at.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:29.200
Whether it's setting the title with tab title or tab header or setting footnotes.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.020
Those are all structure activities.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.320
So they all start with tab.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.840
And then there's this just incredible bucket of formatters.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.140
Rich really went ham on formatting methods.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.460
So it's everything starting with FMT.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:52.220
This is like, yeah, this is like maybe you want to format the number of decimal places.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:58.360
But Rich has gone even further to like, maybe you want to put like a country flag in your table.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.100
Rich has got you.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.200
He wanted it to be easy to put country flags.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.220
And I'm here for it.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.120
Yeah.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:13.800
So those little graphical elements are amazing for quickly conveying information.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.460
Kind of like the logo of the various universities that you would see on SportsCenter or whatever.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.220
You're like, yeah, that's what I'm used to looking at.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:20.860
Yeah.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:21.240
That's right.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.540
You just use format image for that.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.840
And you just, yeah, give it an image on disk or wherever.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.760
And it gets in there.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:28.580
Yeah.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.160
And I was kind of confused why I was adding so many formatters at first.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:46.560
But I feel like the thing that really clicked for me is that if you think about, so if you go, actually, if you go up to the very top and then into the reference on the top bar, that will have lots of formatters.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.540
Yeah.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.560
They're just listed out.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:41:03.080
So what clicked for me is that spreadsheet users, so people in Excel making a table, are really used to tons of convenient things like formatting dates.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.040
Right.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:11.920
You highlight a column, you press currency, then you press the move, the decimal point, two points in the left, they drop the portion, the portion ones and all that.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.080
Yeah.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:12.680
Yeah.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:19.920
So there is a world, like the engineer in me thought, like, ooh, I kind of wish this wasn't our job to do all this formatting.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:36.060
But I think Rich very intuitively picked up on, like, well, if people use Excel for tables, I think you have to give them a compelling reason to be able to do it all in Python, or they're not going to really want to make the jump.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:45.360
And so I think having all these formatters is just a way of bringing that kind of nuts aspect of Excel into great tables.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:45.760
Yeah.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.020
And some of this stuff is tough, like, and fiddly, if you do it yourself.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:52.820
Like, I'm not just talking about simple, like, format, like, strings.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:53.220
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:53.540
I'm talking about.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:58.000
Can I do, like, a colon and then a comma and then a .2 and we're done?

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.220
Yeah.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.080
First you gotta do that.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.120
And then, like, there might be some other weird things.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:07.340
So we try to, like, make it super simple with just some simple options, some arguments, and you're pretty much there.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.200
Yeah.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.300
One thing I'll maybe give a shout out.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:25.900
I know you talked about it, PyCon, was if you've got a bunch of numbers, like, let's say it's currency, you might want to format that using, like, if it's over a million, 1.2M.

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:31.980
But if it's only 120,000, you might want to say 120K.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.660
Yeah.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.580
Right?

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.580
Something where it's, yeah.

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.380
Where it uses sort of an abbreviator.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.020
Yeah.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.440
It's also useful if you have, like, tons and tons of numbers, like a wall of numbers.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.540
You're running out of space, so you just need to compactly.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.880
And, like, the small figures don't really mean much.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.100
Like, you just want broad strokes.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.900
Like, it just can be the compact thing.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.800
It's great.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.460
And it works really well for, like, things where you don't need to have that much precision.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.360
So you still need to be able to.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.480
Yeah.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:07.280
You also seem to have taken a pragmatic approach where it's not like, well, you're not, we're not going to let you mix units in a column.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:07.940
Right?

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:11.820
If it's not, you know, kilometers and meters.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.740
It's all kilometers, it's all meters.

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.000
Take it or leave it, you know?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.740
Yeah.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.620
Yeah.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:17.800
I think.

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.740
Freedom, baby.

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.260
That's what you want.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.180
You can, like, you can target.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.040
So we have, like, a column targeting system.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.200
But you can also, like, sort of, like, subset, like, what rows you want.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.280
So that's the way.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:35.300
So basically, you can, like, format different ways down the column if you so choose to, which makes it more flexible.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.560
Yeah, I think it goes back, too, to Excel.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.240
And, you know, Excel's just a big lump of clay.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.160
You can just carve out your table however you want.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.340
And it does, like, do formatting, but it doesn't prescribe.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:53.660
Yeah, like you said, it doesn't constrain you to have to, like, do it for a whole column.

00:43:53.660 --> 00:44:01.580
And I think that's, like, we're endlessly surprised by the types of tables people create and the things they communicate.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:08.060
And in a way, it's, like, leaving room for surprise that people are so creative.

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:20.180
You want some constraints, but you kind of also want to let them surprise you with things you wouldn't think of but that end up being really useful.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:29.320
And I don't doubt someone's there, like, mixing all kinds of things in ways I wouldn't imagine but end up kind of working out.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.780
I think it was, like, in our table contests where I was, like, first surprised.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:38.580
Basically, we throw together table contests at Posit.

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.680
It's such a nerdy thing.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.320
But, like, people submit tables and they get judged on them.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.720
Like, they get prizes.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.640
Everyone's a winner.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.980
Rich is a very kind judge, to be sure.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:52.060
It's, like, everybody wins in Rich's house.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:52.580
Yeah.

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.360
But they're so good.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.200
Like, I see these tables.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.800
I'm like, I never even thought of that.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.780
Like, that could be done.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.800
You'd want to do that.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.100
And I actually like it.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:00.760
Like, yeah.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.760
It's actually inspiring every time.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:10.480
It's got to be pretty hard to build a framework around such visual flexibility, you know?

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.640
Yeah.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.880
But still have something prescriptive, right?

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.220
Yeah.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:21.720
I guess the trick is just, like, have easy conveniences just to do broad swaths of formatting and styling.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:27.160
But also make it granular and give people power, I guess you could say, along with simplicity.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:28.260
Yeah.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:35.100
So tell people about these contests if somebody wants to try their hand at great tables and submitting something, you know?

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.620
I think we're even in the advent of code time.

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:41.380
And I guess we just had the hour of code stuff.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.100
But there's a lot of these things where people are trying.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:47.080
I just need some examples to play with to try to learn a thing, right?

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:47.760
Yeah.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.400
So we do it in the summer, so not wintertime, which is actually good for submissions.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:51.600
Good.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.360
So it's still coming up.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:52.600
Yeah.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.120
Yeah.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.920
And we give a generous amount of time.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.700
I think, like, two or three months, if I remember correctly.

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.020
But, yeah, we just made the call.

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:01.680
It's like, submit your table.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.700
We have a nice form.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.620
And people submit them.

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:08.840
And we sometimes get up to 50, sometimes 80 entries.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.160
It's like, we get quite a few.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:19.600
And then we do the tough job of, you know, having a number of judges and just, you know, multiple judge grading of the tables.

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:23.400
And we had so many that we had to split them up into categories, right?

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.620
Because we were going to celebrate all these different types of tables.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:31.760
And different domains of, you know, have typically different types of tables.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.820
And so it just makes sense to break it up in that way.

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.440
Yeah.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:42.400
And I do, if I had to give advice, it's like much more free form than a lot of the advent of code.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:49.900
There's no, because there's no target or even necessarily starting point, it could be really hard for some people, I think,

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.260
to get started or figure out, like, what could I do with this?

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:59.760
But I think if I had to give any advice, I think looking through the past entries is so helpful.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.800
Like scanning past entries and even choosing some that inspire you.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:10.740
And then whether it's, whether you take data similar to those and maybe try to do something related,

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:21.500
or go in like a similar direction and look for new data, I think the existing entries are really, really inspiring.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.620
If I had to...

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.280
Get the creative juices flowing, right?

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.500
Like, oh, I didn't even think you could go down that direction.

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.100
Let's try that with my data.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:28.800
Yeah.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:28.840
Yeah.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:36.840
Because I think if you start with just a blank page and you're kind of new even to great tables, it can be hard to know where to go.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:42.420
But once you start looking at entries, I think you get a feel for all the kinds of things you can do with it.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.560
Oh, that sounds great.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:51.080
How important is it that you have interesting data to start with?

00:47:51.080 --> 00:48:01.000
Like, hey, let's grab the data that they use to image the first black hole and try to make a cool picture out of, you know, table picture out of that.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.920
That's a great question.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:09.800
I think it really hits on one of the neat things about these contests is that you don't have to have interesting data at all.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:14.080
Actually, one category of entry is kind of zany.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:21.340
It's like recreating something that exists in, say, like, great tables or some other library.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:26.380
Like, Rich and I were talking recently about GitHub issues.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:35.120
So, like, GitHub issues are a really interesting example of a table because they're a table that software developers work with nonstop.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:39.960
Like, I'm all in those tables all day.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:46.140
And it's like an interesting entry would just be to recreate that.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:55.380
Like, if you recreated GitHub issues in a table and it looked really spot on, that's like its own kind of special accomplishment.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:05.320
Like, and I think those entries are fun to see, like, someone recreate an existing thing in great tables or something else.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:17.040
So that, so, yeah, to your point on data, I think you could start with even not having to find interesting data, but find an interesting table out in the wild and just try to recreate it.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.040
Yeah.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:19.400
Yeah.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:29.100
So I don't know if this has anything to do with your contest or not, but let me suggest an interesting angle to this in terms of, like, competitions for this or just broadly for people who are listening.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.060
One is I've got really interesting data.

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.320
I have a story to tell.

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.980
And let me try to, like, really inspire you with my custom story.

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:44.340
You know, if you look at racing, like, specifically auto racing, we've got F1 where everyone designs their own car.

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:48.800
There are some rules, but they kind of, they all have 1,000 or 500 people that work on it.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:55.060
Then you've got spec racing series, like Indy, where everyone has the same car, the same engine, or there's two choices, whatever.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.220
Same thing.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:57.240
And then they compete.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.500
So it would be interesting to have a category that is like, this is the data.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.340
You have to work with this, but tell a story.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.820
Like, who could tell the story the most interesting with, like, the same data?

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:11.120
Which ends a little bit Kaggle-like, I suppose.

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.200
Yeah.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.580
Or Tidy.

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.880
Have you seen Tidy Tuesday?

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.640
Tidy Tuesday?

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.960
Yeah, Tidy Tuesday.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.720
I think it's exactly what you're describing.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.460
Every Tuesday they release a dataset.

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:22.180
Yeah.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.000
And then people.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.680
Oh, wow.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.280
It's very.

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:31.560
There's a GitHub repo somewhere where they.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.580
Yeah.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.020
If you search for Tidy Tuesday at GitHub, you'll definitely find it.

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:37.320
But essentially, yeah, it's just like data.

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.360
And you're.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.900
You left your own devices about how to present it.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.820
It could be tables, plots, anything.

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:44.760
Yeah.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.620
I'm surprised the big Tidy Tuesdays.

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:48.180
It's kind of a tricky one.

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.200
There's a.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.540
I think there's a Tidy Tuesday organization.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:52.200
But.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.180
Yeah.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:54.740
Same data.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:55.380
And yeah.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.400
People analyze it.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.580
And then they share it out on socials.

00:50:58.580 --> 00:50:59.080
Yeah.

00:50:59.180 --> 00:50:59.920
So you get to.

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.060
I think exactly to your point.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.500
Like you start from the same place and you see where people.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.900
Get to.

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:05.300
And.

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:09.160
I know like one our user, Dave Robinson, for a long time.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:13.300
Would screencast himself live analyzing for an hour.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:14.480
Oh, wow.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:14.860
Okay.

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:18.340
Like what does it look like for someone to analyze the data?

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:22.420
And I think that's a fun dimension, too, that you don't see often.

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:25.060
Like just how does it unfold?

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:25.400
Like.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.400
Right.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.080
What point does he plot and when does he go backwards?

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.460
It's like the Bob Ross of.

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:37.420
Of tales, you know, like the happy little trees come first and then this and that.

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:38.600
Oh, that's how you make that picture.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:38.940
Okay.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:39.560
Right.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.360
Yeah.

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:40.680
Yeah.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.080
I mean, like just yesterday I was making new examples.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.820
I'm not surprised how long it takes to make a compelling example for a table.

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:48.800
It's like.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.140
Yeah.

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:51.160
You have to mess with the data.

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.780
Yeah.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:52.920
Yeah.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:58.080
And I will say this coffee table example that Marco pointed out.

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:08.920
So the coffee table example for people listening is a it's an example table we created where every row is a like coffee device.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:16.320
So it's the idea of this table is for like a fictional coffee device shop and every row is a coffee device.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.700
And then there are columns on like, oh, how many did we sell?

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.820
How much profit did we make?

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:30.840
And then there's a nice little there's a column that's little bar charts that show the monthly sales broken down.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:34.120
And I'm trying to hover over one of those bars.

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:34.760
Yeah.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.060
Yeah.

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:35.200
Yeah.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.000
Bars.

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:37.060
Yeah.

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:44.460
So this is one of the things I wanted to make sure that we got a chance to talk about, because this is we've talked about having images in here, which is great.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:48.140
And the what is this thing called?

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:50.100
That this group spanner.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.200
I can only think splitter.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:51.840
I'm like, no, it's not.

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:52.680
It's great.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.720
The spanners and the colors and stuff there.

00:52:56.220 --> 00:53:01.100
But then you have what in the framework is referred to as nano plots.

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:01.980
Yeah.

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:02.380
Right.

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.380
So that we already saw the bar graph, but that was just an example.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.660
But here we've got like a little bar chart.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:13.640
And Rich, as you point out, as I interact with it, it's like a little plotly type thing.

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:19.800
Like, if I had, if I were real young and my eyes were real good, I could read the labels.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:23.380
They're very small, but you have very low space.

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:23.800
So like.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.240
I mean, they're nano size.

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.180
That's why they're called that.

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.960
They're not even micro plots.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:28.800
They're just nano plots.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.740
Exactly.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.540
A few instruments.

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:31.420
That's all we got here.

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:31.800
Let's go.

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:40.420
They're meant for HTML and meant to be lightweight, slightly interactive, just to give you a little something, you know, to mouse over and to drill down.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:45.200
They're massively important because it shows you it's.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:53.560
I had Stephanie, Stephanie Molin on a little while ago, and she has this project that sort of.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:54:03.900
If you want the same information about the statistical summary of some set of data, like the standard distribution, the mean, the max, the min.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.740
And it could be like one little blob or she has this thing.

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.160
I'll animate it into like a kangaroo or something.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.160
And it's got all the same information.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.260
You have the same problem with tables here, right?

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.940
Like the total amount sold, the percent sold.

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:23.220
But if you look at the nano plots, some of them are really spotty and some of them are pretty much flat.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:23.960
Yeah.

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:28.560
That it tells you a whole nother dimension that's kind of, this is kind of what I was getting at.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:35.840
Like you could make this multidimensional and that's another piece of communication that isn't just, you know, rows and columns.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.200
Yeah.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.980
It's a nice connotation too, because each of those bars could very well be a column, right?

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.520
You can have like a January column.

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.940
Yeah, exactly.

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:43.720
Yeah.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.220
So it just shrinks it down.

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.520
And it's useful.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.960
So instead of having a table and a plot, then you've got to like jump back and forth.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:53.060
Like it emerges these two ideas in a pretty cool way.

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:53.360
Yeah.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.840
Sort of like split the difference between tables and plots.

00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:05.780
I like too that with the nano plots, like these little bar charts, maybe their job, like in a lot of tables, their job is to focus you onto a row.

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:11.180
Like if you notice that pattern's interesting, it pulls you onto that record, that row.

00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:24.020
And then that lets you visit other columns to see like supplemental information that maybe suggests what could be happening or like gives you information to look up more as you're doing an analysis.

00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:31.460
So it's kind of a neat like visual pattern as a way to index onto interesting cases.

00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:37.940
And then columns have the power to give you more information about these places.

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.120
Yeah, that's cool.

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:49.740
It seems like because you can put markdown into these pieces as well, you could have them maybe jump to the full size plot or something more rich as you want to kind of expand a row or something.

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:51.140
Yeah, totally.

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:55.540
I think there are interactive table libraries too.

00:55:55.540 --> 00:56:00.180
So one we have ported to Python recently is called Reactable.

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:06.080
So we made a port called ReactablePy that it offers expanding tables.

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:17.080
So if you're interested in a row, you can click it to expand down, say like more information or even a lot of like detail and description.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:28.860
But I think to your point, yeah, that's a really neat possibility of being able to like click and either be taken somewhere or have the table like open up.

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:32.780
And yeah, that would be cool to have an inline capability.

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.280
Yeah, I do.

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:40.400
I don't want to know one thing about this table that I think about a lot is we I'm so glad that Marco brought up.

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.740
I think that's a lot of people who are using this table.

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:42.740
I think that's a lot of people who are using this table.

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:43.740
I think that's a lot of people who are using this table.

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:44.740
I think that's a lot of people who are using this table.

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:45.740
I think that's a lot of people who are using this table.

00:56:45.740 --> 00:57:02.760
creating this table and I talk about this with open source developers sometimes that I think about this, like how long we spent on this table, because this table's job was to illustrate like structuring, formatting and styling.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:18.440
And like what what should be like your first encounter with great tables and so we really, in a sense, as we created this table, we are on the hunt for a table that both introduced people to a range of activities.

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:24.780
like looked nice, like looked nice, but also had code that we could explain.

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:33.080
And I it's like so hard, I feel like as open source maintainers sometimes to find that like right example, like.

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:40.080
Compelling shows off like a range of activities, but also is approachable.

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:50.340
And I do remember like Marco, one thing that opened my eyes is he, I think he shared this table on LinkedIn once, but he shortened it to like three or four rows.

00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:57.260
And that I'm always really interested in seeing those types of activities, because I think that post really took off.

00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:07.380
And it, I don't know, it always like, teaches me the, the power and the value of really like, getting an example down.

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:11.880
And getting it so it's interesting, but also like short and compact.

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:12.860
Yeah.

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:16.200
It's like such a art that some people are so good at.

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.680
Yeah, it's very cool.

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:20.820
We don't have much time left.

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:29.860
So I want to focus on the last bit of this journey that data goes through with great tables and that is what happens?

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.880
Where does it go at the end?

00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:35.300
You know, like what can I export?

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.020
Yeah.

00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:44.120
So we talked about HTML and this interactive bit, but what are the different places that you could send this to?

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.160
Well, I think the big ones are notebook.

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:50.020
You're just iterating through some data and you want a table.

00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:51.320
Maybe you want to present that as well.

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.360
So a notebook is a really good example.

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:58.860
So maybe you put that actually just in a cell and just as part of the notebook, it just runs there.

00:58:58.860 --> 00:58:59.060
Yeah.

00:58:59.060 --> 00:58:59.620
That's right.

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:00.000
That's right.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.280
And another one is just like, you want it somewhere else and maybe you want it in a presentation.

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.400
You want a graphic.

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:07.160
So we have a facility for that.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.080
It's the save method.

00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:11.980
We just like you to get a image file or even a PDF from the table.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:15.840
And sometimes you just want to take that HTML and run with it somewhere else.

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.100
Maybe embedded somewhere, maybe put it inside of an email.

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:26.140
So we have an as raw HTML method, which gives you an HTML string that you can just like pop in somewhere else.

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:26.320
Nice.

00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:35.920
And does that just give you like the worst possible HTML in the sense that like everything that has a color has a style set straight on it and stuff like that?

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.000
You have two different stages.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.620
You can have it like the style block, sort of like as a one div with the table and the style block embedded.

00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:47.780
Or you can have all the styles in line, which is a new feature, which is actually useful for emails.

00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.980
Yeah, exactly.

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:57.540
Because as much as you want to write nice stuff, we can't have nice things because a lot of the email clients forbid you from putting styles in there.

00:59:57.540 --> 00:59:59.060
Most notably Gmail.

00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.260
If you put a style, even a solid style block, it'll just throw it away.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.280
So you've got to just jam it onto everything.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:10.700
If that thing can be bold, it's in a span and it has, you know, style, font weight bold on it.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.000
You know?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.240
When I first learned of that like years ago, because I'm in the email game as well.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.600
I was like, really?

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.180
How does this exist in this year?

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.180
But it does.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.920
It still exists because of certain clients.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.520
So, yeah.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:30.260
But luckily there's lots of like great, and we have it here too, but there's lots of people who have developed libraries to inline CSS into tags.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.180
Yeah.

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:31.680
Yeah.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.840
That's my purpose.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.700
I guess one more output.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.040
Sorry.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:36.940
No, no, no.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:37.200
Go for it.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.880
It's a little attack, right?

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.300
Yeah.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.460
It's the final destination.

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.040
Yeah.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.120
That's a new thing.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.460
So if you're running a paper, you want a table in it.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.860
We now have some way to get the table.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:52.500
If you want your academic paper or your dissertation to have it, like, in it goes.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.340
Yeah.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.600
Sorry, Michael, what were you going to say?

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.240
Oh, no.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:04.080
I think one interesting thing too is I think Dot Show, we have a really great contributor, Ju Young, that prompted this.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:11.640
I think because he was teaching a workshop to vision impaired, like, data scientists.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:19.040
And so Dot Show is handy to be able to call Dot Show and have it open a browser with the table, I think was, like, really useful.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.120
I see.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.020
And that was so helpful to have as an issue.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:29.720
And I think that contribution to Great Table was really huge.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.560
Yeah, because then a screen reader could read it.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.740
Exactly.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.320
Yeah.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:35.680
Yeah.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.500
You have a facility for that.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:42.000
But also, it's kind of disappointing to work in the console and not have anything being shown.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.160
It's like, what?

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.040
Yeah.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.660
So that's really good.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:52.080
And I see Carol noted, Quarto, which is actually the whole Great Table's website is built with Quarto.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.560
And that's a nice format.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:02.060
So it uses a file called a QMD, which is a lot like Markdown, but it can run the code.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.220
And Quarto is really convenient for building things like websites or HTML reports.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.340
And it's also developed by Posit.

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:19.160
But we, yeah, we end up putting tables a lot in, like, Quarto documents or the, like, Great Table's website through Quarto.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:27.080
And maybe he's too bashful to mention it, but he developed, like, the library Quarto doc, which makes this site possible and makes those tables rendered.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.240
Oh, that's awesome.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.280
Oh, yeah.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:45.320
I guess for context, so, like, some tools like IBIS, their API docs and the Great Tables docs, yeah, we just created a small tool called Quarto doc to let them put their, like, API references in these websites so they can use Quarto.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.100
Yeah, that's excellent.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.300
Yeah, very, very cool.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:54.300
All right, well, I think we're pretty much out of time, I guess.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:03:01.180
Give people a sense of where you're going, like, roadmap type stuff.

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.960
Is there anything they should be looking out for?

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:09.320
Yeah, I think we want to port quite a bit more from the R program over to Great Tables.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:13.980
That includes things like merging, concatenating values from different columns into single columns.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:17.560
Things like adding footnotes to tables.

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.380
So the footer is more put to better use.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:24.460
And more refinements to formatters and additional formatters.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:26.340
There's quite a few more things to go.

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:29.620
But even right now, it's pretty mature.

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:34.100
But there's probably things people will ask for that I haven't thought of.

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:34.980
So that's...

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.520
I think Anon is asking for Excel.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.960
We'll put Excel in there, you know?

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:40.420
Yeah.

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.680
The snake will eat its own tail.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.000
Yeah.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.120
And then we'll put Great Tables in Excel.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.940
So you can just go all the way to the bottom, wherever that is.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:53.480
Well, I think one other thing to note is extensions.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:59.600
That in R, tons of people have extended GT, the Great Tables for R.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.380
And tons of helper packages.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:10.960
Like if putting a bar in your table is something you want to do, there are a lot of these inside extra helper packages.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:17.400
And so I think one nice thing would be we want to kind of create a like example helper package.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:23.440
Just to give a feel for how people in Python could also create this kind of stuff for Great Tables.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.440
If you want to extend like...

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:34.100
Yeah, if you wanted to create your own little bar charts in Great Tables, it seems like people have done a lot of that in R.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:39.540
And so it'd be cool to try to foster that kind of ecosystem and extension.

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:40.860
Absolutely.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.140
Yeah.

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.180
That's awesome.

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:44.560
All right.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.320
Well, I'm going to leave everybody with one parting thought.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.500
And then I'll let you guys give a final call to action.

01:04:52.620 --> 01:05:01.340
You're looking at some of these examples, especially those 10 ones that you called out, Rich, that I'll link in the show notes.

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:15.460
If you're doing a presentation to your company on your blog as a data scientist or just generally, it's so easy, I think, to just have the tables.

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:17.340
And then maybe somewhere you have a picture or something.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:22.020
But if you put something together like that, that will get people's attention straight away.

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:22.340
Right.

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:26.520
It's just really another level of production.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:30.080
And the fact that you do it with Python means it's reproducible.

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.660
You do it once and off it goes.

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:32.660
Like, that's pretty excellent.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:37.100
So if that sounds like something you all do, you should check out Great Tables.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:37.900
It looks pretty excellent.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.240
All right.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:43.180
Michael, give a final call to action.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.440
People wanting to get started with Great Tables.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.000
What do you tell them?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.620
You know what?

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.440
Is it Great Tables?

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.040
Probably on GitHub.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.960
You know, check out the examples.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.280
I think the examples are such a helpful way to get started.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.380
And then if you get any questions at all, we have a Discord.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:04.060
Or we love hearing from people in the issues.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.420
You know, we want to hear from you.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:05.880
Me at all.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.980
We consider it pretty, you know, pretty carefully.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:09.820
Not carefully.

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.060
Awesome.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.980
And then I think your point, like, style pays.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.340
Like, you just got to churn out those beautiful tables.

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.340
You know, there's no other choice.

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:20.620
That's right.

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:28.400
I think also once you set up one of them, if you kind of do similar types of tables, like,

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.240
you can reuse that code in a lot of ways.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.280
So unlike doing it in a design or something.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.600
All right, Rich.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.000
Final word.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.520
Final word.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.800
Contribute.

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:43.180
Like, if you want to, it's more of a call of action, just get into the site.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:45.000
Discuss things with us.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.380
Even if your idea is, like, way in left field, we'll probably consider it and maybe even do it.

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:54.460
That's how eager we are to please when it comes to tables.

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.360
Awesome.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.600
So PRs are accepted.

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.400
PRs.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:57.680
Anything.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.620
Issues, complaints, whatever.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.400
Beautiful.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.300
All right.

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.880
Thanks for coming on the show, guys.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.480
Yeah.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.140
Thanks so much.

01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:05.880
Yeah.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:06.700
Congrats on the project.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:07.140
See you later.

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:07.880
See you.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.320
it.
