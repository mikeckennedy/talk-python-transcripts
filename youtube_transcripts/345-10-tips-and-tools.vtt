00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
>> Jay, welcome back to Talk Python To Me.


00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.480
>> It is always a pleasure to join the show and hang out.


00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.300
>> Yeah, it's a pleasure to have you here.


00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.120
You help out with all sorts of things


00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.120
and it's been great to bounce ideas off of you.


00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.580
I've had you on the show a couple of times,


00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.320
literally two times so far, I believe.


00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.240
>> How many more before I get like


00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.520
that golden jacket like they do on SNL?


00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.360
>> You get the golden jacket after 10.


00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.320
It's just a really, it is a commitment to get the jacket.


00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.520
We've only-- - Wow.


00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.520
- Yeah, well, we'll pick up the cadence here


00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.920
and we'll get you the jacket.


00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.880
I mean, you're a third of the way there basically.


00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.120
- All right, all right, I got goals now.


00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.120
Before I retire from the Python community,


00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.800
I will have my golden jacket from Talk Python.


00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.640
- That's right, oh man, if you come on 10 times,


00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.520
you are getting a jacket.


00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.200
I'll figure out how to get one of those.


00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.400
- I'll demand one.


00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.800
- Awesome, well, thank you for being here.


00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.920
This episode is going to be something of a reversal, but not 100% reversal.


00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.680
I've got all these ideas about developer productivity.


00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.000
I've been bouncing around and I want to share them with the audience.


00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.760
And so we're going to kind of share those together, right?


00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.420
I'll present them because I, it's my idea.


00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.000
I want to, I don't want to force that recommendation coming out of anyone else.


00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.280
Not, not, or, you know, you in particular.


00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.640
So I'll present them and then we'll discuss them.


00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.880
Right.


00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.480
So you'll be both the guest and the sounding board.


00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.760
How's that sound?


00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.440
- I get to be the Simon Cowell to your performance.


00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.040
I love it.


00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.640
- Yeah, exactly.


00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.720
Well, hopefully you're in a good mood


00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.560
because Simon, he can be tough sometimes.


00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.400
We'll see how it goes.


00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.220
We'll see how it goes.


00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.060
- I've seen the talk.


00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.440
I think there's a lot of great points in there


00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.840
and some stuff that I immediately was like,


00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.040
oh, and then I heard you explain it.


00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.960
I go, actually, you know, that's not a bad idea.


00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.160
So.


00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.360
- Well, you let me know where you disagree


00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.080
because a lot of these things, one thing that works


00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.960
for one person is exactly the wrong thing for others.


00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.800
Now, before we jump into it though,


00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800
you've been on the show a couple of times.


00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.560
The most recent time we were on,


00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.120
we talked about little automation tools,


00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.280
which was super fun.


00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.280
We had you, we had Rusty, we had Kim Van Wick,


00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.340
and we had Rivers Cuomo, of all people,


00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.680
who did a fantastic job on the show.


00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.120
So that was really fun, and I feel like


00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.760
that's a really good lead-in to this conversation here.


00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.880
Before we get to it though, you know, just for people who don't know you, it has been


00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.880
a little while.


00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.880
When was that?


00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.880
That was back in July since you've been on the show.


00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.680
Tell people a little bit about yourself.


00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.680
Yeah.


00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680
So I'm Jay Miller.


00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.200
I'm a developer advocate for a company called Elastic.


00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.520
We do Elasticsearch.


00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.200
I also do podcasting and a lot of productivity automation.


00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.560
And you can usually find that stuff over either on relay.fm, where my podcast lives, or on


00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.920
YouTube where I'm often talking about different productivity tools around the macOS ecosystem


00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.000
or the iOS ecosystem, mostly Mac.


00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.880
And I guess the biggest difference there is I don't shy away from like the programming


00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.880
friendly stuff.


00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.800
I am the more that I can hack in,


00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.360
you know, shell scripting, Python scripts,


00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.840
even Swift from time to time, like, bring it on.


00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.160
I am here for it.


00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.000
And yeah, so you're not, you're not,


00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.040
you're going to see some software recommendations from me,


00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.600
but I often tell people like, let's use what we know,


00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.600
build what we can,


00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.440
and ultimately just make things that work for us.


00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.600
And it's kind of me, it's kind of what I do.


00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.680
- That's awesome.


00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.440
If it's got to be solved with if this than that, then let it be solved that way.


00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.940
Right.


00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.840
Absolutely.


00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.080
Yeah.


00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.040
You want to give a quick shout out to your podcast in particular conduit.


00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.980
Yes.


00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.960
That's kind of new, right?


00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.840
You also did the productivity podcasts before this and then transitioned over here.


00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.340
Right.


00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.140
Yeah.


00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.800
So before I did a show called productivity and tech, it was, you know, just a general


00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.160
productivity conversation with people around the tech, I guess, lowercase word


00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.020
tech ecosystem, just learning how they did things and how they were more productive.


00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.580
Somewhere along the lines, I found my co-host for my current show, Kathy Campbell. And we do a show


00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:23.540
on Relay.fm called Conduit, where we talk about productivity, but make it so that it fits no


00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.820
matter what tools you're using. We do like to make up our own different funny names for things,


00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.940
different techniques and tools and stuff. But ultimately, the idea is whether you like GTD,


00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.900
whether you like bullet journaling or whether you absolutely have to build to-do lists in


00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.700
Visual Studio Code, like whatever you're choosing to do, like hopefully we can provide some


00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.660
guidance on how to do it to the best of your abilities.


00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.180
Yeah, that's awesome. We all have different tools. I remember being in one high-level meeting with


00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.060
some executives and such and they said, for some reason my screen was being shared because I was


00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.060
demoing something I said, Michael, can you just go and take some notes on so I guess sure. So I fired up


00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.740
VS Code in markdown mode and just started taking notes. So I go, okay, I see how we're taking notes


00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.260
here. This is very like, I didn't know they expected like one note or something. I know what they wanted.


00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.900
But yeah, like, no, this is how we do it. We're doing this.


00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.020
Yeah, I mean, you'll often hear me talk. I'm a notebook pen and paper person. So


00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.460
when it comes to managing projects or tasks, I'm often starting in my notebooks, and then I'll move


00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.260
it over to a digital format, like if I need to share it out or something like that.


00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.780
Yeah, right on. Also, from the audience, Jaylee says, "Please make that golden jacket a thing."


00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.340
Goals. Yeah, we got goals. I think so. It's easy


00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.500
for me to stand behind this because I'm pretty sure we don't have any 10-time repeat guests.


00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.580
I've put the bar pretty high, but we'll get there. It'll happen. It'll be awesome.


00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.860
I feel like I'm in the race with people like Rusty Van Wick


00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.140
and Anthony Shaw and maybe Brian.


00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.700
I feel like Brian can sneak his way on.


00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.380
- Brian does sneak in periodically.


00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.820
He's an easy one to reach out to and like,


00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.620
hey, we gotta cover this topic and I can't find somebody.


00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.740
You wanna drop in and do it?


00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.180
Yeah, awesome.


00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.060
So what do you think?


00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.260
Should we jump into the tips straight away?


00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.940
- Let's do it, I'm excited to.


00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.500
- Awesome.


00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:29.820
Well, I think there's a lot of little things that you pick up when you work in software.


00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:36.340
And I feel like you and I share this belief that software is the superpower to whatever you're actually trying to do.


00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.980
Right. You talk so much about, "I found this cool tool to automate that."


00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.260
Like, you've even created mail through automation.


00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.420
And stuff like that. It's beautiful.


00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:54.980
Yeah, I you know, I think the coolest part about tools is that they are that they're tools.


00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:02.420
I love artists that are able to take a tool that wasn't designed for that thing and like,


00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.020
make something truly beautiful with it. Like I mean, the first time I saw like Bob Ross on like


00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.340
TV, you see some of the brushes that he uses. And they're not like these little ones that you've


00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.260
used in like your high school arts class. They're like shop brushes that you would use like paint


00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.280
in a fence and like somehow he could still make


00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.520
these crazy pictures in like 30 minutes.


00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.320
- That's where the happy trees come from.


00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.900
- Exactly.


00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.980
- Awesome, so the things we're gonna cover here,


00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.780
they're like that, they're a bunch of little things


00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.700
and I specifically chose them because I thought


00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.800
they're incredibly easy to try out, right?


00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.740
They're not like, oh, you know what you should do?


00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.220
You should move to a NoSQL key value store database.


00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.060
That would be better.


00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.480
You're like, yeah, no, that's like a month


00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.580
and then we have to live with the consequences.


00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.560
Like, so everything that we're gonna talk about here,


00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.680
I believe is something you could try out really quick


00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.120
and say, yeah, that's cool.


00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.440
Actually, no, maybe not.


00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.060
Okay, if we got some time,


00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.200
I'm gonna throw in some extra ones there.


00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.200
- I think everything here is free,


00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.960
except for like one or two things.


00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.440
So like, absolutely.


00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.720
Your download manager like might get exhausted,


00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.320
but your bank account won't.


00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.040
- Exactly, exactly.


00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.840
So the first one that I wanted to start out with,


00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.900
and I feel like this is a very bimodal distribution,


00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.960
is shells or terminals or command prompts,


00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.360
depending on your origin,


00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.760
where you're coming to think about these things.


00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.480
And I say bimodal because I feel like


00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.960
there's one group of developers that lives in the shell,


00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.840
even more than me by quite a wide margin.


00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.680
They're incredibly talented there.


00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.960
And then there's a whole group that are just like,


00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.000
well, whatever is on my system, that's what I'm using.


00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.520
What do you think? What would your estimation on that population be like?


00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:57.400
it's tough because I think as the community continues to grow, you're going to have more and


00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:05.240
more people that are not back in my day, we had the green screen with the blinky dot, you know,


00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.560
like, I don't think you're going to have as many people that are doing that. And I don't think


00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:16.920
that's necessarily a bad thing. I think the first programming thing I learned was like, when I was


00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.920
I was like eight or nine and like my grandfather was using Eclipse.


00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.920
>> Yeah.


00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.480
>> It's like I don't go anywhere near Eclipse now,


00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.840
like that's not me at all.


00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.680
But nowadays, even in my IDE,


00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.360
I find myself often going into Vim to make changes.


00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.920
In my IDE, instead of just clicking on the file right there,


00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.120
making the change, it's like, "Oh,


00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.640
I know I can do this faster just from my muscle memory."


00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.160
I think having at least some knowledge of,


00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.160
if I need to dig into the shell, I can.


00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.920
I think that was actually one of the things you talked about here


00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.520
was using different tools to augment the shell.


00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.360
>> Yeah.


00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.300
>> I think that even if you're not going to go in there a lot,


00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.160
at least when you have to go in there,


00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.680
make it at least enjoyable.


00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.840
>> Yeah. There's a bunch of little tools.


00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.980
There really seems to be a renaissance


00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.080
of the tools around the terminal.


00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.620
We've got things like rich and textual,


00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.820
allowing people to make really cool apps there.


00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.980
We've got, oh, my Z shell, oh, my posh,


00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.460
bunch of things there, some stuff called fig.io.


00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.380
I'm not totally sure I want to make a recommendation


00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.660
for it yet, but I'll sort of bring it out there and so on.


00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.340
So yeah, so my recommendation was,


00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.400
if you open up your terminal or command prompt,


00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.900
if you're on Windows and you're still using cmd.exe,


00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.900
If it looks like the way it looked when you got the machine,


00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.300
there's a problem.


00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.140
You're doing it wrong.


00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.700
If it just comes out of the box and it's just cmd.exe,


00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.580
that's what you're using.


00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.560
Or if you just open up macOS and it's the white bash,


00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.160
like you're missing out on so much.


00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.100
Yeah, Brandon Brainer, hey out there in the audience,


00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.980
says I'm using Fig and it's pretty awesome.


00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.980
I just started checking out Fig.


00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.140
I'll pull up Fig in a moment.


00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.840
We'll talk about that.


00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.880
So on one hand, there's a bunch of people


00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.460
who are incredibly talented,


00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.080
but there's also all these things


00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.080
that support being more efficient on the terminal.


00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.520
So for example, I'm a big fan of omyzsh,


00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.320
o-my-z-s-h, at o-my-z-dot-s-h,


00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.480
which I learned that macOS now switched to zshell


00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.920
as the default terminal, so that's interesting,


00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.440
but that means it's even easier to install omyzsh


00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.520
'cause you've already got ZSH or Zshell.


00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.000
And there's just so many little nice tricks.


00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.920
Like if you go into a directory


00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.200
and that directory happens to be within a Git repo,


00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.720
you get information about your Git repo


00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.680
right there in the prompt.


00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.920
It tells you what branch you're on


00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.360
and what repo you're in and all those kinds of things.


00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.480
If you can get it to say things


00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.920
about like the Python version that you're on and so on.


00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.000
Do you ever use Zshell?


00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.840
What do you use?


00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.120
- Yeah, I use all my Zshell.


00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:17.080
Absolutely. Like it's to me, if I'm not using it, I immediately


00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.240
know because of like, it's like, wait a minute, what's happening


00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.280
here? I'm typing stuff and nothing's happening. And I don't


00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.200
I hit tab and it didn't help. Or I hit, I typed a few things hit


00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.320
back here and it just went back to the previous command. This is


00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.080
broken. So so we can't I can't give you the name on it. Because


00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.720
I guess we'll try to be a family friendly episode. But there's


00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.560
One of the things I like about my Z shell is that they have


00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.720
these plugins that do a lot of the configuration for you,


00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.480
which is already a big help.


00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.120
>> Yeah, autocomplete and all sorts of things.


00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.040
>> Not even that, just the fact that I don't have to go into


00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.560
my ZSHRC and then put a bunch of


00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.880
path statements and this crazy shell scripting to make things work.


00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.920
I can just go to the plugin section and type something in.


00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.560
But one of my favorite ones,


00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.280
The command for it is WTF,


00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.800
so if you know, you know.


00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.880
But the way that it works is if you type in something wrong,


00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.480
like if you mistype it,


00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:23.180
if you type in the magical phrase,


00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.880
it'll go, "Oh, I think you meant to type in this."


00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.480
You can just hit Y and then it inputs it in for you.


00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.080
If you can't remember what's


00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.840
that one weird command that you have to use,


00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.480
if you're using something like sed or oc,


00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.080
which I will, I have a another suggestion


00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.600
if you're using those still, like, you can be like,


00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.680
oh, I think you meant awk/this, not awk/this other thing.


00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.120
Yeah, like, yeah, that's what I meant.


00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.640
And you just said, okay. - That's awesome.


00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.680
There's one also that is the spelling out


00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.760
of the last of those three letters.


00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.200
- Yeah. - In there.


00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.960
And you type that and it'll say, did you,


00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.280
like, if you do like a get checkout


00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.800
and it meant get branch or something like that,


00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.260
you can just type that and go, did you mean this?


00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.460
You say yes, and it'll fix it.


00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.200
Yeah, it sounds similar as well.


00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.040
That's awesome.


00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.400
- Yeah, and things like FastD and ASDF,


00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.500
like ASDF I'm sure we'll talk about later,


00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.560
but FastD, like the fact that you can do things


00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.480
like fuzzy searching,


00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.680
you don't have to remember the exact path.


00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.680
You just know the name of the directory


00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.520
you want to go into.


00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.680
You hit Z space, the name of the directory,


00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.080
hit enter, and then now you're in that directory.


00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.080
And if it ever messes up, you just hit tab,


00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.760
and then you can manually set it


00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.200
to whatever you want it to be so in the future,


00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.920
it doesn't mess up again.


00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.560
To me, it's like you're missing out on a very modern


00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.040
and clean browser experience if you're not kind of unleashing


00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.600
it with some of these extra plugins


00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.520
and oh my Z shell is the way to start with those.


00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.040
- To me, it feels a little bit like I'm programming


00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.680
in notepad versus I'm programming in PyCharm or VS Code.


00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.240
Like, why would you not want all this stuff


00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.560
that can help you with what you're trying to do?


00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.800
Okay, if you just take the base one.


00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.560
All right, so now if you're in Mac,


00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.880
I think macOS has the best shell of all the OSs.


00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.880
And then you've got Linux,


00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.320
there's a lot of good stuff there,


00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.380
they're very, very similar.


00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.680
But then if you're on Windows,


00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.560
I felt like that's just a different world, right?


00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.920
It's just, you're not meant to be


00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.740
on the terminal command prompt that much.


00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.520
Until recently.


00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.360
So Microsoft released this thing called


00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.420
the Windows Terminal,


00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.680
which I started using on my Windows machines.


00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.840
and I really like the Windows Terminal.


00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.080
There's a bunch of good stuff in there.


00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.680
And in particular, you can install Oh My Posh on there


00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.400
and get fantastic similar experiences


00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.700
over on Windows Terminal plus Oh My Posh.


00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.240
- Yeah, I haven't gotten to play around


00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.520
with the new Windows Terminal experience,


00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.720
but everything that I've seen makes me really impressed


00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.440
with what they've been able to do in the last few years.


00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.360
- Yeah, totally.


00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.280
And you can set up Windows so that


00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.800
If you just say open command prompt, open terminal,


00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.520
the default terminal is the Windows terminal.


00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.760
And then within Windows terminal,


00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.600
you can set up the new PowerShell,


00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.600
the PowerShell 7 or whatever it is,


00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.200
not the old school PowerShell 3 or command prompt version.


00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.220
So it'll also drop in to like the latest version


00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.560
with Oh My Posh set up,


00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.800
and then you're in a pretty good place


00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.320
on Windows actually.


00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.600
- Yeah, and I guess on Mac too, I mean,


00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.200
terminal is fine, use iTerm.


00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.920
Like iTerm2, it is--


00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:38.240
unless you're using a shell emulator of some sort,


00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.600
I would highly suggest iTerm2 to replace it.


00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.480
OK.


00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.960
Thanks for the recommendation.


00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.040
Now, a couple other things.


00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.120
A lot of time-- we're going slow.


00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.920
But we'll make it.


00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.500
We'll make it.


00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.480
We've got a lot of stuff to cover.


00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.160
Something I came across--


00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.880
This is the most exciting one for me,


00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.920
because it's like, oh, you want recommendations.


00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.960
I'm here for it.


00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.760
Yeah, absolutely.


00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.960
Oh, it's so good.


00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.160
Yeah, if we spend a lot of time here,


00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.060
I think that's also totally fine.


00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.200
So one of the things I much prefer about


00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.640
all my Z shell over say bash is I could type


00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.400
git space and hit the up arrow


00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.240
and it'll only show me stuff that started with git.


00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.160
So if I'm like, all right, what were the git commands


00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.080
I recently did?


00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.640
I hit up arrow, up arrow and it'll cycle through


00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.200
and very common like SSH.


00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.320
And like, I need the third server I was recently on


00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.160
and I don't wanna type it.


00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.760
So SSH space, up arrow, up arrow, up arrow, enter, right?


00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.620
And that's really good.


00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.500
Something I've been using for about a month now


00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.540
that's really neat was recommended to us


00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.580
by somebody listening to Python Bytes.


00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.420
We covered it there.


00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.300
It was McFly.


00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.060
Are you familiar with McFly?


00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.020
- I'm not.


00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.660
And now I wanna know,


00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.380
'cause I have a very specific wish


00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.940
that OhMyZshell would do.


00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.500
And if this does it, I will Insta-download it.


00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.260
- Okay, first thing that makes this nice


00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:58.260
is it integrates in a non-conflicting way with OhMyZshell.


00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.400
So I have McFly and my Z shell working together.


00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.420
Okay.


00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.380
So McFly, what it does is if you type normally,


00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.580
if you type control R, it'll go to a reverse search


00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.500
like on bash or Z shell or whatever, right?


00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.060
And that's I find to be very useless.


00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.060
- I've never done that.


00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.900
- Yeah.


00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.900
You know, I'll tell you what I do.


00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.660
I'm like, oh, I tried to type something else


00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.500
and I accidentally hit it.


00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.460
I'm like, darn it, I gotta get out of this thing.


00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.740
I know that you can search for stuff historically


00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.660
and it's useful.


00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.660
But my, what I already talked about with the up arrow stuff,


00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.820
That's like the way I go through history in Z shell,


00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.160
like open my Z shell, really nice.


00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.480
But this, imagine if you could just say,


00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.940
actually, what I want you to do


00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.000
is use artificial intelligence, a context,


00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.500
and fuzzy matching to show me a dropdown


00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.700
Emacs-like experience from my history that I can then run.


00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.280
So what you can do is you can type a part of a command


00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.880
and hit Control + R, and this replaces your Control + R


00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.300
with this like full screen select mode


00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.000
that'll show you all the stuff, which is really cool.


00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
The stuff that matches,


00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.360
and it doesn't have to just be the beginning,


00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.080
it can match in the middle of strings and commands.


00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.080
So you're like, "Oh, I checked out this branch.


00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.240
"I don't remember where it was."


00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.960
Or you just type part of the word of the branch


00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.040
and hit Control + R and then boom,


00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.620
there's all the commands you ever issued to that branch,


00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.920
basically, which is fantastic.


00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.060
It uses context.


00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.740
So if you're in a certain directory,


00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.280
or you had just typed one command


00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.400
that's usually followed by another command,


00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.820
it'll give you different ordering on your history,


00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.980
not just the order you typed in,


00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.060
but like usually go to this directory and type that.


00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.100
So you're in this directory, you ask for help on it.


00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.660
So we're gonna suggest that one first.


00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.940
Isn't that cool?


00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.380
- See, that's the exact problem that I had


00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.500
was the directory sensitive like context.


00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.340
And I mean, I guess the big example for me is


00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.980
if I'm building something in like Flask,


00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.140
I often use something like Tailwind CSS


00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.780
to do the styling for it.


00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.580
And I need to reload Tailwind from time to time


00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.020
to add the changes.


00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.540
And on some project I might put that CSS file


00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:03.540
in like static CSS tailwind/tailwindcss


00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.460
or something like that.


00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.780
And the other one might be in like static tailwindcss.


00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.660
And the thing I need to remember is when I do


00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:14.300
npx tailwindcss output, whatever that file name is,


00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.060
I always mess it up and I always put it in the wrong folder.


00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.380
So if I knew what folder, like based on history,


00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.220
it was supposed to be in, like to me that solves that problem.


00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.260
Yeah, I don't know how well it'll work there,


00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:31.260
but that's one of the types of things it takes into account.


00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.540
You can also optionally turn on fuzzy matching


00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.420
and some other stuff.


00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.460
So, so far it's been working pretty well.


00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.240
I'm pretty psyched with it.


00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.940
So yeah, this one's fun.


00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.140
I would recommend people check it out.


00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.700
It's been working well for me.


00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.220
- I'm gonna give this a shot,


00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.580
but I have one that I recently just started using,


00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.180
and I think that this is,


00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.460
This might be something that a lot of folks have had issues with.


00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:01.440
Have you ever tried to do like a grep for something and then you find the thing that


00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.100
you're looking for and then you're like, wait, but now I need to go and replace that thing.


00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.100
How do I do that?


00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.100
Yeah.


00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:16.940
Like I found a program called Amber, which has two commands to it, ambr and ambs.


00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:21.180
And the way I think I sent you a link in.


00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.340
Oh, it's a link in the doc there for you.


00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:29.340
But AMBR is a replace and AMBS is a search


00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.540
and everything else is basically the same.


00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.960
And it uses that grep-like feature.


00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.840
So you could do AMBR for, sorry, AMBS for search


00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.360
and then type in what you're searching for,


00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.860
what file directory you wanna have it search through.


00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.880
It'll do some nice, you know, stylized matching.


00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.320
And then when you're ready to replace it, just hit up,


00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.960
replace the S with an R and then add whatever you want to change it to.


00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.520
And it'll just go in and make that change. So like if, if you,


00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.960
if you don't have to remember, like how does said work or how does awkward,


00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.880
it's like, you know what, just a MBR,


00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.920
I found what I'm looking for or in MBS other way around.


00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.360
I always,


00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.320
that's the one thing I will say is I get them confused and mix them up when I'm


00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.640
talking about it. But you,


00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.680
You don't have to remember two different languages.


00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.060
You just have to remember,


00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.020
replace one character with another


00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.000
and then add whatever I want to do as my substitute.


00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.240
- Oh, that's pretty, pretty nice.


00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.080
Yeah, I haven't heard of this.


00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.560
This is great.


00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.200
So another one, the one that Brandon talked about


00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.360
that I mentioned was FigIO.


00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.160
This one is new and interesting.


00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.720
So with tools like PyCharm and VS Code,


00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.960
as you type things, you get auto-complete dropdown.


00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.460
What if you could have that as part of all of your shell?


00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.800
That's what this fig thing is.


00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.720
And it has crazy integration,


00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.500
like all sorts of coloration and stuff.


00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.920
And to the point where I have a bunch of custom icons


00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.760
I put for certain folders so I can find them more quickly,


00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.280
when it shows the folders, if I type cd space,


00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.000
like GitHub space, like talk,


00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.480
and start to type talk Python,


00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.040
it'll show the talk Python icon on the folder.


00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.560
It's auto completing in the terminal.


00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.160
Like it's, it's ridiculous.


00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.640
- This seed, this is where like,


00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.640
I wish that there was like co-pilot


00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.740
for just working through the shell.


00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.120
Like I just start typing something.


00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.760
It's oh, you meant to do this.


00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.080
And it's like, yes, exactly.


00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.120
And I hit okay and I'm good.


00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.320
- So I was trying it.


00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.280
They updated today.


00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.440
It broke some stuff.


00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.280
I got frustrated.


00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.160
I've only tried it for one day.


00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.880
So it's not a real recommendation.


00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.120
Brandon seems to like it out in the live stream.


00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.400
I thought it was pretty cool, but I can't give a full recommendation,


00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.800
but I can tell you to check that out.


00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.680
All right.


00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.040
So that was a bunch of stuff for just the shell,


00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.360
but I think this is really one of the things that's super important.


00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.400
I'd also like to point out our ship.


00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.440
Is that the one?


00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.520
Yeah, Starship was the reason why I specified


00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.600
use iTerm if you're not using some type of emulator,


00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.320
because Starship is actually pretty cool.


00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.860
Yeah, that's the one Brett Cannon definitely recommends all the time and.


00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:21.020
I definitely admire his recommendations, so this is another one.


00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:26.160
If you're not on the oh my zoo shell bandwagon, that sounds like it'd be pretty good.


00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.360
This one's more about the prompt and not the whole shell, so you can like swap it from place to place, which is also pretty cool.


00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.860
All right.


00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.060
In Grok, have you done anything with in Grok?


00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:42.260
I haven't please like I was taking a look at it and I was like this seems amazing


00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.060
But I also don't know if I have a need for this


00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.860
in grok.com


00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.460
Yeah in grok.com


00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.660
so


00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.740
There's this there's like three or four scenarios that are just so painful


00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.780
That this solves so well. So in grok is a tool that's free but also as a paid plan


00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.940
it's like a hundred dollars a year they get a hundred of my dollars every year because it's


00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.340
extra useful what you can do with the paid plan for me,


00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.980
but maybe it's not for you, so you can try it for free.


00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.480
So let me give you a scenario.


00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.480
I'm working on rewriting the credit card e-commerce system


00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.020
of TalkByLine training, yeah?


00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.420
And the way this new site that I'm at,


00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.500
or new service I'm gonna integrate with,


00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.660
tells me somebody bought something


00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.060
because you don't wanna do all the processing on your server


00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.940
'cause then you have PCI compliance and all that stuff.


00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.340
Like they do the processing and they let me know,


00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.460
and they take the person to where I tell them they need to go.


00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.420
The way they let me know is they do a webhook,


00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.940
a call into my server with the results,


00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.740
and then I create the access to the course


00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.820
and then redirect, and then when they go to that place,


00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.780
they have access to it, for example, right?


00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:51.620
- Okay.


00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.180
- So I've gotta debug this,


00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.700
and I've gotta debug their server calling into my server.


00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.500
And you're like, well, how do you do that, right?


00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.740
So one terrible way would be to like open up your router


00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.100
and put your computer straight on the internet.


00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.420
But with ngrok, you could just say ngrok,


00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.900
I wanna accept HTTP messages to my local machine.


00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.900
It opens an SSH tunnel out.


00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.140
So it doesn't have to open any firewalls, any ports.


00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.480
It can be as complicated on the way out of town


00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.320
as it wants to be.


00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.240
And then it listens on ngrok.com for an HTTPS URL


00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.000
that then is SSH tunneled back to my local server.


00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
So I put a breakpoint in PyCharm,


00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.400
go to their little app and type in my stuff and say,


00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.600
"Test this purchase," and then boom, paused in PyCharm,


00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.100
pausing their server requests as I'm going through.


00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.020
- See, I thought about something like that.


00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.640
And as soon as you pulled up the site,


00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.060
an actual use case for me popped up.


00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.660
And a good example of this was, you know,


00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.380
doing the developer advocate thing,


00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.640
I often have like builds of stuff, servers,


00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.640
you know, Docker composed instances.


00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.760
I keep all of this on a Mac mini at my house.


00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.640
The one time I actually needed it and it bit me in the backside was,


00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.480
I was in LA for KubeCon recently.


00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.280
I was like, "Oh no, I want to do this demo."


00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:16.240
But all of my database stuff is on my server at


00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.200
home because we haven't been going anywhere for a long time.


00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.320
>> You forgot what it meant to leave the home.


00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.960
>> Exactly. Had I had something like this,


00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.360
I could have just said like, you know,


00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:31.000
open up access on this port and this port only and say like,


00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.680
hey, now I can actually access data on


00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.760
my home server and keep all of my configs the same.


00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.000
Instead of doing what I had to do,


00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.120
which was like re-download all the data,


00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.760
open up a Cloud instance and then move everything to the Cloud,


00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.760
and then get a call from our company saying,


00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.280
hey, your bill went up like several hundreds of dollars, what gives?


00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.080
It's like, I'm sorry, I was downloading


00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.960
gigabytes of data.


00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.360
- I forgot and left it on, yeah.


00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.880
- Yeah, on conference Wi-Fi nonetheless.


00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.800
- Yeah, yeah, so you don't even have to open up ports.


00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:08.800
It's just like you run this and then it SSH tunnels


00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.840
in reverse back.


00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.160
It's really, really awesome.


00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.600
So, and you can just leave it running for days if you want.


00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:19.560
Another example is when we were debugging the mobile apps


00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.880
for viewing the courses,


00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.560
we just told it the URL was that, opened up the phone,


00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.280
it didn't matter if we were on LTE or whatever,


00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.040
hit a button and boom, break point again.


00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.960
Another one that I think this would be really helpful for


00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.640
is, hey, I'm in this standup meeting,


00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.960
I wanna show everybody this new feature


00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.080
we added to the website,


00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.300
but it's only on my local version, we haven't deployed it.


00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.960
But you don't wanna show it over Zoom


00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.320
'cause like the animations look crappy and all that,


00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.160
just end grok it, give everybody in the meeting a URL


00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.520
and they can interact with it live


00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.600
with all like the JavaScript fanciness.


00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.080
but it's running on your server, right?


00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.000
It's just the latest one.


00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.920
It's beautiful.


00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.180
- I was thinking about that in terms of like,


00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.840
what's the overall latency of what is happening there?


00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.840
Because in my mind, I'm like,


00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.900
this is the better way to show people things.


00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.240
It's like, you can go to this website


00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.400
and you can play around with this.


00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.240
And at the end of the day,


00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.600
like you just close the ngrok connection


00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.560
and you know, it's all done.


00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.600
You don't have to-- - Exactly, control C


00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.240
and like you're off the network again.


00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.080
Yeah. - Yeah.


00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.200
I might have to play with this as soon as we're off this call


00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.120
'cause I have a demo that I have to do soon.


00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.240
- Yeah, it's awesome.


00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.680
One of the things you get with the paid plan


00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.080
is you can create a stable URL.


00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.040
Whereas if you have a free one, it always resets the URL.


00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.400
So you gotta like reshare it, which might be fine.


00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.080
It might actually be good, but anyway.


00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:34.920
- That's good for me.


00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.080
I need it to reset on its own.


00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.560
- Yeah, so instead of trying to set up


00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.560
some crazy server setup at home


00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.520
and trying to do like router NAT routing,


00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.280
which you probably don't wanna even expose your server


00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.980
to the air, your machine to the internet,


00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.160
just fire up an ngrok session, good to go.


00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.820
I really think this is a, I've been using this like all week


00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.980
and it just reminds me how much I love it.


00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:59.120
I'm like, yep, it's just set the sandbox URL


00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.740
to have my ngrok endpoint instead of the production endpoint


00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.060
and boom, it's good to go.


00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.260
- You know, one of the things that I was thinking about


00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.700
as a productivity tip is very much


00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:11.940
for the beginners out there.


00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:16.940
Like I have always struggled in the idea of like,


00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:23.340
Oh, what do I do with all of this server admin stuff that I don't want to have to do?


00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.020
Yeah, I remember how intimidating that stuff was.


00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:44.300
Yeah. And I think that this is, you know, it's kind of a good segue between, you know, the next topic that you're going to talk about and this existing one. And that's like the idea of like you, it's okay to embrace, you know, not necessarily the serverless ecosystem, but like the


00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:49.540
power like the past product as a service ecosystem to where like,


00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:54.620
"Hey, I just want to build my app and I don't want to be a sysadmin,


00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.860
can I do that?"


00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.620
Now with stuff like Netlify,


00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.900
Vercel, DigitalOcean has a thing now like-


00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.020
>> Heroku.


00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:02.860
>> Heroku.


00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:03.460
>> Yeah.


00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.340
>> Like taking advantage of some of those things or


00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.820
even doing something like ngrok that


00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.700
you can spin up when you're done with it, tear it down.


00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:17.940
I think that was actually a tip on the last time we were in this call is like I often build admin consoles and flask


00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:26.240
Do them locally have them connect to my servers off-site to do any database changes and that way I know for a fact


00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.900
I'm not leaving anything secure open because I'm just doing local hosts


00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.540
It's sending the API calls and when I'm done and I close the terminal it


00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:40.480
Disconnects and there's no more access unless someone has my API keys. I'm not putting anything up on the server


00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.200
I'm not putting anything up in GitHub and I don't have to maintain it and be worried about it. I can just go Oh


00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:53.780
Python app dot PI enter and then go to localhost 5000 make my changes and then close it and then cool


00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:58.800
Got access don't got access that easy. Yeah, that's very nice. I love it


00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:05.580
Jaley out there also says I'm using in grok for to work with my RPI


00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.400
Raspberry Pi


00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:12.500
Yeah, for home security services works great. Yeah, that's another thing on like devices like that aren't necessarily listening


00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:17.520
You get him to sort of push out and then start listening again on the public. Yeah, there's a lot of good use of the


00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.080
Intelligence in grok thing. It's it's the thing of beauty. All right


00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:27.040
So another thing that I think speaking of people who are beginners and struggle, right?


00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:32.900
Has to do with security right you push something out on the internet


00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.540
You know, who knows what's gonna how quickly will it get owned right? It's not gonna be good


00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.660
And there's a bunch of recommendations from a wasp


00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:49.100
That they say look these types of things we found to be


00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.820
common vulnerabilities


00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.620
that websites have


00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.780
like


00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.060
injection


00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.060
cross-site scripting


00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.500
Other things like if you don't explicitly disallow it,


00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.140
people can take your site and embed them in an iframe


00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.900
and then wrap other stuff around it, right?


00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:11.060
Like go to your login screen,


00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.980
but actually overlay something that captures the keystrokes


00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.040
or other weird things, right?


00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.820
So how do you keep track of these?


00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:18.940
How do you prevent them?


00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.900
So this thing called SecurePy is fantastic.


00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.940
And it's got the most amazing


00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.860
IPI name, just secure, like how they got that name,


00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.180
I have no idea, that's incredible.


00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.300
But it integrates, one of the things I like


00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.460
is it just, it's like a couple of lines of code


00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.340
to integrate into whatever framework you're using.


00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:45.500
So, court, responder, sanic, flask, FastAPI,


00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.380
Django, pyramid, AIO, HTTP, like all of these things.


00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.180
And it's just a couple of lines of code


00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.400
to get it integrated.


00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.340
Usually it's some kind of like middleware type of thing


00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.500
that you wrap it up with.


00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.060
And so in order to use it,


00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.260
all you have to do is create one of these secure headers


00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.220
and then you set a couple of values


00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.220
like whether or not you wanna allow cross-site scripting


00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.940
and things like that.


00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:16.100
And then what it'll do is it'll automatically


00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.420
put all the security controlling headers


00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.800
into the response coming out of your website.


00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.520
So for example, X content type options, no sniff.


00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.760
Did you know you hear that?


00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.560
Want to protect against that X frame thing or I frame,


00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.780
X frame options, same origin.


00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.500
So that you can do it, but no one else.


00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.660
Things about the referrers and so on.


00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:41.840
Cross site origin for JavaScript and whatnot.


00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.400
So it's super easy to integrate with what you're doing.


00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:50.200
Also, it's like a tamper proof cookie type of option


00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.120
for doing that as well.


00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.040
So what do you think of this one?


00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.020
- So I know when I first saw this, I was like,


00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.000
oh, what is this obfuscation of like


00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.620
what's happening behind the scenes?


00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.240
And I literally just talked about this 30 seconds ago,


00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.040
like, oh, you don't wanna have to think about that stuff.


00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.640
Yeah, I'm gonna completely walk that back.


00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:13.120
And in my own projects that I'm building,


00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.200
it's like, I wanna know what's happening.


00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.520
I just don't wanna have to maintain it.


00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.640
Which is like, and that's kind of where


00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.640
you actually, your response in like showing how this works


00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.400
and showing like, it's just adding the headers


00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.240
on that it needs, makes me feel a lot better


00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.720
because I mean, I'm in a DevOps space where we're like,


00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.480
we do a lot of like APM stuff.


00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.840
And I just got off a live stream where someone was like,


00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.240
yeah, it just connects to your platform.


00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.960
And it's like looking and digging and getting like logging


00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.080
of all of this stuff that like is a dependency


00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.720
of the tools that you're using.


00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.800
and it's like, oh, that's kind of, I mean, it's cool.


00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.720
- Should it be doing that?


00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.560
I don't know if it should be.


00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.160
- I mean, it's great because I know that I can drill down


00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.160
and see where the problem is, but at the same time,


00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.520
like I wanna know that it's doing that.


00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:05.080
And that's my concern with tools like this,


00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.320
but I will always say,


00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.440
leave security to people who know security


00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.160
and don't try to roll your own.


00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.280
I think Jacob Kaplan Moss said that.


00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.640
- Yeah, that's good advice.


00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.200
One of the things that in my dream world imagination


00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.160
or idealification of this thing is,


00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.880
if a new recommendation comes out,


00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.100
some new header that we should all be adding


00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.040
that we are not paying attention to,


00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.080
that we should have added, but we didn't


00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.180
for some sort of configuration change for security,


00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.700
SecurePy could be updated to make those changes


00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.140
and you just pick them up


00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.540
and you don't even have to know that that was improved.


00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.220
So, directly.


00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:57.180
That makes me wonder, do you know if any of these protections come in at a platform level?


00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:03.940
Like if you're using something like a Netlify, you say, "Oh, I use Netlify functions to load a thing."


00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:10.060
I wonder if Netlify is doing something on their end to also include some of these.


00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:16.300
And that's where a lot of my concern comes from, is that if down the road I'm doing a thing


00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.960
and then like my provider is also doing a thing,


00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.800
am I going to run into some goofy error


00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.240
that I have to troubleshoot?


00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.320
- I would guess because it's headers,


00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.840
just they would overwrite what your app creates.


00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.760
This is more intended for like Flask or Django


00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.600
or something like that,


00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.780
where you're kind of the beginning and the end


00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.600
of the security statement, you know what I mean?


00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.760
Something like that.


00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.600
- Absolutely, and like I said,


00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.160
I will always leave security to,


00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.840
in the hands of people who get paid to think about security


00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.720
because I know I should be thinking about it.


00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.960
And the most secure thing I can do is say,


00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.320
hey, I need an adult in this situation.


00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.360
- Yeah, I've thought a lot about this


00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.960
and I haven't, absolutely.


00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.600
I also would like to point out that


00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.360
if you're not doing Python and web apps,


00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.760
I mean, first of all, what's wrong with you?


00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.800
No, but seriously, second,


00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.880
there's tools like this for other frameworks


00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.720
for like ASP.NET and other ones.


00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.640
If you want it, if you seek it out,


00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.440
they have a totally different names.


00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.160
Very unlikely to have a cool name like secure,


00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.520
but there's other tools for other frameworks


00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.880
and platforms as well.


00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.640
- You'll have to listen to talk


00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.960
whatever that language is to me, I guess,


00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.520
to hear about those. - Exactly.


00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.800
Yeah, yeah.


00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.440
Talk Cobalt to me about our APIs.


00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.280
All right.


00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.300
So yeah, to integrate it is like incredibly easy.


00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.520
So that's super cool.


00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.760
All right, so here's a recommendation,


00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.600
which is in some sense in contrast


00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.040
to how much I went on and on


00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.320
about how much I love the shell and the terminal.


00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.080
And that is don't shy away from UIs for your Git.


00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.480
For source control basically.


00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.280
- This is the one that I was like,


00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.760
oh, I'm ready to fight on this one.


00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.960
- All right, let's battle.


00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.140
So here's the thing.


00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:01.680
I think there's a lot of value to having


00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.400
nice visualizations of what's happening, right?


00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.400
Like for example, my first thing I pulled up for this


00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.160
was source tree from Atlassian.


00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.600
And when you open up a repo, you see the branch history


00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.960
and who has made what changes and where the tags are


00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.120
all in like one quick shot.


00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.160
And you still have hotkeys.


00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.800
Like if you wanna just do a pull latest,


00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.900
you shift command L and that's the same as get pull.


00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.500
Wanna push, shift command.


00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.180
I don't remember what the push button is.


00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.240
P maybe, but you know, there's a couple of hotkeys


00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.520
that are sort of give you a quick access


00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.320
that is like being on the terminal,


00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.080
but you also have really nice and beautiful things


00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.880
one for if you're an expert or two,


00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.600
like if you have two branches, you want to merge one,


00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.020
you drag one branch on the other


00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.560
and that merges the changes from one to the other.


00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.320
There's things that help people who are new a lot.


00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.440
So I find this doesn't mean you should never do


00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.080
source control in the terminal or with Git in the terminal,


00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.080
but that also shouldn't mean you should never use UI tools.


00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.080
That's my stance.


00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.440
How do you feel about this?


00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.280
- Okay. - The same, I can tell.


00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.120
You feel the same.


00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.480
- With that phrasing, I'm like, fine.


00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.460
But I took the first word on this one.


00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.420
So, go from there.


00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:23.080
So I have many a tweet that has said, I have made said mistake.


00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.700
I need to unmistake it.


00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.520
And how do I do this?


00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.180
And almost like clockwork, I do it wrong.


00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:36.080
And I wind up, yeah, I just, I wind up deleting things that weren't


00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.980
supposed to be deleted and then I'm banging my head against the wall and


00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.980
and figuring out how do I fix this.


00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.780
>> The biggest Git undo is just delete the whole directory.


00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.420
>> That is actually.


00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.360
>> Check it out again and just hope that you can get it back.


00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.100
>> Yeah, that's exactly my solution in most cases.


00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.760
Again, I also want to say,


00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.140
I am not saying that any type of UI is bad.


00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.200
I'm just saying, if you're getting started,


00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:08.960
learn the basics because you're going to be on a server one day,


00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:13.500
You're not going to have access to tower or source tree or something else.


00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.800
And you're going to need to know what was that command.


00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:21.140
Like what is cherry picking, get whatever, whatever.


00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.140
And it's like, you're going to need to know it.


00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.640
And if you have an over reliance


00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.640
and you don't understand what's happening behind the scenes,


00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.900
that's when you're going to be in trouble.


00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.940
So for me, it is very much


00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.480
You can use the UIs,


00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.540
you can use the tools,


00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.500
know what's happening behind the scenes,


00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.460
and know what they are as well.


00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.580
I love this comment,


00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:48.900
why make things more difficult?


00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.100
There's so much to memorize in our languages already,


00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.360
why do we need to memorize the Git commands as well?


00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.580
That's the thing.


00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.260
You don't have to memorize all of the commands.


00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.860
You just need to get


00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.980
a good understanding of what you do need to know.


00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.260
On top of that, plus we already talked about,


00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.780
use things like OhMyZSH,


00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.540
where you can just tap through it and get a list,


00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.940
and you can use man, and you can learn


00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.000
about all the different commands and what they do.


00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.540
But again, if you hit "Delete"


00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:22.420
on the GitHub interface, what is that doing?


00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.180
Is that deleting your entire repo?


00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.980
Is that deleting the clone that you have locally?


00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.300
What is happening?


00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.140
What happens when you go to use some other tool and they use


00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.600
the exact same phrasing to do something different.


00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.500
What happens when you go to a new company


00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.760
and your Git workflow changes and you're like,


00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.580
"Oh, well now we don't do branch stuff,


00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.620
we do tagging and things like that."


00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:50.900
I'm not saying that you can't use the UI.


00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.540
I'm just saying it's good to understand what the UI is doing


00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.100
so that if you ever need to change it or if you ever


00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.580
need to change what UI you're using,


00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.020
you can do so and do it in confidence.


00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.980
And when you're stuck in that one situation


00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.580
that I have personally been in, where it's like,


00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.460
crap, I don't have the button that I press.


00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.100
Like, what do I need to do?


00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.900
Like, you can at least have a better chance


00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.300
at making the right decision.


00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.860
- Yeah, no, that's fair.


00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.260
I would say to Robert, I think RJL is Robert.


00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.020
Hopefully I got that right, Robert.


00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:25.820
There's probably five or six Git commands


00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.060
you need to actually know how to do.


00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:31.300
And then the rest, I would go to the UI.


00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.700
Because to me, it's like, do I really need to like


00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.460
visualize the branching in some other way?


00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.740
Nah, I'll just open up source tree and look at it.


00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.420
That's gonna be totally fine.


00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.260
But if I need to know how, you know,


00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:47.260
get pull, get commit, get add, get push, get checkout.


00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.940
Like these are the various things I need to know, you know.


00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.900
But like a complicated rebase, maybe I'll just go,


00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:58.900
all right, I'm gonna find the server or the UI


00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.060
and I'm gonna do it.


00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.100
We've all done that interactive rebase


00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.980
and we're just like, why am I doing?


00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.500
We get like three of them through


00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.660
and we're like, yeah, sure, whatever.


00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.300
Just accept the rest of them and go.


00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.460
And then you realize that you weren't,


00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.960
you shouldn't have done that.


00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.140
(laughing)


00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.060
I'm totally there.


00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.100
- Why am I in VI?


00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.140
Just accept theirs, accept theirs.


00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.300
- But I think that that's the thing is like,


00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:26.220
no, I'm not typing git commit dash M,


00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.660
insert my message and then all the files


00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:29.700
that I wanna commit.


00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:34.700
I'm often just doing git add.gcam for git commit,


00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.620
add message, all, and then whatever my message is.


00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:41.220
But at least I understand what those commands are doing.


00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:44.540
So that down the road, and to be fair.


00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.500
And to be fair, sometimes the tools,


00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.920
like you're also giving access to your repo.


00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.780
Like, I mean, it's cool if you're using like GitHub


00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.820
and everything's public, but like,


00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:59.540
you're also adding a layer of opening


00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.120
to another company.


00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:06.400
And I would be hesitant to say that


00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.880
there's no company out there


00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.160
that's not going to be vulnerable to some type of attack.


00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.140
And then you got to revoke access to your repos


00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:15.020
and things like that.


00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.200
Because again, in order for these UIs to work,


00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.480
you're giving it a lot of access to what you're doing.


00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.320
So again-


00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.640
- And some of them, I think,


00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.260
I think source tree mostly just work,


00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.880
like you can just drag a folder onto it


00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.880
and it'll start to do its thing.


00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.040
Whereas there's other ones where you're like,


00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:37.040
OAuth, all the OAuth signing into GitHub or GitLab


00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.400
or something, yeah.


00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.480
All right, I'm gonna let Anthony from the audience


00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.920
have the final word here.


00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.400
Don't roll over SourceTree today.


00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.080
- Yeah, not at all, not at all.


00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.480
Like use the tools.


00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.800
I think Tower's great.


00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.160
I think the GitHub UI is great.


00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.480
I've never actually used SourceTree.


00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.920
I'm sure it's fine.


00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.440
- I would say SourceTree is the one that hides the least.


00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.800
It's there to help you and there's UI,


00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.900
but like it's actually pretty complicated in what it does.


00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.600
And I don't mean that in a bad way.


00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.400
Like it's it's not hiding everything behind pseudo actions.


00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.740
Yeah. And I'll also throw out there.


00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.240
I am probably not the best, you know, subject test case for this


00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.040
because most of the project that projects that I work on,


00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.500
it's just me or it's me and like one or two other people.


00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.500
So it's easy to follow that tree.


00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:24.400
If you've got 50 people working on a thing and you need to be able


00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.380
to trace back and forth what's happening.


00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:29.120
I totally get using a tool to help with that.


00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:33.560
>> Yeah. If you find yourself over here,


00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.560
in the XKCD world,


00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.600
where you start out writing beautiful code,


00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.700
like created main loop and timing control,


00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.280
enabled config parser,


00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.040
and at the end you'd find yourself just eight A's,


00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.680
A, F, D, K, F, S,


00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.800
G, my hands are typing worse.


00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.160
Yeah, you're breaking down there.


00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.000
- All right.


00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:53.820
- Yeah.


00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.040
- So I reset this on accident.


00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.960
- Where did they get access to my Git commit messages?


00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.120
- Exactly, how did they do that?


00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.320
All right, there's also GitHub desktop,


00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.600
which I reckon is kind of neat.


00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.940
I would say the other area that just point out really quick


00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.220
is a lot of the tools we have already have built in


00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.200
awesome Git stuff.


00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.120
Like PyCharm has fantastic Git integration


00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.340
and so does VS Code with like Git lens and stuff.


00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:20.240
So you might already have a UI for it


00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.200
if you just press the button, you know what I mean?


00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.120
- Yeah.


00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.480
- All right, keeping along with Git,


00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.440
if you've got a Git repo that you've forked,


00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.120
something that's always driven me crazy is like,


00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.880
I've got to go and there's a series of events


00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.800
I got to do on the terminal, like add a remote origin,


00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.160
and then I can earn upstream origin,


00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:46.160
and then I can do some commands to pull the upstream origin


00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:50.040
and merge it back into my main branch and so on.


00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.720
And so GitHub added a button that just says,


00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:53.600
have you forked this?


00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.600
Oh, look, there are changes.


00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.120
Press this button to make them the same.


00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.840
I love this fetch upstream and fetch and merge.


00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.800
This is awesome.


00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.320
- I really wanna give a shout out to like,


00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.080
a lot of the features that Git has added recently


00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.760
that like, every time I go in there


00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.200
and like I see something, I'm like, oh, this is nice.


00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.480
- Yeah, GitHub is coming along.


00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:17.880
Yeah, there was concern about what would happen to it


00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.720
and Microsoft bought it.


00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:25.120
it's only gotten better. Yeah, I think because I'm such a professional open source contributor,


00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:33.440
there was a misspelling in a readme and I wanted to tilt my glasses up my brim and go, "Well,


00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:40.400
actually, you swapped the T and the H in without." Yeah. And you're like, "And by the way,


00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:47.200
I am a contributor to Django now." Exactly. And just the process of doing all of those things


00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:52.360
can sometimes be more when it's like this is a simple fix and like in your mind you're


00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:57.240
like now I gotta go do this thing I need to fork the code base I need to go and do all


00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:02.520
this stuff and like I literally did everything just in the browser and then it was like hey


00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:06.920
do you want to sync this or hey do you want to create a new you know do you want to put


00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:11.200
this on the branch do you want to do a new thing how do you want the PR to look hey they


00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.640
accepted your PR do you want to go ahead and delete this and it's like all this maintenance


00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.800
stuff that I am bad at doing.


00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.320
I am glad that GitHub will be like,


00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.760
"Hey, it looks like you merged a PR."


00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.420
To me, Microsoft just clipified


00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.440
GitHub and made it easier for me to do what I do.


00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.720
>> Good afternoon, Jay.


00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.960
Are you trying to write a letter or merge PR?


00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.920
>> It looks like you're trying to rebase.


00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.840
Would you like some help with that?


00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.720
>> Wait a minute, first, why are you rebasing?


00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.920
I love this. This is like a single button click.


00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.480
it solves a lot of the problems really nice


00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.480
because keeping your forks in sync have been a problem.


00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.040
What I would love to do is just say,


00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.840
yes, and do this every day and don't tell me about it ever again.


00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.120
Just make it happen. Make it as if they're committing to mine.


00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.800
It depends on what I'm working on,


00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.940
but there's a lot I would be happy to do that on.


00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:04.840
>> Yeah. I think as long as I maybe give me a deadline,


00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:09.560
give me like, "Hey, we're going to auto merge this in after five days."


00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.560
At least that way you can get the messages of like,


00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.680
"Hey, we broke this thing.


00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.800
don't do it, don't do it.


00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:14.800
Yeah, sure.


00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:18.240
So for me, there's like two reasons I'll pork a repo.


00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.280
One is because I really love it and I want to contribute to or explore.


00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:25.480
The other is just I really want a personal copy of this thing that I can control.


00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.540
Just because I depend on this so much, I want a copy of it.


00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.100
And for those just keep it in sync.


00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.340
You know, I can always go back to the version before.


00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:39.200
I was wondering, like, how many like were you doing this for like dependency


00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:45.500
management. But I don't know if I I don't know how much I'm doing


00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.020
that I'm not really forking someone else's code and then


00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:52.640
like bundling it in with my projects. But I mean, there, I'm


00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.860
never going to say never, because that's the one time you


00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.860
need to go and do that.


00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:01.380
Yeah, yeah, for sure. All right. Well, so glad that we're I mean,


00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:05.980
we're only partway into like, we're halfway through now. And


00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.760
we're just barely into the podcast, so it'll be fine.


00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:25.640
Oh, I mean, some of some of these I am just like, I agree next. Like, yeah, this one's perfect. If you're not using Let's Encrypt, and like you're not a company that buys their own certificates and other things like just just use Let's Encrypt.


00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:32.920
Yeah, and it is so simple. I would say getting a certificate is kind of a


00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:37.720
challenge. I remember being on the phone with a certificate company and having to


00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:41.840
verify the identity of where's the office and what do you do there? Maybe


00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.800
we'll give you an SSL certificate. It might've been one of those enhanced ones


00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:49.360
or something that didn't really matter, but they thought it would matter. And it


00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.300
was just such a hassle. And then, oh my goodness, if you've got to renew that


00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:57.000
and you don't remember the details or the person who originally got it is gone.


00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.880
What a hassle, right?


00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:03.880
And so one of the benefits of Let's Encrypt is not just you get an SSL certificate,


00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.520
CLS certificate, you also get them automatically renewed


00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:11.680
behind the scenes without you doing anything. That's beautiful.


00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.920
And this is, I mean, again, this is a plus one for those platforms as a service.


00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.920
I know like Jamstack and all this other stuff,


00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.920
people are like, I don't want to have time to deal with that.


00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.800
The fact that I can just commit to GitHub,


00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.000
push my repo up to GitHub,


00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.720
and then from there I know my website's done


00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:33.400
and I don't have to worry about the certificate renewals


00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.800
and everything else.


00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.360
I will always go that route,


00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.920
but I do have servers that I run for like,


00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.720
hey, I wanna show you what it looks like to run the server.


00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:45.480
Let's Encrypt is absolutely the first step in that process.


00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.760
Like, okay, let's make sure this is good to go.


00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.840
- And I always imagined this would be kind of complicated


00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.840
until I actually saw the steps.


00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:56.840
The steps are apt install software properties common,


00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:02.280
apt add apt repository universe,


00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.920
apt update, and then just apt install certbot,


00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.960
Python 3 certbot nginx,


00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.000
and then just run certbot nginx.


00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:09.840
That's it.


00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.660
- Boom.


00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.400
- Then say yes to the prompts.


00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.480
You know what I mean?


00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:14.320
That's it.


00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.840
Yeah, it's really, really not that intimidating.


00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.360
So people should absolutely be using it.


00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.920
And the audience RJL Robert says,


00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.840
hey, don't forget about FlaskCon in a couple of weeks.


00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.680
Michael will be speaking at it.


00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.520
I will indeed, that'll be super fun.


00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.360
And he agrees with us.


00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.360
- I'm also speaking at a FlaskCon.


00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.200
- You're speaking at FlaskCon?


00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.520
I had no idea, awesome.


00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.740
We didn't even get a chance to connect.


00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:34.320
What is your talk on?


00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.320
- My talk is on utilizing the Google Maps autocomplete API


00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:43.340
to do location-based searching with Elasticsearch.


00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:48.120
And I'm demoing it in my college board clone.


00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.640
So anybody that's in high school getting ready


00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.440
to go to college and wants to know how much


00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.560
student loan debt you're gonna go into,


00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.840
yeah, check out my talk.


00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:56.680
- There you go, awesome.


00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:57.840
No, congratulations on being there.


00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.640
You could run ngrok and let the audience


00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:01.480
interact with it, right?


00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:02.920
- That's why I said I was gonna test this


00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.880
as soon as we're done here.


00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.120
- Nice, yeah, I'm doing Flask plus HTMX stuff.


00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:08.940
I'm a big fan of that.


00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:10.840
And it's not even on my list of my suggestions.


00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.920
All right, here's another one I find really challenging


00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.200
is testing web apps.


00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.620
And yes, you should write very focused tests,


00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:21.080
like, oh, here's the e-commerce section,


00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:25.340
and this is what the price is when I set a discount code,


00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:28.180
and I'm not logged in, and I tried to purchase it.


00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:30.740
But sometimes you wanna know,


00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:34.260
will the thing just catch on fire in 500,


00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.420
or will it actually work if I were


00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.220
to push this to production?


00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:42.480
So this recommendation is that if you have a site map,


00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.020
and most sites do, one of your tests could be


00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.700
and just request all the pages and see if they 500 or 404


00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:51.620
or if they return something that looks like a response,


00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:55.340
like 200, 201, 302, something like that.


00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.960
- I'm trying to remember what it was called.


00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.020
I think it was like pytest request or something like that


00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.060
that does something similar.


00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:05.260
But I love the idea of using site maps.


00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.540
I'm gonna do a shameless plug.


00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:09.260
One of the things that we started doing


00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.820
with our search platform is adding a crawler


00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:15.820
that you can tell it to just go and brute force


00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:19.460
all of the links on your site and make sure they're good,


00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:21.020
but you're gonna miss something.


00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:22.640
Like you will miss something that way,


00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.980
but you can also just add a sitemap.


00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.260
So sitemaps are a great tool.


00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:30.040
And it's one of those things that like a lot of,


00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.380
like I don't think Flask does it by default,


00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:33.940
Django doesn't do it by default,


00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:37.620
but there's usually a very simple way


00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:40.540
to add a sitemap to those applications.


00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:45.260
And I think if anything, this is just another reason


00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.060
to implement sitemaps.


00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:49.620
Also search engines do like sitemaps.


00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:53.620
So if you wanna get another bump in the SEO ranking,


00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:54.740
this is the way to do it.


00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.660
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.180
Super easy.


00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:00.460
It's not a lot of work for the relative benefit you get.


00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:01.500
John out in the audience says,


00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.740
ngrok sounds similar to Cloudflare tunnels,


00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:04.960
which are also free.


00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:05.800
That's awesome.


00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.520
I have no idea what Cloudflare tunnels are,


00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.020
but it's a good recommendation.


00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:09.860
People can check that out.


00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:10.700
- Thanks, John.


00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.280
- I'm gonna add that to the list.


00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.580
- Right on.


00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.020
All right, here's actually the code I put up there.


00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:19.840
Like it literally is 15 lines of code or something


00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.580
to do the sitemap test, which is pretty straightforward.


00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.620
Another one, you're talking about the SEO aspect.


00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:28.820
Google has been paying attention


00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.540
to how fast your site responds


00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.820
and not just what is the server response,


00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:37.100
but how long does it take to get all the JavaScript


00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.260
and parse it and run it?


00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:41.220
How long does it take to read the HTML


00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.020
and then get the images and resize them


00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.340
and all kinds of stuff.


00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:49.020
So there's a place called PageSpeed Insights by Google,


00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:52.500
which you can just go put any webpage,


00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.980
your root page or some sub page in there.


00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:59.060
And it'll give you not just what they think your speed is,


00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.740
but what their recommendations are.


00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:06.060
Like your image is too large here


00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:09.220
on wimpy processors like phones,


00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.100
it's gonna slow down the page load,


00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.620
so you should resize,


00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.460
like you're saying 300 in your CSS,


00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.560
but the image is 1,000, just make it 300.


00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:20.580
- I'm writing the orange on my site,


00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:24.100
so I got, I'm at the high, I'm like right underneath green,


00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:26.660
so I got some changes I can do,


00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.980
but one of the things that I thought about this,


00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:34.820
and I love the idea, and I absolutely agree with it 100%,


00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:38.260
One, if you're doing static, static tends to be faster.


00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:39.100
- Oh yeah. - Just gonna throw


00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:39.980
that in there.


00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:40.820
But, 'cause I love static sites.


00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:44.540
- But it's not as easy of a fix as you would think.


00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:46.380
There's still a lot of problems you can have


00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:47.820
with a static page.


00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:50.220
- Yeah, and actually one of the things


00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.980
that I wanted to add onto that,


00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.020
speaking of like scores and ranking,


00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:57.860
is the idea of accessibility scores and ranking as well.


00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.580
We don't wanna be dominoes.


00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.400
We don't wanna be the company that gets sued


00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.780
for not having good accessibility.


00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:08.140
Luckily, I don't think anyone here is building stuff like that.


00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.940
And if you are, hi, welcome.


00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.340
I'd love to chat sometime.


00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:13.540
But I do think that it's important to be


00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.140
good stewards in the community.


00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:18.340
That's something that I think is really great.


00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:21.580
And if your site isn't accessible, you're


00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:23.220
cutting off a lot of people.


00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:26.260
And a lot of people are like, well, it's hard to do this.


00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.700
And what else can I do?


00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:29.780
There are a lot of great tools out there.


00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:31.500
The one that I'm going to promote


00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:36.500
is WAVE, which is the WAVE web accessibility tool.


00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:39.620
And it gives you a bunch of different things.


00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:42.060
It even does its own evaluation.


00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:46.860
And you can use it to say how accessible is my website.


00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:48.660
- Yeah, that's cool.


00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:50.620
Definitely people should check that out.


00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:52.960
This is important.


00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.540
I think it might even be legally required.


00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.860
And then also page speed is starting to be used


00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.680
for actual ranking as well.


00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:00.940
So people should consider that.


00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:05.220
All right, here's an interesting one, which I don't know how you feel about this,


00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:12.620
but I find if I set up a server and the server's job is to run a website or an API


00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:21.100
and I log into it, there is about a half of 1% chance that I want to change details


00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.860
about the service of the system Python.


00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:29.060
There's a 99.5% chance that anything I need to change is with packages


00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:33.460
or details or commands involving the service I set up.


00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.540
And I found I was always, I would log in there,


00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:36.980
like, okay, well, where's the virtual environment?


00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:38.100
I got to activate this thing,


00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:40.820
and now I can issue the pip install this new thing


00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:45.820
or do some other command that I needed to do on the server.


00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.460
And then it occurred to me, like,


00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:48.540
why do I do this every time?


00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:52.340
Why don't I just set my ZSHRC to say the last thing


00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:55.620
is to source activate the virtual environment.


00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:57.220
So now when my servers, when I log in,


00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.220
at least the ones that are web servers,


00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.680
it automatically activates the virtual environment


01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.420
that runs the web app.


01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:07.260
- So are you familiar with DRMV, D-I-R-E-N-V?


01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.520
- Yes.


01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.360
- So to me, my solution here is DRMV.


01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.520
For those that don't know. - Tell people what this is.


01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.360
Yeah.


01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:19.240
- Yeah, so DRMV is this way to load an environment


01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.960
in based on the path that you're in.


01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:28.800
And in most cases, this works for just environment variables,


01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.680
which I mean, I love it means I don't have to put stuff in open source,


01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.300
I don't have to risk putting a password in there,


01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.440
I can just point to an environment variable, load that stuff in,


01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:41.060
and then know that if I'm actually in that folder,


01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.600
then the variables are loaded properly.


01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.160
Right, exactly. If you're in the folder that contains the somewhere above it


01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.820
contains the virtual environment, it's going to use that set up.


01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:53.180
- Exactly, and the thing that's really cool about this


01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:56.260
is there's another tool called ASDF


01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.740
that uses something similar to PyEnvironment or pyenv


01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:05.180
that you can put into your environment variables to say,


01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:08.400
layout Python and the Python version.


01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.400
And it creates a virtual environment


01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.420
the same way that when you load into that directory,


01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:17.020
you're loading into a virtual environment


01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.740
that you can control the actual version of Python


01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:20.780
that you wanna run.


01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.380
and that works for both pip and the Python environment.


01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:28.260
So when it's like calling pie and V every time you,


01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:32.700
you change directories into a certain, you know, path.


01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:35.060
And to me, like, this is the new way of doing it.


01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.660
When Python 310 came out,


01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:39.860
all I had to do when I wanted to test for 310


01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.860
was change my env RC to say layout Python 3.9.1


01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.980
to 3.10.0.


01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.740
And from there, that was it.


01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.700
I CD'd out of it, CD'd back in,


01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:53.820
it created a new environment,


01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.420
I reloaded my requirements and I was off to the races.


01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:58.180
- That's pretty awesome, yeah.


01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.020
Yeah, very cool.


01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.960
Yeah, I think that's good as well.


01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:07.180
I would definitely lean heavy on that for the dev side.


01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:08.460
For the servers, I'm like,


01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:11.420
I might not log into the location I wanna be in.


01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.740
It depends on if I have a bunch of services running there,


01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:14.700
just one.


01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:15.540
- Yeah.


01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:16.860
- But yeah, those are good recommendations for sure.


01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.200
especially like I said on the dev side,


01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.020
where you're doing lots of different projects.


01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.020
- Yeah.


01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:22.860
- All right.


01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:26.020
Last one is dependencies,


01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.660
and there's all sorts of dependency stuff going on here.


01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.380
So there's levels.


01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.100
So you can pip install some package,


01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.760
like I can pip install pyramid,


01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.120
that would install pyramid.


01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.660
It'll get me the latest one,


01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.500
unless I already have it,


01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.120
then it says you already have it, so you're good,


01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.980
even if there's a newer version.


01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.820
It's cool.


01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.180
So you just do --upgrade,


01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:47.380
and you get a new one, right?


01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.600
But pyramid might install chameleon


01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.020
and my chameleon might be out of date,


01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.900
but this pip install pyramid --upgrade


01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:57.180
doesn't upgrade my chameleon, right?


01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.940
It doesn't upgrade the transitive closure


01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:03.020
of all the dependencies, which is a hassle.


01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.180
And then, you know,


01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.160
you got to remember to run these commands.


01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.140
What if there's like a security vulnerability


01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:11.220
that I just got a notification a couple of days ago,


01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.780
there was some security vulnerability


01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:13.780
and not something I'm using,


01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:17.100
but something that I'm using is using, right?


01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:18.340
Very indirect.


01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:21.260
So there's all these challenges, I think,


01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.060
around dependencies.


01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:25.580
You talked about GitHub having cool features.


01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.180
If you pin a version in your pyproject.toml


01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:33.380
or your requirements.txt,


01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.380
and there's a security problem, right?


01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.860
If I say I'm using flask 0.1,


01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.620
and there's a security vulnerability


01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:41.740
that was fixed in flask 2,


01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.780
GitHub will automatically create a PR for me


01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:46.740
and say, there's a problem, accept this PR to fix it.


01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.220
Right, that's pretty cool, right?


01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.460
- So one of the questions I had with this was,


01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.340
does pip-tools solve this second problem


01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.500
of like doing upgrade, but then it only upgrades


01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.740
like the top level and none of the stuff below?


01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:04.660
- Yes, and that is my current solution


01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:07.580
is I'm using pip-tools.


01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:10.100
And I think the command is actually pip compile


01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:14.180
I don't remember I've aliased it away. So it's like gone from my mind. I just like


01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:17.620
pip pip. I think it is pip compile update all or something like


01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:26.180
pip compile --upgrade. I did the same thing except for I never thought to just alias


01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:32.180
the whole pip compile upgrade plus pip sync like that. Exactly. Yeah I've aliased these things


01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:38.340
away. They're all down to like pip install -r requirements dash dev .txt is just p-i-r


01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:42.740
PIRD if you want to without the devies PIR like I'm all about the aliases.


01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:46.980
My NeoVim because I could never remember NVIM I just do VVI.


01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.180
Yeah nice.


01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:57.220
So the pip-tools is my current recommendation because what you do is you create a requirements.in


01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:01.220
and you put the things you would have pip installed yourself like pip install flask,


01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:05.460
pip install SQLAlchemy, not their dependencies just the things you want.


01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.660
And then when you run the command that you talked about,


01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:11.540
it'll create the requirements.txt


01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.340
with the closure of all of the dependencies


01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:17.300
and actually will indent them showing why they're in there.


01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.300
Like, Flask depends on it's dangerous.


01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.100
So it would put that in there and it would be clear,


01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.260
this is a dependency of Flask,


01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.940
and it pins the versions of all of them.


01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:30.820
And then if, for say, it drops the it's dangerous requirement


01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.100
and you rerun this again,


01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.340
that'll come out of your txt file entirely,


01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:35.300
which is also nice.


01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.000
So there's I think this is fantastic.


01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.800
You sounds like you're using it as well.


01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:45.800
Yeah, that's I mean, that's part of my default setup of any new project is install,


01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.960
you know, pip-tools and then from there build my requirements.


01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.600
I in and then immediately compile and upgrade.


01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.920
Yeah. Yeah. Awesome.


01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.420
Also, package managers for the OS like homebrew.


01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.600
I use homebrew on my macOS.


01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.600
I know there's other things you use, but that works well.


01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:07.400
Windows has chocolatey, which I think a lot of people on Windows are not using a package manager


01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.560
I think chocolatey is awesome. You can install Python that way


01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:13.800
Obviously, there's apt and other things on the Linux, right?


01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:21.400
Yeah, I I really like homebrew. I know they were I think they're now m1 there


01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:27.160
Yeah, they are one ready. Okay on this computer. We're talking on I got this one in December 2020


01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:32.300
It has the Intel homebrew on it, but my new MacBook Pro I put just the straight-up


01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:37.540
up in the Apple Silicon version on there and it's been working fine.


01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:38.780
I haven't had any problems.


01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:42.060
OK, yeah, homebrew to me, it just makes sense.


01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:45.180
The one thing that I will say is ASDF.


01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:50.860
If you're using that, your you don't want to run,


01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:55.500
you know, Pippin or brew install Python because then you have different.


01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.980
They're like your stems and stuff get all weird.


01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:04.500
So install Python through ASDF if you're using that.


01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:07.380
But other than that, like, yeah, I think homebrew is great.


01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:12.180
And I guess the other bonus to ASDF is you can use that not just for Python,


01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:15.980
but if you're doing like Ruby and you have like RVM or, you know,


01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:19.900
you need to manage node versions, which I hate managing node versions,


01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:22.140
but you have to do it, I guess.


01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:26.260
That's like you can do all of those things in that environment


01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:33.340
control area of envrc. And again, with homebrew, it's like it works, but when it doesn't work,


01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:37.740
you're just like, "Okay, great. Now I need to uninstall this. I need to run brew doctor."


01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:42.940
>> I'm going to format the computer. >> Exactly. You just need to just


01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:45.980
format your hard drive. >> It's destroyed. It's destroyed.


01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:50.620
It won't upgrade Python anymore. We're done. >> I've had so many times where just updating


01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:54.220
Python is just giving me time to be like, "Well, I'm done with this."


01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.100
- Yeah, yeah, all right.


01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.380
A couple other things out in the audience.


01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.060
Anthony suggests pip Deptry,


01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:04.220
which will show you kind of that,


01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:05.860
here's the top level things you installed


01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.420
and what they depend upon, which is great.


01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.260
That's really a good one.


01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.900
Pradafond says, "Pip Audit is a cool tool


01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.620
"if you want something on security."


01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:15.800
It's a project by Dustin Ingram,


01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.740
who is associated with PyPI.org and PyPA and stuff,


01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.380
which is awesome.


01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.180
One more thing I'll throw out there,


01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:26.560
is pip dash or pypi dash changes.


01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.000
So this just came out and you type pypi dash changes


01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.200
and you point at the Python executable


01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.480
in a virtual environment


01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.040
and it'll list all the things you have installed,


01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.840
what version they are, how old they were.


01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.160
Like here's a thing I've installed, it's 10 years old.


01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.680
Maybe I should think of something newer,


01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.680
but also whether or not there's an update.


01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.160
So this is a fun one as well.


01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.080
- That's nice.


01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:54.640
Again, I'm really impressed with, you know, a lot of these tools and companies like I


01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:59.680
mean, the fact that, you know, Python now has some folks that are dedicated to working


01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.720
on these systems, and it's what they do.


01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.040
I mean, talking about like Lucas and having a developer in residence.


01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:11.320
I think this is the benefit that we see of this is you get these little touches that


01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:17.480
just make each version of Python not just, you know, more performant, but also nicer


01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.560
to work with and nicer to play around with.


01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.120
- Yeah, it gives you joy, not frustration


01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.840
as you work with some of these things for sure.


01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.920
- Exactly.


01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.020
- All right, so those were the 10.


01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.520
How about I just throw a real quick thing out there


01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.360
for people as a delightful little takeaway.


01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.360
Nerd fonts, have you played nerd fonts?


01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.600
- I haven't, what is this?


01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.560
- Oh my gosh.


01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.600
So if you want fonts that are good for programming


01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.600
that support font ligatures,


01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.240
and for example, the Oh My Posh I talked about,


01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.840
they have all sorts of weird like continuation


01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.480
between like a transitional characters and stuff.


01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.640
All those things test against nerd fonts


01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.080
to make sure every nerd font will work well


01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.320
in that shell fancy extension.


01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.360
So if you go over here to the downloads,


01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.760
you can see there's like a huge scroll bar,


01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.520
but of all these different fonts


01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.720
that support font ligatures, nerd fonts, et cetera,


01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.360
et cetera, that you get here.


01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.560
So, and they all come with a ton of variations.


01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:14.840
So if you wanna have a bunch of cool programming fonts,


01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.480
You've got like neto nerd font looks pretty good.


01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.480
Pro font nerd font.


01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.920
That's not a nerd action.


01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.840
Open is what is nerd font if you're dyslexic.


01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.220
- That's if you like ligatures.


01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:27.060
- You can turn them off.


01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:27.880
I mean, you can turn them off.


01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.720
- Okay.


01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.560
- You can turn them off.


01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.520
- I was gonna say, I don't wanna start that war


01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.360
of whether or not ligatures are a thing.


01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.720
- I love ligatures, but I don't wanna battle


01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.280
that out right now.


01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:39.920
But I went and installed every one of these nerd fonts


01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.760
on my new MacBook.


01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.960
It took half an hour or longer


01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.300
for that little font book app was like locked up.


01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.700
I thought it destroyed my computer,


01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:50.040
but nope, it just had 2,600 font families


01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.240
to install or something.


01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.500
- I'm glad you don't use Photoshop.


01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.620
It probably doesn't like you either.


01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:57.460
- Probably not.


01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.740
- What are all these fonts?


01:10:58.740 --> 01:10:59.580
- Exactly.


01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:02.860
No, but if you're looking for good programming fonts,


01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:05.020
I don't have one over the other to recommend,


01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.020
but there are many, many of them here.


01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:11.140
All right, and then I see Antonio out there in the audience


01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:16.820
who is saying we got to wrap this up with a notable PyPI package.


01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:24.140
I mean, I had I had two that weren't included in the list, and that was black and I sort.


01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:31.140
I'm pretty sure the folks listening know like, black is a great formatter for your code.


01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:38.740
If you're like me, and paid is a thing that you want to you want to understand and believe


01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:43.860
But from time to time you're like, but what about this weird scenario? I don't think about that anymore


01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.860
I just run black and then I'm done with it


01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:52.700
Value that black ads is not necessarily that it does the formatting like I could open up I charm go to the top level of


01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:58.440
Project right-click and save format everything in this directory and it would format it the way I told by charm


01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:02.680
I like it, but it solves the debate. It's like you don't have to debate


01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:07.020
Is there a space before the comma or after the comma does it go on one line?


01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:09.980
Or does it go on three lines like black puts it on the lines?


01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:14.220
We've agreed that we're just going to take this and nobody's gonna be 100% happy


01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:20.220
But you're gonna be 84% happy and we're just gonna stop fighting about the formatting and I sort is the exact same


01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:24.820
except for it does this with sorting your imports and I


01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:31.420
I mean, I will say sometimes when I'm writing code, it's messy. Thank goodness


01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:36.580
I have black and I sort to make it not so messy whenever I have to give a talk and then someone goes


01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.620
Is there a repo for this code?


01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.300
I'm like, give me 30 seconds,


01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.380
black, isort. Okay, now there is.


01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:47.380
>> Now I'm willing to share this.


01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.180
That's right. It's not embarrassing anymore.


01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:51.620
>> Awesome. John out in the audience says,


01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:53.980
I was just going to say black and isort.


01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:56.340
Get out of my head, Jay.


01:12:56.340 --> 01:13:03.940
>> Other than that, you've talked about rumps so many times.


01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:04.860
>> I love rumps.


01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:12.580
We can we can play the classics, you know all the time here. I personally I try to not


01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:20.980
do a lot of installation of stuff, but if I go to some of my projects really quick and


01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:27.420
just open up, you know, actually, I think I do know of one and let's see.


01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.340
I don't remember what it's called.


01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:39.140
Yeah, I have an app I built with rumps, Python 3 and Pi 2 app that's running up in my Mac


01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:40.460
terminal bar.


01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:46.780
And if I'm really unlucky, it'll get hidden in the notch of my new MacBook.


01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:48.340
I haven't played with rumps recently.


01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:52.180
I need to do some more with rumps.


01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:57.580
Honestly some of these little dependencies that I add to some of my projects that I mean,


01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:01.660
I could probably do my own, but also I don't want to like slugify.


01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:07.020
Yeah, you know if you've ever again a lot of this is just getting rid of.


01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:24.260
How do I do this? One of my projects that I just started working on is this idea of we've all done, you know, markdown and then you convert it to like a markdown table or you know you convert it like HTML and you gotta do some stuff with it and then you gotta process that HTML.


01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:27.580
But what about doing like markdown to Jason?


01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:31.580
Like where I have a markdown table and I want to convert that table into a CSV


01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:32.940
file or a Jason file.


01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:36.220
So I'm like playing around with this and in my head I am.


01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:39.580
I'm like physically pulling my hair out, but I'm also like banging my head


01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:40.780
against the wall going like.


01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.700
Oh, but how do what's the regular expression for this thing?


01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:48.220
And that's where stuff like validators is absolutely amazing because you can


01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:48.540
just go.


01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:53.660
Is this an email if it is OK good run this you know this a properly formed


01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:54.660
It is good.


01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:55.660
Okay, run this.


01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.660
Like, I don't need to rebuild those things.


01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.660
- Yeah, awesome.


01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:01.660
Yeah, a bunch of good recommendations.


01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.660
So thanks for being here, Jay.


01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:04.660
This was a lot of fun.


01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:06.660
I love just going through a bunch of these little tools


01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:08.660
because I learned a bunch from you


01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.660
and it looks like people in the audience


01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.660
have found a bunch of interesting ones


01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:13.660
that we covered as well.


01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:14.660
- I love it.


01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:16.660
I mean, as always,


01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:19.660
now that I'm a front runner for the Golden Jacket Club


01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:21.660
of, you know, Talk Python,


01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:25.380
I absolutely love coming on and you know,


01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.080
just now that you got the chat here,


01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.580
they're talking about products.


01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.420
I'm like, what's that?


01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.740
Let me add that to my list.


01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:33.340
And you know, I get to learn as much as,


01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:34.700
you know, everyone else does.


01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:35.620
- Yeah, that's awesome.


01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:36.900
Yeah, I just want to give a shout out


01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.220
to the YouTube live stream.


01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:40.420
It's been really fun to have so many of you all come


01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.720
and join the streams and give us feedback


01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.700
and thoughts during the show.


01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:45.460
I think it lets the audience have a little bit


01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.700
of representation.


01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.180
If you want to watch that one, just go to the episode page.


01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.260
You can click it right at the top, it'll be there.


01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.140
Or subscribe to the newsletter.


01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:57.740
There's a link to the YouTube videos every newsletter drop.


01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.360
They are in there absolutely every time.


01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.100
It's awesome.


01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.540
All right.


01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:04.100
Robert says, thanks again, Jay and Michael.


01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.460
This has been very informative.


01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.700
Thank you so much for being here, Robert.


01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.260
Jay, final word, call to action.


01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:10.660
People are psyched about this stuff.


01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.700
What will you tell them?


01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:15.060
Honestly, just play around with it.


01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.740
Have fun.


01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.860
Be a good steward of the community.


01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:23.860
and absolutely take someone that was like me seven years ago


01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:27.460
that was like, this Python thing seems hard,


01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:29.620
but I really like Flask, so I'm gonna keep trying it


01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:33.540
and just continue to pour time and energy into them.


01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:35.820
Trust me, it'll pay off for them in the future


01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.620
and they'll be sure to thank you


01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.460
with all the drinks that they can.


01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:42.780
And yeah, if you ever wanna get in touch with me,


01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:43.620
you can do so.


01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.980
I'm on Twitter, K-A-J-A-Y Miller on Twitter, LinkedIn.


01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:47.820
That's kind of it.


01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.060
Yeah, I'll definitely put that in the show notes as well.


01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:54.700
Yeah, and yeah, again, if you're interested in my productivity takes


01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:57.900
and wild hilarious opinions on things,


01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:01.500
but you know, you want to get outside of the Python space,


01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.140
check out Conduit on Relay.fm,


01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:09.100
Relay.fm/conduit, where we put out an episode every other week.


01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:12.540
This next one actually talks about having to do your job


01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.540
when you're in physical pain,


01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:17.420
which is something that you don't think about


01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:20.580
until you have that migraine for like the third day in a row and you're like,


01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:22.020
all right, how do I do this?


01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:25.780
My most recent example was when I fell in a river


01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:29.580
and landed on some mossy rocks and broke my finger in three or four places


01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:32.380
and couldn't and had a cast that went to the tips of my fingers


01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:34.460
could only work with one hand for two months.


01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:37.660
Let me tell you, you got to find some productivity tips


01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:39.540
to keep things going at that point.


01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.220
That was a while, a couple of years ago, but still.


01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:44.860
Yeah, it's it's all of a sudden it usually realized, oh, boy,


01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.140
I got to keep going, but this is not so easy.


01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.140
Awesome.


01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.140
Oh, man.


01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.820
Yeah, so people should check out Conduit.


01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.340
And yeah, thanks for being here.


01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:54.340
It's been great.


01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:55.340
Absolutely.


01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:56.340
Yep.


01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:57.340
Bye.


01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:58.340
Thanks, everyone, on the live stream.


01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:58.700
See you later.


01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:08.700
