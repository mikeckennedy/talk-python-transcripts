00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
- Hello, YouTube. Hello, Thomas.


00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thanks for being here. - Hello.


00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
- Good to have you on the channel at the moment


00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and on the podcast and just shortly after.


00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, those of you out there watching live,


00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
please put your comments and thoughts into the live chat


00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and we'll try to make it part of the show.


00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you're watching later, thanks for watching.


00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But can't put them...


00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Can't put your comments on the show,


00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but we still appreciate them.


00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
All right, with that, let's kick it off, Thomas.


00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Thomas, welcome to Talk Python America.


00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.680
Thomas, welcome to Talk Python to Me.


00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.440
>> Hey, thanks so much for having me.


00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.640
>> Yeah, it's great to have you here.


00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.680
I'm excited to talk about privacy.


00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.120
I feel like there was this period


00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.520
where everyone just gave up and decided privacy doesn't matter,


00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.160
either because it was a good trade-off for them at the time,


00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.640
or they just decided it was


00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.280
trying to push a rock up a hill


00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.760
that was never going to make it to the top,


00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.360
and so you just don't stress about it.


00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.520
but I feel like things are coming back a little bit


00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.520
and we all get to be semi-autonomous beings again.


00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.520
- Yeah, there's definitely been that feeling that,


00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.240
and I think actually it a little bit mirrors


00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.000
the way things are going with AI now, right?


00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.640
Where people feel like the genie's out of the bottle,


00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.360
how do we put it back?


00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.420
But I think we've actually seen that happen successfully


00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.720
with privacy where there was a long time


00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.240
when you would talk to your parents about,


00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.000
hey, maybe don't use Facebook.


00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.360
I know this happens to me at least, right?


00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.180
Personal anecdote.


00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.300
"Hey, maybe you don't use Facebook,


00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.820
you use cellular data."


00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.940
And the response is always like, "Well, who cares?


00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.300
I'm not doing anything bad anyway, why does it matter?"


00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.700
And I think we've seen very much a reversion to,


00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.060
"Hey, actually, maybe I don't want my insurance company


00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.280
to know everything about me


00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.740
and my family's medical history," type of thing.


00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.340
And people are starting to care about it again.


00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.420
And somehow we're getting that genie back in the bottle,


00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.680
which is great.


00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.140
- The internet used to be, it's this thing on the side.


00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.740
It was like a hobby or something you were interested in.


00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.140
Like, oh, I'll go on the internet and I'll read,


00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.020
read some user forums or I'll search for some interesting


00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.380
thing that I might be interested in.


00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.220
And now it's become all encompassing, right?


00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.940
Tech and everything else is interwoven so much


00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.580
that I think people are starting to realize like,


00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.380
oh, if all of these companies can buy, sell and exchange


00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.740
too much information about me,


00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.700
then that might actually have a real effect


00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.860
in my regular life, my day-to-day life, right?


00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.580
It's not just like, oh, I get weird ads


00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.460
on my hobby time off that I fiddle with the screen.


00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.900
Like, no, this is everything, right?


00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.300
And so we're gonna talk a little bit about the laws


00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.740
and the rules that are coming into place,


00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.600
a little bit of these changes,


00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.600
but mostly some platforms that you all are creating


00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.700
to allow companies, especially large companies


00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.700
with complex data intermingling to abide by these laws


00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.460
and be good citizens of this new world


00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.700
that we're talking about.


00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.620
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.020
And I think that's another thing we've seen


00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.900
as part of the shift of consumers caring about privacy


00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.020
is you also have individual engineers


00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.540
or individual contributors or managers


00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.820
or people within the organizations


00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.820
that regardless of what laws may require them to do,


00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.060
they also do care about building privacy respecting software


00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.400
just as the right thing to do.


00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.000
And I think we've seen a general trend in that as well.


00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.800
So that's been good to see.


00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.560
>>Victor: Yeah.


00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.280
Well, I'm looking forward to exploring the ideas and then


00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.760
the platform as well.


00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.220
Before we get to that, though, let's start with your story.


00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.440
How did you get into programming, Python, privacy,


00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.240
all these things?


00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.320
>>Joseph: So I actually studied politics in college.


00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.120
But my best friend was a computer science major.


00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.840
And when I found out that in college


00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.800
he was already freelancing, working at home,


00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.300
and making way more money than I did in my part-time job.


00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.180
I was like, hold on.


00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.640
I think this computer science thing might have a future.


00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.100
So I was just kind of self-taught,


00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.740
and I ended up doing some data.


00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.860
I got a data intelligence job right out of school,


00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.060
despite having zero relevant experience or knowledge.


00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.300
And I was told a week or two in to--


00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.620
I was working on this case that we had.


00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.940
And I had to pull stuff from API and put it in a database.


00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.780
and I had basically never really written a line of code before.


00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.260
And I somehow ended up on Python and somehow ended up


00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.780
with MySQL, and I made it work.


00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.340
And just from there, just fell in love


00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.740
with really the problem-solving aspect of coding


00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.660
and just creating value from basically nothing, right?


00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.380
Yeah, I can just see how that search goes.


00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.100
How do I easily pull data from API?


00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.140
Use requests in Python.


00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.140
I go, OK.


00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.220
Yeah, it was probably something similar.


00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.140
I think I had a friend in the Slack team at the time


00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.860
that was into Python or something.


00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.460
And I think I just ended up on Python.


00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.220
And it's been one of the best accidents of my life.


00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.940
Now, however many years later, still working with Python


00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.340
daily.


00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.100
Yeah, excellent.


00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.220
And now, what are you doing for a job?


00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.340
Yes, I'm working at a company called Ethica.


00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.060
So we focus on privacy tooling for engineers,


00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.740
specifically or in a broader sense these days,


00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.140
working on privacy tools in general


00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.840
that can be kind of a meeting point


00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.460
between engineers and compliance professionals, right?


00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.100
So like the compliance team lawyers,


00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.260
things of that nature, your company,


00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.140
trying to build a common ground for them


00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.920
to kind of build off of and work together.


00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.500
- Excellent, it sounds really fun.


00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.380
And you've got a cool platform


00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.600
that you all have open sourced.


00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.720
And we're gonna talk about that in a minute.


00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.260
But let's keep it high level for a moment.


00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.540
I talked about the swinging pendulum


00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.100
where it went to like, "YOLO, I don't care.


00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.140
Internet's fun, it's free, it doesn't matter to you.


00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.220
Oh my gosh, it matters.


00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.020
I want my privacy back.


00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.940
I can't believe people are doing X, Y, and Z


00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.500
and not just showing me ads with this."


00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.380
So we got the GDPR, obviously,


00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.220
that made such a huge splash


00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.220
that made me personally scramble to meet the requirements.


00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.860
And what I think is really interesting about that is


00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.140
those kinds of laws,


00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.060
and maybe I could get your thoughts on this.


00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.340
I think it's a bit of a problem or challenge.


00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.500
And these kinds of laws, you can just see through the veil.


00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.940
Like, okay, it talks about internet company or something,


00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.240
but what they mean is Facebook, Google,


00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.240
There are five huge companies or something in the world, most of them on the West Coast


00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.760
of the US that are like bullseye.


00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.080
The sites are on them and these laws trying to apply to them.


00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.080
Yes.


00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.280
In general, outside of it too, but like it's those five or whatever that really were the


00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.000
catalyst for this.


00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.960
Whereas, small companies like me are like, "Oh, well, I have to have a recorded history


00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.640
of an opt-in, not just an opt-in in principle, but I need the date and a time and I need


00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.920
a record.


00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.820
So I got to go rewrite my systems so that I can have a record of opt-in for communications


00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.820
if I have it.


00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:23.020
And when there's one or two of you at a company, that shuts the company down for weeks.


00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.760
When there's 10 people at Google that I got to stop and go do that, Google just keeps


00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760
going.


00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.760
And so there's this tension of, I think, unintended harm


00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.960
that can come from these by asking


00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.520
for a blanket equal compliance


00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.560
when they're really what the laws are written for


00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.800
and people have in mind are like these mega trillion dollar


00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.400
companies that have unlimited money to solve these problems.


00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.520
How do you see that in the world?


00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.020
- Yeah, it's been, so I think specifically


00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.940
with the CCPA, which is the California Consumer Privacy Act, they kind of noticed that and


00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.300
there is actually a cutoff, I believe, I want to say something like revenue or valuation


00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.740
under 50 million. So there is kind of a safety clause for smaller businesses because like


00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:20.460
you said, when GDPR came in and it just went after everyone, right, irrespective of size


00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:26.180
or resources. And it was actually more of a punishment for smaller companies because


00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.520
Because like you said, if they come for you, Michael, and they say, "Hey, talk Python.


00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520
You're doing great.


00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.520
You've got all this data.


00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.580
All these people are buying courses, but you're not keeping track of consent or whatever.


00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.420
You're a one or two person team.


00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.580
Now you've got to stop for weeks."


00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.940
And Google and Facebook, they have the privilege and the ability to, yeah, they're going to


00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.240
hire privacy engineers and they're going to try to do things the right way.


00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.780
But if they could find a few hundred million, it's just the cost of doing business.


00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.100
they are calculating these fines as part of their annual spend.


00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.860
And that's just how they do it.


00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.860
Whereas for you, that could be something


00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.020
that ends your business or puts you in hot water


00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.980
or does something else.


00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.460
Or maybe just you don't even want


00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.380
to do business in the EU anymore because it's


00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.700
too much of a hassle compared to what it was before.


00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.180
So I think, yes, GDPR really misstepped there.


00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.060
And it did end up punishing a lot of smaller businesses.


00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.340
But I think they've learned from that.


00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.880
they're trying to iterate on it.


00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.260
I think cookie consent is a big one.


00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.220
They're now kind of revisiting that and saying, hold on,


00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.580
did we implement this the right way?


00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.820
Did everyone implement this the right way?


00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.780
And I think the CCPA is building on that


00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.460
in a really good way.


00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.780
And we can see there's also a lot of shared language.


00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.740
So I think that even though GDPR was,


00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:44.780
it was disruptive and it probably hurt the people


00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.440
that it didn't mean to hurt, at least initially,


00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.360
that it was still a pretty good base for us to work off of


00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.180
just in terms of a general privacy framework


00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:58.700
and will hopefully get us to a place that's a little bit more equitable in terms of who's being punished and who's actually dangerous.


00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.220
And like you said, it was like a few outliers that brought about this requirement, right?


00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:09.540
It was Facebook acquiring WhatsApp and then doing uncool things with access to both data sets.


00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.780
It was things like that, that this was designed to stop.


00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:16.100
And I think slowly we're getting to a place where it's being wielded more in that vein.


00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:22.900
Yeah, the US Supreme Court has not ruled yet on Section 230, but who knows what that's going to unleash.


00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.300
That's a whole other topic. We're not on that one.


00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:31.300
But you know, I mean, there's still large waves like that could crest and crash and whatnot.


00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:41.540
I do want to come out and say explicitly, I'm not against the GDPR, and I'm not unhappy that I changed my systems around to comply to it.


00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.020
It's really important to me.


00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.300
I've talked to advertisers and told them,


00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.020
no, we're not inserting tracking pixels.


00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.900
We're not inserting other types of retargeting stuff for you.


00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.220
If you need that more than you need to talk to my audience,


00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.460
you go find some other audience.


00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.580
Like, I've told them to go away.


00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.620
And usually they're like, okay, fine.


00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.300
We'll work around it.


00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.540
But I also just want to kind of put that out there.


00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.940
It's like, look, these rules come in aimed at the top


00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.340
and sweep up a bunch of other people as well, right?


00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.140
So I think there's like this mixed bag,


00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.940
I guess is what I'm trying to say.


00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.100
- Yeah, there definitely is.


00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.140
And funny you mentioned that, like there are,


00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.820
I was shocked for you to see to find out


00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.380
that there are podcasts I'm subscribed to,


00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.020
not yours, so don't worry.


00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.020
Podcasts I'm subscribed to that I can't even download


00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.900
on a VPN because it is just like,


00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.660
there's some tracking requirement that my VPN blocks


00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.180
that it won't even let me download the episode,


00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.220
which is just crazy to think that that's kind of the point


00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.980
where we're at, even with podcasts.


00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.920
- It's really terrible.


00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.460
And a lot of that I think comes from people


00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.560
wanting to do dynamic ad insertion.


00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.460
- Yeah.


00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.940
- Right, they wanna go, okay,


00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.940
this person is coming from this IP address in this town,


00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.620
and we have this extra information we've gathered


00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.820
from like these nefarious back channels.


00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.980
And we're pretty sure, pretty sure that's Thomas,


00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.460
and he works in tech, and we're gonna offer,


00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.740
we're gonna dynamically insert this, you know,


00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:13.900
And if they if there's walls that stop that, then then maybe maybe not.


00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.820
Yeah. Let me go on one more really, really quick rant here.


00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.980
Just absolutely.


00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.860
Cook this cookie consent.


00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.420
Now, I'll try to not be on the soapbox too much for this.


00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:29.020
But I think right here at the CCPA, the California law, this right to


00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.420
non-discrimination for exercising your rights.


00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:36.860
When I look at the Web these days, those all these cookie pop up notifications,


00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.380
They're like the plague.


00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.420
They're just everywhere.


00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.820
Many of them just say, you have to just say, OK, or go away.


00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.860
And it's like, OK, well, that's not a lot of control I have.


00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.940
On the other hand, we have a lot of technology control.


00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.180
I have on my network, I have NextDNS,


00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.420
which will block almost all the tracking and retargeting


00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.540
and all of that stuff.


00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.840
I use Vivaldi with the ad blocker on.


00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.340
And I'll go to these places, and they'll say, turn off your ad


00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.980
blocker.


00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.380
They'll show you the cookie thing,


00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.300
and they'll say, turn off your ad blocker.


00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.620
If you don't turn it off, you don't get to come in.


00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.260
I think what they should have done


00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.700
instead of having a law that says,


00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.660
you have to tell people you're tracking them


00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.520
and then make them press okay


00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.300
and then track the heck out of them.


00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.060
Say like kind of this last line here in the CCPA,


00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.420
say there's a right to non-discrimination


00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.420
for exercising your privacy


00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.220
and say, you should be able to have an ad blocker


00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.780
or other tracking protection mechanisms


00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.220
without being punished or blocked


00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.060
compared to the other visitors.


00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:39.900
That would have solved it.


00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.340
And there'd be no need for these pop-ups everywhere.


00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.580
We could just, if as a informed citizenship,


00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.820
if we decide we wanna run ad blockers


00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.660
or other types of tracking blockers,


00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.820
we can and we just go about our business, right?


00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.700
Like that would have been a more sophisticated solution,


00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.420
I think, than making everybody say,


00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.300
"Okay, I agree, you're tracking me, let's go."


00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.820
Yeah, this is-- yeah, obviously, I


00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.620
think it's being contentious, right?


00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.220
I can barely remember the internet now,


00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.460
despite it being just a few years ago, when--


00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.620
and now it's just so normal.


00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.780
You go to a website, and you're just waiting, right?


00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.900
You're waiting for the other shoe to drop,


00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.340
and the thing pops up, and you click the thing.


00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.060
Where's the cookie?


00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:19.620
OK, I got it.


00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:20.740
Exactly.


00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.300
It's in the top or the bottom of this one?


00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.740
Yeah, it's a mini game every time you go to a new website.


00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.260
And there are even browsers now that


00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.980
have a toggle of just project.


00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.420
Just don't show me cookie consent.


00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.100
Just do it for me type of thing, right?


00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.100
I accept them.


00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.100
I accept them.


00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.100
Yeah.


00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.980
And it's, you know, I understand why it was there, right?


00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.360
They want people to be aware of what's going on, but it's kind of like, you know, you lose


00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.940
their end user license agreements or whatever.


00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.660
Like people don't, like people don't really stop to read if you're informed.


00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.660
Right.


00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.260
And again, this is where actually I think the talking about non-discrimination and kind


00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.140
of the privilege of being more privacy where there are a lot of people, right.


00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.700
If you, if you look at, you know, someone like my parents who, you know, they're going


00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.980
to go to the websites, they're going to see the thing that's like, "Hey, we're using..."


00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.580
They don't know what a consent cookie is.


00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.420
They have no idea what the concept of tracking our website is.


00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.900
They don't know what the data is actually used for, anything like that.


00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.060
So once again, it's just kind of an inconvenience that I don't think really increases anyone's


00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.980
privacy, especially because a lot of companies are still using the dark pattern of you can


00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:27.220
click yes, track everything, but if you want to reject or you want to only give the required


00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:33.300
it's like another step or two and it's unobvious and it's like, you know, just a tiny little hyperlink text


00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.540
You have to click on it's not a big big flashy button light gray on dark gray


00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.020
Exactly


00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.740
Something like that


00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:49.740
Yeah, so I think we're finding our way still we're not totally figuring it out. There's there's attempts


00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.780
Sometimes I don't really have the outcome. I think people intended like this cookie consent one


00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:01.700
But there's still the idea behind it was pretty good, even if the way it came out wasn't that great.


00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.740
At least my perception. I know some people really appreciate the ability to have those buttons,


00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.940
but I just said like I'm just gonna block it no matter what I answer is not coming through, so I don't care.


00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.500
But


00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.500
companies have to live in this world, right? They have to live in a world where the pendulum is swinging back.


00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.380
So,


00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.500
I guess, you know, we talked about GDPR and I really want to go too much more into it


00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.300
at this point because we talked about so much.


00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.260
There's an interesting article called the 30 biggest GDPR finds so far.


00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.540
And it's not updated for this year, but people can look through and see what kind of, you


00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.340
know, it's the it's exactly the companies that I described for the most part, except


00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.540
for there's like some weird ones in here.


00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:51.220
I don't know if you've seen this article, but there's like H&M, this German clothing


00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.020
company where they like film their employees and then like shared that internally. And


00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:00.980
that was the violation, which was unusual. But so these are the ones that people might


00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.460
know. Go ahead. What are you going to say about that?


00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.860
I was going to say that a lot of people actually forget. I think that's an interesting one


00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:12.100
specifically because GDPR has kind of different classes of people that protects. And actually


00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:17.300
employees is absolutely one of them. Because a thing that you will see is companies will


00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.300
use internal employee data and say, well, there are employees.


00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.940
They don't have data privacy rights because they work for us.


00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.620
So we can use their information however they want to be.


00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.620
You can't do that.


00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:25.780
Right.


00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.940
GDPR says specifically, yeah, you can't sell your employees data.


00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.620
You can't use their, their, you know, biometrics for whatever


00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.740
you want to, all that kind of stuff.


00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.060
So I think it is really important.


00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.580
also that H&M got fined for that because it's showing, Hey, you have


00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.300
to treat your employees as well as your customers when it comes to data privacy.


00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.100
And I think it's pretty cool.


00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.500
Yeah.


00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.900
It's not just your web visitors.


00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.580
It's the people that.


00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.580
- Exactly, it's trying to protect everyone


00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.420
no matter what the relation is to said company.


00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.860
- Another one I think that just highlights


00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.220
the greater subtlety of all of this


00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.180
is this article in the register entitled


00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.020
Website find by German court for leaking visitors


00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.320
IP address via Google fonts.


00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.060
Are you familiar with this at all?


00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.380
- Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar with it.


00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.860
I think it's an interesting case


00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.100
because you can see the fine is 100 pounds, right?


00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.780
Sorry, not pounds, 100 euros, which


00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.580
ends up being 110 US dollars.


00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.460
And so I think it was very much meant


00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.900
to catch news headlines and just kind of warn people, hey,


00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.300
we've now kind of decided the Google Fonts is not


00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.100
going to be great.


00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.420
And so this is a very inexpensive warning


00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.620
to everyone else that maybe you should start looking into if


00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.740
you're using Google Fonts or not.


00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.380
Yeah, I find this very interesting because, again,


00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.920
it's almost like the cookie consent thing.


00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.020
This will ripple across most websites probably.


00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.320
- Right, I think people think about Google Analytics


00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.320
and some of these other like conversion tracking systems


00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.640
that you plug in and you're like,


00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.780
okay, I realize we're tracking.


00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.700
But even like really subtle little things


00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:06.240
like linking to an image of a YouTube video.


00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.080
- Yeah.


00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.420
- Like that will like drop cookies from YouTube


00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.180
and Google onto your visitors.


00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.340
and all those things, you're like, wait a minute,


00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.620
I just pointed an image, like that's nuts.


00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.460
And this is like this, when I read this,


00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.020
I thought, oh, maybe there's like one person


00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.100
that sued this company and they got $100 or something,


00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.040
I don't know.


00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.740
But what if they had 100 million visitors


00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.580
and everyone decided, oh, we'll do a class action lawsuit.


00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.900
I mean, it could explode.


00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.820
Like, I think that's why it caught the headlines so much.


00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.980
- Yeah, and so most of the time it is,


00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.420
like with these violations,


00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.820
and this is where it even gets a little bit sticky


00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.120
because individual countries, data protection,


00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.300
kind of agencies will go after companies, right?


00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.900
So like if you are, for instance,


00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.520
a lot of big ones happen in Ireland,


00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.800
because again, a lot of tech companies,


00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.040
especially like Silicon Valley tech companies


00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.480
have headquarters in Ireland.


00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.500
So you see the Irish, you know,


00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.760
privacy authority levy a lot of these fines in some cases,


00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.880
although people have criticized them


00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.040
for being kind of lenient.


00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.000
But I think in this case, it was very specifically,


00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.560
you know, for, like you said, for one reason or another,


00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.360
someone or the government just kind of decided,


00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.960
hey, we need to call out this Google hosted web font


00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.160
and kind of warn everyone else that,


00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.480
hey, maybe you shouldn't be using those.


00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.440
I don't know, it is very interesting.


00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.200
And I think I feel like a lot of these going to the radar.


00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.040
- I think they do it.


00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.000
I don't even think they name the company


00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.720
that this was applied to.


00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.260
By the way, people, if they're like, but what do we do?


00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:33.220
Fonts.bunny.net is a really cool option.


00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.680
Zero tracking, no logging, privacy first,


00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.120
you are compliant and a drop-in replacement for Google Fonts.


00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.120
So people should check that out if they're like,


00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.360
I kind of want this functionality,


00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.160
but I kind of don't want it anymore.


00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.900
Yeah, so that's a pretty cool option.


00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:57.560
All right, so that sets the stage a little bit,


00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.960
but let's maybe talk about some of the problems


00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.040
that large organizations have.


00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.920
So I know that you worked at a large organization


00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.600
where it was like, we have this,


00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.800
what data do you have about me request


00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.520
or how do you use my data request?


00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:18.000
And I can only imagine at like a multiple thousand person


00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.880
company, there's these databases and people like dip


00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.640
into them and take something and who knows where it goes.


00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.320
And then they hook with some third party other thing


00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.520
and then like, it's off to the races.


00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.920
Like, tell me what you did with that.


00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.880
Like, I don't know.


00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.800
- Yeah.


00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.520
- It's out.


00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.760
Yeah, it feels like maybe this is too much of an American


00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.920
cultural reference, but like, I take a penny, leave a penny,


00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.360
but for data, right?


00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.920
Like, you might drop something in there,


00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.160
you might take some out.


00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.400
No one really knows where it went.


00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.040
It's just now circulating in the broader economy.


00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.280
And so with that company, this is my last company,


00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.200
also a startup, and I was a data engineer there.


00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.560
So I've been mostly a data engineer until my current


00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.640
position, and it got to the point where,


00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.400
and this is gonna sound crazy, we were,


00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.280
Luckily, through the power of Snowflake and DBT and things


00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.640
like that, we were able to actually replicate


00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.840
a data warehouse per country.


00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.960
So all of our EU data stayed in EU.


00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.640
All of our Canada data stayed in Canada.


00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.880
We were basically just spinning up as many warehouses


00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.600
as we needed to.


00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.600
So when CCPA came online, we were like, all right,


00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.100
we're spinning one up in California,


00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.760
and then the rest of the US has one somewhere else.


00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.120
But that's obviously not sustainable.


00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.160
We were a relatively small data engineering team,


00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.880
automated most of it, but it was very clear that became a huge problem.


00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:40.760
It might be sustainable if it's Europe, US and other, or something like that.


00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.680
Right, exactly.


00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.520
Like Australia was slowly going to get on that list.


00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:45.840
Yeah.


00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.880
We're like, all right, the US people, they get no protections.


00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.440
We'll sell them like crazy.


00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.240
The Europeans will be real comfortable with them.


00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.080
The Canadians, they're nice.


00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.120
We'll kind of be nice with them.


00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:00.400
but these are, we're seeing this stuff pop up more and more, like more


00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.800
regionally and it's getting harder and harder to.


00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.360
>> That was the problem when it's California and then the rest of the US,


00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.240
which at the time it was a few years ago.


00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.360
Okay, so we have a data center in California to comply with CCPA,


00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.480
and then we have a data center outside of California and we're good.


00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.480
I was like, well, Virginia just passed a security law.


00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.720
I don't think we have servers in Virginia.


00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.920
I'm like, Idaho just passed.


00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.040
I don't know if there's server farms in Idaho.


00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.160
It became a problem like that where you're not going to


00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.320
spin up 50 data centers, one in each.


00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.720
Hawaii probably didn't have data centers.


00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.560
Energy's expensive there.


00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.920
- But they did, if you need to spin them up,


00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.440
you need to do it in person and it's gonna take a month.


00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.520
- Yeah, exactly, exactly.


00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.320
It was very true. - I'm sorry, I got a bad tan,


00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.080
but the data center's coming along.


00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.400
- Yeah, so it was, so that complexity, right?


00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.160
So all these different laws.


00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.520
But then on top of that, like you said,


00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.240
putting in the access controls


00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.280
for figuring out where data's going


00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:03.180
And how, so definitely having a tool like dbt, which if people don't know, it's kind


00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:07.380
of like a very programming focused data analytics tool, building models and stuff.


00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.380
So we had a good lineage draft of where all the data was coming from, what it was doing,


00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:17.520
but we still had to document our use because legally you have to have a valid use for every


00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.340
piece of data that you are storing in there and things like that.


00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.580
And so I was just spending more and more time in calls with,


00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.300
you know, our security team and our privacy professionals,


00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.380
our compliance team, just answering questions of just like,


00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.160
hey, here's a gigantic graph of all of our tables,


00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.840
all of our databases,


00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.500
just everything we could possibly be doing.


00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.500
Like, how does data flow through here?


00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.580
Like explain to me how this PI goes from here to here


00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.380
and what it's used for exactly.


00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:51.040
And that kind of, as we talked about before,


00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.360
It scales-- sorry, it should be, I think, just DBT.


00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.560
>>DBT, that's the wrong one, I know.


00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.360
>>Probably happens all the time.


00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.440
And-- but that's not really scalable.


00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.920
So again, we talked about before,


00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.680
this ended up punishing smaller companies a lot more because--


00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.520
so if you're Google, you can throw--


00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.320
you can just hire 20 people out of nowhere,


00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.840
call them privacy engineers, and just say, hey,


00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.260
It is now your full-time job to just keep track of these things


00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.640
and help us stay compliant.


00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.520
But if you're a smaller company like we were,


00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.560
then a lot of that fell to myself and the data engineering


00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.320
team, and then, of course, the product engineers as well.


00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.960
And so that makes it really difficult.


00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.520
That adds a pretty large burden to doing business.


00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.240
And after being there for a while,


00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.320
I then had an opportunity to come work at Ethica.


00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.560
And I was absolutely sold on working at Ethica


00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.760
when they said, we're trying to build a platform


00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.680
that allows engineers to just handle this


00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.600
like engineers like to, which is with automated tooling,


00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.440
with CI checks, with open source--


00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.200
yeah, with the YAML files, with open source Python code.


00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.800
And I was like, hey, this sounds great.


00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.140
I'm spending most of my day worrying about this anyway.


00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.600
I'd love to just get paid to solve


00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.960
this problem for other people.


00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.440
And that's how I ended up at Ethica.


00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.600
And it's been a journey ever since.


00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.120
And I think one of the challenges of tackling


00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.680
something like this, it's like we just talked about.


00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.640
It's such a broad problem space.


00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.120
So you can come in and you can handle


00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.280
the cookie consent thing, right?


00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.880
But then they're gonna say, well,


00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.400
to have a holistic private solution,


00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.360
we also need to handle knowing what our code does


00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.760
and data mapping and DSRs,


00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.880
which I know we're gonna get to a second.


00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.560
So there's actually, it's like this multi-pronged--


00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.520
- DSR-- - Thing you have to tackle.


00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.480
Yeah. - What's the DSR stand for?


00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.440
- Yeah, so DSR is data subject request.


00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.000
And that is-- - What data you have


00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.080
about me kind of thing.


00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:47.920
- Exactly, exactly.


00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.120
So I think one that people have probably heard before


00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.640
is there's also like the right to be forgotten


00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.480
is included in that.


00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.120
So that's the ability for me to go to a company and say,


00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.960
"Hey, I would like to see what data you have about me."


00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.160
And so you actually, I'm gonna give you my email, right?


00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.840
And that's my primary identifier on your system.


00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.320
I'm gonna give you my email,


00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.120
and then you need to go scour your entire infrastructure


00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.360
and every piece of PII and data you have related to me,


00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.280
you need to get back to me in a CSV format


00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.940
so that I can very easily see what you're tracking.


00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.240
Then you have, like I said, the right to be forgotten.


00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.400
So that is, say I'm using BigCo's whatever email service,


00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.320
and I don't want to use their service anymore.


00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.440
And I say, hey, I'm sending you a request


00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.920
to delete any and all data related to myself.


00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.640
So I no longer want to be your customer.


00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.400
I've deleted my account.


00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.460
everything with, you know, John@somecompany.com.


00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.480
You need to take that email, run it through your system


00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.640
and delete every single piece of PI related to it.


00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.640
- Yeah.


00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.880
- And so these are the, these are kind of like


00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.080
privacy protections we're talking about,


00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.240
but that stuff is, is complicated.


00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.240
And so.


00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.080
- Yeah.


00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.160
Well, I talked earlier about how it was really challenging


00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.440
for small, small companies.


00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.360
I think this thing you're talking about now is,


00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.160
it's actually not that bad for small companies.


00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.580
I think it's killer for the medium-sized business


00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.400
that doesn't have the Google-sized tech team to track it,


00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.560
but they've got a ton of people that mess with it


00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.480
and a ton of data. - Yeah, and a lot


00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.280
of complexity. - A lot of integrations.


00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.200
Yeah. - Yeah.


00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.880
And that's an interesting thing we've seen


00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.880
is that a lot of times when people are out of compliance,


00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.400
it's not actually because they are malicious


00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.740
and they don't care about people's privacy.


00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.320
It is because they just, they physically cannot.


00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.080
If you go to someone and say, "Hey, you have 100,000."


00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:45.080
This is not uncommon, like 100,000 Postgres tables.


00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.580
And you need to tell me exactly where every bit of PI is


00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.700
in those 100,000 Postgres tables.


00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.760
It's not gonna happen.


00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.520
Like no one actually knows, right?


00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.920
There's probably people that have left that may be new.


00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.880
And now there's some dangling Postgres database out there


00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.200
in AWS somewhere that has PI that they don't even know about.


00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.320
Just doesn't even show up on their maps anymore.


00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.320
And that's the biggest challenge is that


00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:14.340
It's not people, you know, doing things out of malice, it is purely the technical scale


00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.300
of the problem is just huge.


00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.960
And again, like I said, even Google with an army of privacy engineers, or meta with an


00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.800
army of privacy engineers, they still get fined all the time, because it's just not


00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.520
really possible to catch everything manually at that scale.


00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.840
And that's what most people are still trying to do is to do everything manually.


00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.660
What about bad actors?


00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:43.300
By that I mean there are companies that try to do the right thing like mine.


00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.380
You can go to the website.


00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.060
I spent a lot of this part of that two weeks.


00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:51.100
There's a button, download everything you know about me and there's a nuke my account


00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.380
completely wiped me off the face of the earth as far as you're concerned.


00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:01.660
And to my knowledge, those are totally accurate and sufficient.


00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.980
However, what if there's a company that says, "Here's all the data I have with you and here's


00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.940
the places I share it," and they leave out the three most important and dangerous ones?


00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.780
Do you know what recourse there is?


00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.060
Because it looks like they're complying.


00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.300
It looks like I requested the thing, they gave it to me.


00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.780
I asked it to be deleted, they did.


00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:23.840
Except in that dark market where they're selling it to shadow brokers for ad data and credit


00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.020
card mix-ins, and that's way more valuable.


00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.020
We'll keep that.


00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:33.220
Yeah, I mean, this comes down to somehow that we just have to get found out.


00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.820
There'd have to be an internal whistleblower.


00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.220
There'd have to be an investigation.


00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:41.300
There would have to be some kind of audit because they do, as part of GDPR,


00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:45.060
you are required to submit things like a data map, which we'll talk about in a little bit,


00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.340
which is basically, where is data going?


00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.300
What is our valid use for said data and all that kinds of stuff?


00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.340
But like you said, if there's a truly bad actor that is leaving things out


00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.300
reports on purpose and not letting customers know that they're doing certain things with


00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.940
their data. I'm actually not sure how that would get kind of discovered.


00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.900
I think you're right. Maybe a whistleblower or maybe somebody says, "There's no way this


00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:12.300
data got over there without going through there." And so I'm going to try to get some


00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:21.180
legal recourse to make you show us, make you testify, at least lie under oath.


00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:25.780
And even this was this actually was a big sticking point recently, Florida is also,


00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.500
you know, working on their own privacy law.


00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.900
And a big sticking point that I believe may not go through was that they could not agree


00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:36.940
on whether individual citizens should be allowed to sue companies for data misuse or it should


00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.060
be purely something the government handles.


00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.340
And I think that's, that's an interesting thing to think about.


00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.340
It is.


00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.340
It's one of those things that sounds amazing.


00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.340
Like, yes, sure.


00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:50.380
If you're abusing, you know, company X is abusing Thomas, Thomas should have some direct


00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:56.340
recourse, but you could easily destroy a company just by going like, let's give 50 people to


00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:01.100
all, like, here's your cookie cutter letter that we send over as part of the legal process


00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.580
and just knock them offline, right?


00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.900
Knock them out of business.


00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.620
So I can see both sides all over again.


00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.620
All right.


00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.620
So I kind of derailed you.


00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:14.860
We were talking about the types of things that these medium scale organizations really


00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.860
get hung up on.


00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:16.860
And you touched on some, but...


00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.860
Yeah.


00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.860
So, sorry.


00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:19.860
Let me...


00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:25.620
go back. So number one is just the largest issue that we see. And this scale is actually


00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.860
anywhere from medium to large, right, even with Google, and you'll probably have Twitter


00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.700
size, you know, kind of the thing. I would also bet really good money, there's no one


00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:40.620
there that really knows where everything is. It's just it's just too much to handle manually


00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.380
or within people's heads. So the number one problem is that people don't know where their


00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:49.400
data is. That's a huge issue. The number two problem is even if they know where all that


00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:55.640
data is, right, theoretically in a perfect world. If someone gives you an email and says,


00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:03.480
hey, you need to delete this email across all of your tables. Okay, I know we have this


00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:09.080
email in this PI and 100 tables and three different API's that we use because we use


00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.600
whatever Zendesk and Salesforce. Okay, so you've got that information in a perfect world.


00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.600
How do you actually execute that?


00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.600
Like, there are plenty of companies that have someone on staff full-time


00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.600
that just fulfills these DSRs and write to be forgotten and things like that.


00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.600
So it is not really efficient to say, "Okay, I've now got to manually go run


00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.100
SQL queries in 100 different database tables, 100 different databases.


00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.100
I've now got to log into three different APIs."


00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.100
And it's just...


00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.600
It's not... It's, again, not doable in an automated...


00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.600
You need to automate it.


00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.600
I'm trying to say.


00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.920
Even if you know where everything is, how do you automate that?


00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.640
That's another problem we're trying to solve.


00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.280
Then finally, it's the data mapping piece.


00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.120
You need to understand.


00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.440
You not only need to know where your data is,


00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.960
you need to know what type of data is and why you have it.


00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.520
That's really difficult.


00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.080
Because maybe three years ago,


00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.640
I did some proof of concept where I was grabbing


00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.280
people's addresses and trying to figure out


00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.720
a way to find cheaper shipping for our e-commerce website.


00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.300
And whatever, the table's still there.


00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.560
And so then three years later, someone comes and says,


00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.340
hey, I found all this PI in this database.


00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.540
Why didn't you collect this?


00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.340
What is this for?


00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.140
And I've already moved on to another company


00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.340
because it's startups.


00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.820
And that's a problem, because you


00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.220
need to have a valid use for every bit of PI


00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.300
that you have in your system.


00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:37.980
And so it's this lack of documentation and knowledge


00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.840
that just brings about all these problems.


00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.960
And again, without automated tooling,


00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.440
it's just, I just don't think it's really feasible,


00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.000
which is kind of again, where Ethica saw a place


00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.500
to solve a huge problem.


00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.980
- Probably also a little fear.


00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:56.200
By that I mean, the time, the short times that I spend


00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.480
at these larger companies,


00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.400
there were systems that were like, don't touch that.


00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.760
That runs, it's important, nobody can make it,


00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.520
nobody can fix it, we probably can't redeploy it.


00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.280
Just don't touch it.


00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.560
And what if it has a bit of data?


00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.280
It cannot have a nullable foreign key relationship.


00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.080
No, that's a strong...


00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.400
I wouldn't remove it from this table, but the thing that shall not be touched and no


00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.400
one can keep it.


00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.800
It's my problem if I break it.


00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800
I don't want that problem.


00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800
I can just stay.


00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800
That's a problem, right?


00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:31.680
Yeah, that definitely becomes a problem too.


00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.760
Things that get forgotten about, things that people don't want to touch, things that they've


00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.720
have lost the institutional knowledge of how it got there


00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.760
and how to even get out of it if they wanted to.


00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.000
Like you said, a fear of downstream breaking changes.


00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.880
So say I come in and mask this username.


00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.640
I have no idea what--


00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.440
if it's going to break some analytics tool,


00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.000
if it's going to ruin our marketing department.


00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.920
I have no idea.


00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.440
Right.


00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.880
Why can't we get an email anymore?


00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.840
Well, you see.


00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.600
Yeah, exactly.


00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.080
And so it's also this difficulty of communicating


00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.740
across the organization.


00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.300
Because oftentimes you'll get privacy engineers


00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.900
and they'll be embedded into a product, into a team.


00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.380
And theoretically, this is to talk across the entire org,


00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.580
but there's not like some centralized tool.


00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.500
There's no Zen desk of privacy where like,


00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.420
okay, our whole organization uses this one tool


00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.220
and we can put in tickets,


00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.620
or we can see what the state of privacy


00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.100
is across the organization, et cetera, things like that.


00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.460
There's nothing like that that really existed.


00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.180
And so that's when we kind of realized,


00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:39.260
okay, we need to build some kind of platform


00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.620
where it can just be like a one-stop shop


00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.680
for everything privacy engineering related.


00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.220
So that's gonna be engineers and privacy professionals.


00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.940
The engineers do their work.


00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.740
It all flows upwards into this tool.


00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.900
And then the compliance professionals


00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.380
can get all the information they need out of that tool


00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.620
and trust that it's correct


00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.500
because it's done in a programmatic way.


00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.700
- And it's automated and all the stuff that you need.


00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.100
- Right, yeah.


00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.660
Now really one final question


00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.940
before we jump into your platform


00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.820
which solves many of these problems.


00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.740
What about AI?


00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.220
What if it learned something through personal information


00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.740
and then you ask for your personal information


00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.580
because you forgot.


00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.620
(laughing)


00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.740
You can't go and show me like the node


00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.780
in the neural network that has my information.


00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:24.620
- Yeah, exactly.


00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.580
- But at the same time it knows something, right?


00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.420
- Correct.


00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.100
Yeah, so it is trained.


00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:36.340
There are different ways to deal with this.


00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:38.660
So for instance-- but like you said,


00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.740
you can never really know.


00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:45.020
So I mean, this is rabbit hole.


00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.860
So you can use AI to generate fake PII


00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.740
and then train a model on fake generated PII.


00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.420
That's one way to do it.


00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:56.300
But again, like you said, due to the very opaque nature of--


00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.500
and like you said, we're talking about actual neural nets.


00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.300
We're not just talking about machine learning,


00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.780
statistical learning models.


00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:02.660
It's like a neural network.


00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.500
That stuff becomes completely obfuscated.


00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.660
- Like mid-journey, dolly,


00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:06.820
- Yeah, exactly. - things, yeah.


00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.500
- Yeah, it becomes truly a black box.


00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.300
There's really no way to know, right?


00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.060
And that comes down to regulators stepping in


00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.060
and again, just saying,


00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.220
"Hey, you cannot use KAI in this model,"


00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.340
regardless of the fact that eventually,


00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.900
theoretically, it would be obfuscated.


00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.640
You know, that comes down to governments just saying,


00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.540
"Hey, that's not cool regardless."


00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.620
- It's gonna be so interesting as this evolves


00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.660
'cause if it was trained on that information,


00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.820
it kind of is corrupted in a sense.


00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.220
Like you can't take one person's information out.


00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.420
You'd have to read the model.


00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.300
- Exactly. - And it's so much work.


00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.340
Yeah, it's so tricky.


00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.300
So you gotta think of that up front.


00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.900
All right, so let's talk about your project, Fides.


00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.060
Tell us about Fides.


00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.520
- Absolutely, so Fides is an open source,


00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.300
I guess, tool for, platform maybe is a better word for it,


00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.100
an open source platform for privacy engineering.


00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:05.700
And it's really designed towards those two personas


00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.540
that I've talked about,


00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.380
where you have privacy professionals,


00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.400
you have a compliance team,


00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.340
and they need an easier and a more accurate way


00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.380
to interface and work with the engineering team,


00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.380
other than just calling cons as you can call us to ask them,


00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.860
hey, what does this table do?


00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.540
Which again, it's fine, like that's their job.


00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.180
They're supposed to be doing that for protecting the company


00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.040
and protecting the privacy of the user's data.


00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.440
But then on the other side, you have engineers.


00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.320
And engineers, they probably don't want to be


00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.040
in these Zoom calls all the time.


00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.360
And they would probably much rather interface


00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.800
with privacy engineering in a way


00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.840
that's more familiar with them.


00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:38.400
So CI checks, command line tools,


00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.040
YAML files, like we mentioned.


00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.320
And so we thought, okay, we need to build a tool


00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.480
that bridges that gap, right?


00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.480
Like we need to create an overlapping set of tools


00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.960
that both sides will be happy with


00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.080
and that provide a good user experience for both sides.


00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.920
And so we have Fides, right?


00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.340
So Fides is primarily Python.


00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.180
Pretty much everything's in Python.


00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:02.040
We also have TypeScript for the front end.


00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.240
We use a lot of other open source stuff


00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.760
and we're also on GitHub.


00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:11.280
So anyone that wants to use this for themselves


00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.440
is totally able to, right?


00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.240
Because we kind of fundamentally,


00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.200
I think as a privacy company,


00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.920
it's important to believe that privacy is a human right.


00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:22.600
And so while we do have some paid features,


00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.800
the vast majority are completely available.


00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.920
Like compliance is completely available for free


00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.760
and open source.


00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.160
So we don't think we should be saying,


00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.540
hey, your privacy is really important,


00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.880
but only if you pay us.


00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.720
(laughs)


00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.760
But we think any engineer should be able to come


00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.800
and look at our repo and grab FIDA's


00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.160
and then start working off of it


00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.760
and be able to respect user privacy


00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.880
within their applications


00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.320
without having to really pay anything.


00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.640
- Right, and since you brought it up,


00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.520
so Fides is this open source project


00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.200
that people can grab and fulfill and automate


00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.880
much of what we've been talking about here,


00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.240
which is awesome. - Correct.


00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.540
- And your business model with Ethica is,


00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.800
I guess what you would probably classify as open core, right?


00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.200
Like you-- - I think, yeah,


00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.040
that's how we refer to it internally.


00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.240
- Is that how you consider it, yeah?


00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.080
- Yeah, open core.


00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:18.640
We have, internally we'll call it like Fides Core,


00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.720
which is this repo, which is where a lot of the work--


00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.840
it's not like you'll see most of my PRs are in there.


00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.660
So Fides Core is really what we build on.


00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:31.360
And then we have an additional, what we call Fides Plus.


00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.640
And that is where you would get additional features that


00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.960
are really more like enterprise focused.


00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.760
So if you are--


00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.260
like I said, we're talking about those medium to very large


00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.480
enterprises where you have 100,000 tables,


00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.880
and maybe you want a machine learning classifier


00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.360
to help you figure out what kind of data is in those tables,


00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.880
then that'd be a paid feature.


00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.960
But if you just want to--


00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.760
- Like you kind of bootstrap it, like,


00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.120
we have this data, go look at it


00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.400
and tell me what you think about it, something like that?


00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.840
- Yes, exactly, exactly.


00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:04.000
So it'll walk databases, tables, fields,


00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.720
all that kind of stuff, and say,


00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.120
hey, this is probably this type of data,


00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.480
this is probably this type of data.


00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.280
You know, obviously, as accurate as we can get it.


00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.160
With the most part, things are going to be happening


00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:13.960
in OpenCore.


00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.880
So in the OpenCore product, we are


00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:24.200
going to tackle the three major things that we think


00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:28.680
are going to be required for any kind of privacy-first


00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.880
application.


00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.960
So first, we're going to let people--


00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.880
and you can see for all the YouTube viewers, video viewers


00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.540
on the right side, we've got YAML files.


00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.040
So YAML files are where you're going


00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.680
to define the primitives you want


00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.840
to use for your application.


00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.020
So we have data uses.


00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.880
you have different data category types,


00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.500
and you can define systems, data sets,


00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.740
kind of the building blocks of how you're going to describe


00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.540
and define your application from a privacy perspective.


00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.080
Once you've done that, right,


00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.400
once we have all this information


00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.480
that you've given us as metadata,


00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.900
you've given us about your application and your data sets,


00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.540
we're then able to start enforcing that automatically.


00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.960
We're able to start building those data maps


00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.000
and telling you, you know,


00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.860
hey, based on what you told us


00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.740
in your metadata annotations,


00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.120
This is everywhere your data lives,


00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.600
and this is the type of data that lives there.


00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.340
Additionally, based on those, we're going to say,


00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.220
hey, if you give us an email,


00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.640
we have actually an execution engine


00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.880
with a bunch of different connectors.


00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.720
And we're going to say, okay,


00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.260
so you've told us you have a Postgres database here,


00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.920
and you have a Mongo database here,


00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.020
and we're looking for this email,


00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.960
and these tables are going to be where the PII is.


00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.840
So it'll automatically go and execute that,


00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.880
like it builds on top of Dask,


00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.280
but we're kind of doing our own logic


00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.600
for some kind of directed acyclic graph, right?


00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.680
To go out and find that data and delete it in the right order


00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.000
or to retrieve it in the right order


00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.960
and then give it to user request.


00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.080
So we're really leveraging this power of using metadata


00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.920
to go ahead and automate all these tasks.


00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.600
We'll also more and more as we go into the future,


00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.640
we're trying to figure out ways


00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.800
to just automate it completely.


00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.520
So if we got to a point where engineers


00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.940
didn't even have to write these YAML files


00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.840
and we could just introspect the code


00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.640
and figure out quite programmatically


00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.640
what was actually going on there,


00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.240
what we need to be concerned about.


00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.040
That's kind of where we want to get to


00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.440
and where we see the future of privacy being is,


00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.840
especially with the incredible explosion


00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.080
of these large language models


00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.160
and things like chat, you begin open AI, right?


00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.800
Doing some kind of natural language processing


00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.440
to allow us to understand what the code is doing


00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.520
without burdening developers with writing YAML


00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.560
is where we hope to get to eventually as well.


00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.480
- That's ambitious, but five years ago,


00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:45.800
would have said, Oh, that's insane. Anymore. You have these large language models, good


00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.840
chunks of code, and they have a really deep understanding of what's happening. It's scary.


00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.760
Right. It's Yeah, so it's very impressive. So for now, we're still in we're still in


00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.840
YAML land, hopefully engineers are pretty comfortable there. We've been there for a


00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.240
while, I think with Kubernetes and all kinds of other tools. But yeah, hopefully, we just


00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:07.520
we just want to keep lowering the barrier to entry for for privacy compliance. And for,


00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.920
you know, building applications that are private by design.


00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.760
- Right.


00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.480
So in the parlance of your all's website,


00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:19.040
that's privacy checks as code and continuous integration.


00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.720
The two other things are programmatic subject requests


00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.200
and automated data mapping.


00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.200
It sounded like you touched on the automated data mapping,


00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.400
but talk about the programmatic subject.


00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.320
- Yeah, so the programmatic subject request


00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.280
is what I mentioned briefly about


00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.200
kind of how we build an execution graph


00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.280
for when those data requests come in.


00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.840
So again, like I said, we have that metadata,


00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.600
we know where your data lives and what type of data it is.


00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.280
So when a user says, "Hey, here's my email,


00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.400
"please get rid of all the information you have about me."


00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.680
We're able to do that subject request programmatically


00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.160
because we know, okay, we're gonna reach out


00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.960
to the Salesforce API, we're gonna reach out


00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.400
to this Postgres database users table


00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.920
where we know that data lives.


00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.240
And we're gonna do that for you automatically


00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.440
'cause like I mentioned before,


00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:08.360
There are plenty of relatively large and relatively small


00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.080
enterprises where there is someone on staff full time


00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.200
waiting for these emails to come in.


00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.440
And then they say, okay, this email needs to get deleted.


00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.320
And I've done this before, so I'm not above this.


00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.160
When I was a data engineer,


00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.360
we had to do this as well in Snowflake, right?


00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:26.320
Something comes in and they say, okay, I've got this email.


00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.340
Now I need to go to these 20 systems


00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.680
and run all these manual scripts


00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.000
and hope that I don't do it in the wrong order.


00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.500
Because like you said, if there's foreign key constraints,


00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.180
you need to know about that.


00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.840
Because if you do it in the wrong order,


00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.000
it's going to mess things up.


00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.640
So we basically handle all that for you based on the metadata.


00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.360
>> Cannot complete transaction.


00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.200
There's a foreign key constraint violation.


00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:46.560
Sorry.


00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.080
>> Correct.


00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.280
And so knowing that and being able to figure that out,


00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.360
that stuff is important.


00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.120
So we will handle that.


00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.120
And then like I mentioned with the data mapping,


00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:58.760
so this is really, really important


00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.440
for compliance professionals.


00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.440
because this is like their bread and butter.


00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.440
They have to be able to produce these data maps


00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.240
to show compliance with GDPR.


00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.440
And that's going to show all the systems


00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.940
within their application, within their enterprise,


00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.680
and then what those systems are doing and with what kind of data.


00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.180
And that's really important. And again, we can generate all this


00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.640
based off of the YAML file.


00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:25.940
And for engineers, the thing that we have is


00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.940
what we call privacy checks as CI code,


00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:33.300
or privacy checks as code in CI, where we're shifting privacy left, kind of the same way


00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:38.180
that we saw with security, right? Where you went from, okay, we pushed our application out,


00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.140
and now a security team is just going to play with the production version and figure out where


00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:45.460
there are problems. Right. We're going to disregard security. Give it to you, and then you tell us


00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.620
how you broke it. Correct. Yeah, basically. Yeah. But that's how a lot of companies treat privacy


00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.700
now too, is like, we'll kind of figure it out in production, right? Like ship it, we'll figure it


00:47:53.700 --> 00:48:00.500
it out in production. And now you see, oh, actually, there are really great static analysis


00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:05.780
tools for code, right? You have Snyk, you have various other open source versions that


00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:10.700
were like, hey, we're going to scan your code before this commit even, and are like, are


00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:15.060
you leaking secrets? Have you stored anything that maybe shouldn't be? And so we're trying


00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:21.460
to do that for privacy as well, right? So we're shifting privacy left. And based on


00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.620
this metadata and based on the policies you defined,


00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.060
we can say, "Hey, you've added this new feature


00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.460
and you've annotated in YAML.


00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.520
Now you're stating that this system is


00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.120
using user data for third-party advertising,


00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.880
and we're going to fail your CI check.


00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.700
We're going to throw an error and say, "Hey,


00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.040
there's a violation here of


00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.660
this privacy policy that your company has because you


00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.280
define you're using user data in this way,


00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.820
and that's going to break that."


00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:54.580
So again, that's just a way to short circuit


00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:58.460
that whole thing of, OK, the engineers have shipped it.


00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.780
And now someone comes running back and says, hey, hey,


00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:01.740
why did you ship this?


00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.380
You're using personal data in a way you're not supposed to be.


00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.180
So we're trying to get around that by saying,


00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.420
pretty early on, we'll know what's going on.


00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:14.860
And we can avoid pushes to main or deploys


00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.060
that don't pass the CI checks.


00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:23.060
- Okay, so as an engineer writing software in this,


00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:27.620
guarded by this feed, it's my,


00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:30.220
I have to be proactive and state how I'm using data


00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.780
if I'm bringing new data into the system


00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.140
or does it somehow get discovered?


00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.780
- No, so that is currently what is required.


00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.260
It is up to the engineers to maintain that YAML.


00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.620
So we're working on ways to automate that.


00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:46.600
And we actually have automated it for datasets


00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.560
because it's obviously much more programmatic.


00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:53.240
So if you say, hey, here's my application database,


00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.280
here's my Postgres database, and I've


00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.400
annotated every field and all that kind of stuff.


00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.760
So we can automatically scan that.


00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.600
We'd say, hey, in your YAML definition,


00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.600
you've left out these two columns, which maybe you


00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.240
added in this PR, right?


00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.780
And so before that PR goes in, it's going to remind you, hey,


00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:15.640
you need to add these two new columns to your dataset.yaml


00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.400
so that we know what's going on


00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.200
in those new database columns.


00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.480
- Okay, I can see how you might do a lot of introspection,


00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.400
like, oh, I'm using SQL model


00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.920
and here's the pedantic thing describing the table


00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.400
and here's the two new things,


00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:34.640
but then you could also traverse the usages


00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.720
of those two columns and see where they're used elsewhere


00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.840
and possibly, is there any API call


00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.560
that is like that data is being passed to, for example?


00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.560
and like, "Oh, is it coming out of..."


00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.560
Exactly.


00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.560
You might be able to find the common integrations


00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.560
and see what's happening there.


00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.560
Yeah, that's exactly what we're looking at next.


00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.560
Like I said, looking for ways to automate this.


00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.560
Even if we just had a really basic dictionary of like,


00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:06.560
"Hey, these APIs are going to be related to storing or sending user data,"


00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.560
and making sure that's annotated.


00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.560
And like you said, maybe some of those code-level annotations


00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.000
are using--


00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.400
like if you think about Pydantic,


00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.880
where you can have the field object,


00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.520
and you can define, OK, here's a field.


00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:22.440
Here's the default. Here's the description.


00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.960
And then if there was another field that was privacy category,


00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.520
data category, whatever, data use, or data subject,


00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.160
something like that, that's absolutely


00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.160
something we've been looking at as well,


00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.600
of kind of like the next step.


00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.160
Because we know, again, this comes down


00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.000
to this is still partially manual,


00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.840
and therefore still potentially error-prone.


00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:45.800
As long as we're scanning databases,


00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.600
that gives us some guarantee that there's probably not going to be


00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:53.000
an entirely new thing that we miss out on.


00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.640
But if it's sending you third-party APIs or something,


00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.240
it would still be possible.


00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.240
That's the holy grail we're trying to get to,


00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.000
is how do we just make this even easier for developers?


00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
How do we lower the barrier even further?


00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.400
Because we know this is still somewhat of a barrier to entry.


00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.560
but also hopefully still a huge step up from nothing.


00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.080
- Yeah, no, it's great.


00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:17.960
And if your job is to put together a system


00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:22.040
that can explain how it's using data


00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.200
and how that's enforced and how you're checking that,


00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.360
then something like this seems way better than code review.


00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.640
Not instead of, but it's certainly a huge bonus.


00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.720
- Correct.


00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.920
Yeah, correct, in addition to.


00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.740
- Yeah.


00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:40.100
So what we discussed here, this part feels like


00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:43.480
a GitHub Action type of plugin as part of a CI stub


00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.720
or something along those lines.


00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.040
What about the other ones?


00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.720
So for example, the programmatic subject request


00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.400
that's gonna cruise through the data


00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.680
and pull out the things, either show people what they got


00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.340
'cause they asked for it or delete it.


00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.120
Is that, like how does that run?


00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:01.920
Is that something you plug into your app?


00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:06.040
Is that a service that just has access to your data?


00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.000
- Yeah, so that would be something.


00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.640
So we actually do have a hosted version of VDEZ, right?


00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.680
So for companies that don't want to bother


00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.480
kind of hosting their own, you know,


00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.320
a database and web server and things of that nature,


00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.400
we host it.


00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.600
But all this is stuff that you could self host as well.


00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.320
Like you can deploy in your own instance.


00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.480
So we have something called the Privacy Center,


00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.720
which again is a thing that you spin up


00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.720
and you run on your side that actually would then,


00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.840
you would then link to and that is then what would


00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.160
direct the privacy requests to your backend


00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.340
if he does web server instance.


00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.080
And then that's where you would go


00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.880
and you would go, we call it the admin UI, right?


00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:44.920
Like the admin would log in


00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:45.920
or the privacy person would log in.


00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.200
They would see, oh, these are all the requests


00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.160
that have come in.


00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.520
I can approve these, I can deny these, et cetera, et cetera,


00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.720
based on what's going on there.


00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.760
Yeah, so we have the kind of the pre-deployment


00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:59.080
of the code would be the checks in CI


00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.820
and writing all those YAML files.


00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.780
And then once you deploy the application,


00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.260
we have these runtime tools,


00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.880
like you said, these subject requests,


00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.780
and that's all stuff you would deploy.


00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:10.060
Most people would do it during the Docker containers


00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:12.500
that we build and publish,


00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:15.820
or you could just download it and run it directly.


00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:16.660
Pip and Snow.


00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.700
- Yeah, okay, interesting.


00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:23.580
So basically there's a web app that you log into


00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.020
and you can either self-toast it or that can be yours


00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:30.740
and then it goes and does its magic at that point.


00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.740
What about the data mapping bit?


00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:37.540
- Yeah, and the data mapping is something


00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:42.100
where you can either log into the web portal,


00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.020
because it's gonna be assumed


00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.300
that most privacy professionals,


00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.420
most of them have legal backgrounds


00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.020
are probably not gonna wanna mess with command line tool.


00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.260
Although we do have a command line tool, right?


00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.620
For the engineers.


00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.780
So if you're an engineer,


00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:56.300
you can of course run a command line,


00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.900
you know, command that will give you


00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:04.060
the properly formatted Excel document or CSV


00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:08.060
if you want it with all of the rows in there that you need.


00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:10.400
Or again, like I said, if you're a privacy professional,


00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.700
you can log in with UI and download it that way


00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:13.900
and just have it generate it.


00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:15.320
It'll hit an endpoint, and then it


00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.580
will just give you the file back.


00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.860
OK.


00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:23.140
Seems really neat.


00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.820
You talked a bit about this automated checks


00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:27.980
with looking at the code to try to reduce


00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:30.500
the need for explicitly stating how things work.


00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:34.100
And you've got this ML higher order piece


00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:37.780
that will hunt down the private information.


00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:41.100
Where else are you, what's the roadmap beyond those things?


00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.000
Where is it going?


00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.900
- Just as much as you can talk about.


00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:49.260
- Yeah, yeah, I mean, just more and more automation, right?


00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:53.620
'Cause again, if we look at the ultimate goal


00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.340
is how do we just make privacy easier?


00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:57.340
Because it's not going away.


00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:00.040
It's only going to get more stringent.


00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.420
The fines are only going to get bigger.


00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.540
I think it's interesting that that kind of GDPR fine list


00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:09.760
ended at May, or was it May or something, March 2022.


00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.920
Since then, fines have actually only been getting bigger.


00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.840
They're basically making fines larger and larger and larger


00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:15.960
'cause they realize these tech companies


00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.960
just don't care for the most part.


00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.520
And so it's becoming more and more dangerous


00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.720
for people that aren't compliant.


00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:24.320
So, okay, how do we just make this as easy as possible?


00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.480
We know that there are people


00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.720
that probably don't want to maintain a multi-YAML.


00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.440
So it's really just anything along those lines


00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.880
of how do we lower the barrier to entry


00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.480
for people that want to be privacy compliant


00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.320
and use Vita.


00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.240
So like you said, that's going to take the form


00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:43.280
of probably more machine learning models,


00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:46.080
NLP models that are going to help us introspect the code.


00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:51.360
It could be things like the in-code annotations, right?


00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.160
Where like, okay, maybe there's now,


00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:58.180
In Pydantic, there's now a field to add privacy information,


00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.760
or maybe in DBT, the analytics we talked about before,


00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.520
which I know is used by a lot of companies.


00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.020
Maybe we add metadata in there where people can now define


00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.900
what PI is being used in there, and then we can just kind of natively read from those files


00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.500
instead of having to have our own file format, things of that nature.


00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:17.040
Really, we're just looking at any possible place


00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:22.500
and getting feedback from people of where their pain points are and how we can help solve them.


00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:26.380
- Sure, do you have any runtime things


00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:27.900
that you're thinking about?


00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.780
You've got the deploy stuff with the YAML,


00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.540
you've got the on request stuff with the other things,


00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:37.780
but we saw this JSON document come in.


00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.300
It had email, we don't know.


00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.140
- Yeah, so interesting you ask that.


00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:46.660
So we have done some research since improved concepts.


00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.980
I don't know if you're familiar with something called eBPF.


00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:53.580
It is a way, UPF, so it's a way to,


00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.740
I believe it's in Linux kernels,


00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.340
to actually monitor the traffic


00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:02.660
going back and forth between,


00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:05.520
basically over the network, right?


00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.700
And so what we've been able to do


00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:13.580
is if you have an application running in Kubernetes,


00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:16.860
then we'll deploy something and call a system scanner.


00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.540
And it is runtime, and what it's doing


00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.100
is it'll actually watch the traffic that's happening


00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:23.340
across your application in Kubernetes,


00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.380
and it will come back to you and say,


00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.620
hey, you've got these systems,


00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:29.860
they're talking to each other in this way,


00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.940
and basically build a map kind of automatically.


00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.440
So this is a really useful tool


00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.780
for if you're already running everything,


00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:41.180
and you just want someone to tell you what you have running


00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:42.780
and kind of build a topography for you,


00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:45.280
tell you all your systems, tell you all your datasets,


00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.540
tell you what the traffic looks like


00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:50.900
across your application, then yes, we are working on a tool that can do this.


00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:56.180
Okay, yeah, this ebpf@ebpf.io looks nuts.


00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:00.060
They've even programmed the Linux kernel for efficient networking, observability,


00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:04.980
tracing and security. And yeah, you could just say things like, these are all the


00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:10.420
outbound connections all of our systems are making. And these IPs are easy to resolve too.


00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:14.180
We know this one is Mailjimp. We know that one is Zendesk. What's this one?


00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:15.140
Correct.


00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.140
Yeah, exactly.


00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:17.620
So it's like, OK, so we see that we're


00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.160
making a bunch of calls to MailChimp,


00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.340
but you haven't--


00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:22.340
you've never mentioned in your metadata


00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.300
that you're talking to MailChimp.


00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:24.940
We now know that that's something


00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:26.460
we need to worry about, right?


00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:29.340
So this is also something that we have--


00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:30.720
Yeah, this is a little bit of what


00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.300
I was thinking about at runtime stuff.


00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:35.420
Like, can you watch the data flow and go, OK,


00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:38.580
this is inconsistent with what you've told me is happening?


00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:39.660
Yes, exactly.


00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:43.020
So the way it works now is you would deploy our system


00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:45.740
scanner into your environment, into your Kubernetes


00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:46.340
environment.


00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:49.300
It sits off as its own set of nodes.


00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.260
And it does its thing.


00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:51.980
And then after a certain amount of time,


00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:54.420
it'll just come back to you with, hey, this is what we saw.


00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:58.100
And it'll actually build the YAML files for you.


00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:01.900
And say, this is kind of the definition of what we saw.


01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:02.820
Very wild.


01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:05.940
All right, that's cool.


01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.060
That's cool.


01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.220
So we're getting real short on time here.


01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:15.220
I guess maybe give us just the quick report


01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:21.660
or thoughts on how the OpenCore business model


01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.500
is going for you all.


01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:27.340
I feel like going through the life cycle of this podcast,


01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:30.980
just had the eight year anniversary for running the podcast.


01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.180
I've talked to a lot of people.


01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.020
- Congratulations.


01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.620
- Eight years ago, it was a lot of,


01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.420
we accept donations and mostly.


01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:44.420
- What's the successful story for open source?


01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.740
Mostly, at least traditionally at that point,


01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:52.740
had been I'm a maintainer or major participant


01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.540
of this important library,


01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:58.620
so I got a really good paying job at a high-end tech company


01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:01.500
and high-end tech company gives me 20% time


01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.220
to work back on it, right?


01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:06.980
Kind of like I've got a benefactor-like employer


01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.300
a little bit.


01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.780
And it's moving more and more towards OpenCore


01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:14.020
and other things, I'd say both GitHub sponsors and OpenCore


01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.700
and then incredibly some like really interesting VC stuff


01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.660
that's happening as well.


01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:22.820
Those are not disjointed necessarily, right?


01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.900
Anyway, I think long story short,


01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.420
I think the OpenCore stuff, people really hit on


01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.020
with something that's seemed like it's kind of working


01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.640
for sustaining open source.


01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:39.020
Yeah, I think we've seen the similar, very similar thing.


01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:44.200
I think that we are, it is really hard to walk that line,


01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.440
but kind of where we've come down on it is,


01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:51.480
you know, with the belief that privacy is a human right,


01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.560
all the tools required to be compliant


01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.800
need to be open source, kind of like full stop.


01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.080
So for instance, like data mapping,


01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.380
that is a legal requirement.


01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.380
We're not gonna put that behind a paywall.


01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:06.680
handling those privacy requests, building those graphs


01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.760
and being able to go execute those, that is a requirement.


01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.020
You have to have that to be compliant.


01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.320
We're not going to pay all that.


01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.620
That's the line that we're trying to ride.


01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:18.960
Is it okay, anything that makes it super easy,


01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.500
the machine learning stuff, the kind of runtime scanning,


01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.960
all that kind of more advanced stuff that's more cutting edge,


01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.680
more R&D, then we'll probably put that on the paid offerings.


01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.100
right? But anything required to just get things running, because we know we


01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:38.760
actually have some very, very large companies that are using FIDA as purely


01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.400
open source, like they don't, they have zero contract with us, they don't really


01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.360
have any contact with us. But we know they're using, we know they're using


01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:50.800
FIDA regularly to do their internal privacy. And that's, I think that's a


01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.320
good place to be, right? If, if three years ago, when you had to implement GDPR


01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.940
stuff for talkpython.fm, and you stumbled across this tool that could just help


01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:03.060
you do that. And instead of two weeks, it was two or three days.


01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.540
Like for me, that still feels like a huge win. And there's


01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:08.580
still enough. There's still enough enterprise customers who


01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:12.540
have 100,000 Postgres tables that want us to help them


01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.300
classify, right? There's still enough of those people out


01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:19.340
there to make it sustainable. And it's also a competitive


01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:25.860
advantage. I think it's easier. It's easy for people to just


01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:30.180
think that, oh, because it's open source, you're kind of


01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.940
throwing away contracts you would have had otherwise.


01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:35.700
We've had a lot of people engage with us because we're open source.


01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.100
And it's not even that they don't want to pay.


01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.980
They're just saying, hey, we like your paid offering, but the fact that you also are open


01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:46.140
source and you have an open core model we can go look at and contribute to and put ideas


01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.980
into, that's really attractive for a lot of engineering teams.


01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:51.180
Because, again, that is one of our target markets.


01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.940
Yeah, I think traditionally looking back quite a ways there was.


01:03:54.940 --> 01:04:00.820
I need a company and a private commercial software behind this, so I have a SLA and


01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.460
someone to sue when things go wrong.


01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.820
And that's still the you might be able to do that.


01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.500
You might be able to crush that company because they did you wrong, but you're


01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:11.180
still not going to get your bug fixed in your software working any better because


01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:11.420
of it.


01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:11.700
Right.


01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:12.340
Right.


01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:16.300
And I think people are starting to see open source as the escape hatch, right?


01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.380
Like I can work with a company that has this premium offering on top of open


01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:24.660
source, but if worse come to worse, we'll just fork the repo and keep on the


01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:30.140
list. You know what I mean? And that way, I think a useful and constructive way,


01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:33.260
then we're going to try to sue them to make them do our deal. Right?


01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:39.100
Yeah, exactly. Talking about privacy engineering is being about risk


01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:42.740
mitigation. Having an open source product is also quite a bit of risk


01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.980
mitigation. It gives engineers time to get comfortable with it. Like you said,


01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:48.420
They can fork it.


01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:53.900
We're very open to pull requests and people opening issues


01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.860
and feature requests and things of that nature.


01:04:55.860 --> 01:05:00.260
So it just really makes it a much more pleasant process


01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:03.820
when you're just more transparent and more open.


01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:06.460
People can go and look at the code themselves.


01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.260
If they report a bug, they can probably


01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.300
go see it getting fixed in real time, et cetera,


01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.380
things like that.


01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:15.700
I think it's definitely the way that I prefer working


01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:18.140
as an engineer, I can't speak for management or anything,


01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.260
but it's definitely more fun to be able to engage


01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.900
with the community in that way.


01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.660
- Awesome, well, I'm happy to see you all


01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.900
making your way in the world


01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:29.420
based on your open source product.


01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:30.780
That's really cool.


01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.900
So I think we're about out of time


01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.300
to keep going on the subject.


01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.740
So we'll have to just wrap it up


01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.980
with the final two questions here.


01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:39.880
So if you're gonna write some code,


01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.540
work on VDes or something else Python based,


01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.380
what editor are you using these days?


01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:54.340
It's VS Code. I think it was pretty hardcore Vim until I think at one point you had someone


01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:58.540
on your podcast that was evangelizing VS Code and I went and tried it and I was like, oh,


01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:03.540
I'm very obviously more productive now. So I've stuck with VS Code ever since then. That


01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:10.260
was great. Thank you for doing that. >> Yeah, you bet. And notable PyPI package?


01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:14.420
Yeah, I'm going to give two here pretty quickly.


01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:15.420
The first one is Knox.


01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:18.580
I think I also learned about it from this podcast.


01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.660
This is how you talk Python.fm driven development.


01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:29.140
Anyway, so we were using make files before because I do a lot of work on the kind of


01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:31.480
dev experience, dev ops side.


01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.820
And so I was a big make file user.


01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:39.380
And when I basically heard, hey, it's like make but more powerful and in Python, I immediately


01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:43.140
but we tried it out and I think spent the next three days


01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.900
just completely rewriting our Makefile in Knox.


01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:46.940
It's been great.


01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.780
It has been so empowering for the other developers.


01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.460
Whereas before, Makefile was pretty archaic


01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.980
and it was pretty much only myself that would touch it.


01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:57.500
Now, the other developers feel very comfortable


01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.460
jumping into Knox and also being cross-platform.


01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.940
I develop on Windows and literally everyone else


01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.900
at the company develops on Macs.


01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:07.180
So it gives us a much more cross-platform way


01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:11.060
to handle scripting and building and things like that.


01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.500
>> Yeah, make files are quite different over


01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.180
on the Windows side.


01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:18.140
>> Yes, yes, I learned this the hard way.


01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:20.140
It was very, very often it was like,


01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:24.580
it works on my machine type of stuff going on there.


01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:27.300
And then finally, just another notable package


01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.940
is rich click.


01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:31.180
And that is, people don't know, rich


01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:34.660
is a package in Python that makes text output,


01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.900
like terminal output, look very, very nice.


01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.240
And that is a nice wrapper on click


01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.580
that makes click look very, very, very nice


01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.740
because it's wrapped in RID.


01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:46.760
So our CLI uses this.


01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.260
I think it looks great because of it.


01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:51.140
So I'd also highly recommend that if you're


01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:55.500
into looking for a more modern feeling CLI


01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:59.300
with a lot of flexibility and formatability.


01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:03.820
>>So it gives you kind of automated, colorized help text


01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:07.620
and usage text and like option.


01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:09.700
- Yeah, and you can customize that.


01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.540
A really, really powerful thing also is that


01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:16.820
it will understand markdown in your doc strings, right?


01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:20.060
So if you want to get a little more fancy,


01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.180
it also has kind of its own language that you can use.


01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:26.180
So yeah, it's been really nice


01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:27.540
'cause I was feeling a little bit jealous.


01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.540
Our UI looks really nice and our CLI didn't.


01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.380
And so I went and wanted to find something


01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:32.740
that would make the CLI look a little bit nice


01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:35.660
to poly engineers.


01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:39.100
>>Victor: It seems like, ah, that's kind of superficial.


01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:40.300
Like, who cares?


01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:43.540
Color for your silly CLI.


01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:44.860
It makes a big difference.


01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:45.500
The information--


01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.100
>>Thomas: It makes a huge difference.


01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:49.260
It makes a huge difference.


01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.860
Yeah, it really does make a huge difference.


01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:52.540
>>Victor: Awesome.


01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:55.540
Well, I think we're going to leave it here with this.


01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.460
But Thomas, thanks for being on the show.


01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.140
It's been really great to have you here.


01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:00.300
And a lot of fun.


01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:00.300
>>Thomas: Yeah, absolutely.


01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:00.820
Thanks for having me.


01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:01.500
>>Victor: And a lot of privacy.


01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.820
Yeah, good luck with the project.


01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:04.220
It looks great.


01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:05.060
- Thank you.


01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:05.880
(speaking in foreign language)


01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.880
- Yeah, see you later.


01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:16.880
