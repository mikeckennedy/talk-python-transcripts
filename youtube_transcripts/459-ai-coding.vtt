00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
- Fred, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.480
- So great to be here.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.780
Thank you so much for the invitation.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.620
Nice to be here.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.180
- Yeah.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.940
Yeah, it's lovely to have you.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.900
We're gonna have a lot of fun talking about

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.900
this app that you've built using highly powered by AI

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.220
and in different ways.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.220
It's both powered by AI, but also largely built with AI.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.140
And I think it's gonna give people an interesting look

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.980
into what is possible these days.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.740
- What is possible and the journey

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.900
of a middle-aged coder also maybe.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.140
- Yeah, I think actually that's really

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.740
an interesting thing to discuss.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.220
And maybe we could just start a little bit

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.300
with the introduction about yourself

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.040
and then talk a bit about that.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.000
So before we dive into talking about how you use

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.940
ChatGPT to largely build this app that is a SaaS product,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.020
service on the internet people pay, subscribe to,

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.180
which is the dream of many people.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.500
It's awesome.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.060
With AI, just tell people a bit about yourself

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.060
and then we'll, I wanna talk about this journey.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.060
- It's a long story because I'm turning 50 in June, 2024.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.340
So if you listen to this before June, 2024,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.300
I will be 49, after I will be 50.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.540
So yes, that will be-

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.940
- You're a spring chicken.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.620
I'm older than you, Fred.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.260
- Oh, you're older than me.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.660
Okay, cool.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.300
I found someone older than me to talk to.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.700
Oh, that's fine.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.820
- You can still write code into your fifties.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.380
Let me tell you, the keyboard still works.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.300
It's amazing.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.260
- And I started when I was 48,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.540
but maybe we get back to this later.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.380
So originally, I mean, my professional journey

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.340
started as an interpreter, Russian, English to French.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.620
So I graduated as an interpreter, so in languages.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.780
And then I started being involved in music.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.460
I was head of sponsorship

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.500
for a big music festival in Belgium.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.020
I had rock venues, live music venues for a few years.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.100
And then I started being involved in tech

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.780
as a head of product,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.340
head of paid acquisition for a few startups.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.580
I had my own startups.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.140
I exited one startup in the FinTech space

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.940
in the early 2000s.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.300
I had a circus for two years.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.780
That's quite- - A circus?

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.660
- That's quite an interesting story.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.500
Yes, family circus with four big tents,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.820
eight tons of equipment.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.380
So that was quite a story.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.860
- Was this like Cirque du Soleil

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.980
or was it with animals or what kind of-

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.580
- It was more like, I would say like Cirque du Soleil,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.340
but at a smaller, smaller scale, of course.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.180
- Okay, amazing.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.180
- Four tents and circus artists and actors and musicians.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.460
And that was, yes, an original show, an original story.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.060
I also produced rock bands.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.420
Maybe I can give a shout out to one of the bands

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.780
that I love, that I contributed to, the Boxer Rebellion.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.060
Maybe you heard about them, the Boxer Rebellion?

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.900
- Yeah.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.500
- It's a British band based here in London,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.380
but with a singer from Nashville, Tennessee,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.220
Nathan Nicholson.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.700
So I was involved in music, in tech,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.180
I mean, in all of those things.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.860
And I think that the project that we're going to talk about

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.900
is kind of a good mix between music, tech,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.980
and all my passions.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.940
I was also a radio DJ for you, so that's why.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.860
- Yeah, that's the audio side, right?

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.180
That kind of brings you some together

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.500
in the music, I suppose, as well.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.940
- Exactly. - Amazing.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.540
You know, listening to you tell the story,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.940
first of all, wow, what a diverse set of experiences.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.460
That must have been really fun.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.100
- It's not a career, that's the problem.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.020
Unemployable.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.860
- But in terms of thinking about products and coding,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.100
I know when I experience different areas,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.380
I always see like, oh, this could be way better,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.660
and that could be way better, and why is that so hard?

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.740
Surely we could create some software to fix these things.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.420
You must have had a lot of ideas

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.260
about programs you would like to see

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.620
and stuff you'd like to work on.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.620
- Yes, yes.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.180
And multiple times, the solution for me

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.460
was to hire people to do it.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.500
So I had my own startups in the past,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.740
and I always had a team of, let's say,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.980
two to five developers working for me

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.300
when we were doing that.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.820
So I kind of understood all the structure,

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.300
the architecture of the apps.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.660
But I'd never really coded myself,

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.860
so I was always relying on other people.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.900
The difference today is that I spent

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.980
most of my days coding, which is quite different.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.220
- Yeah.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.380
Yeah, and you said you started coding when you were 48.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.700
- Yes.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.980
- Roughly almost two years ago.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.060
- Yes. - That's awesome.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.900
You know, I do hear from a lot of people,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.820
or see comments like, oh, I think I'm too old to learn this,

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.300
or, oh, you have to have done this

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.500
when you were a kid, or maybe gotten a degree in college,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.740
otherwise you're doomed.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.140
You know, you surely have an alternative viewpoint on that,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.060
given your success.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.500
- Actually, I thought it would be like that also for me,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.500
because I would say I'm quite a perfectionist.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.860
So if I learn something, I want to achieve something

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.340
with what I learn.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.140
And the problem, the issue with code for me

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.260
for a long time had been that, okay,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.420
I could go through the basic tutorials,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.540
the first lessons, you know, watching some videos,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.300
or reading some tutorials,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.420
but it was difficult for me

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.940
to really achieve something meaningful,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.460
something that I could really share

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.500
that could become a product,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.860
because you always end up doing the same little,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.020
you know, exercises and little tutorials,

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.300
and that doesn't end up anywhere.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.540
So-

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.940
- You learned how to do a loop,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.540
but then that doesn't really help you

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.380
get any closer to an app, right?

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.140
- Yeah, you learn how to do a little to-do list,

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.780
or a little calculator, or, you know, something very simple,

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.180
nothing that would be worth sharing as a product,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.500
and especially as a paid product.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.260
So I always thought, okay, if I want to build a SaaS,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.100
the only solution for me is to rely on a freelancer,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.660
or on an agency, or on a team of people.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.660
That's how I was doing it until I-

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.900
- That's a big risk, and it's,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.180
that's a big risk, and it's also not that easy

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.780
to hire a team to build your product,

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.700
when you're still trying to figure out what a product is,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.380
and all these things, right?

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.380
- Yes, and I mean, even if you hire non-expensive developers,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.980
it has still a cost, and if you want to,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.380
you know, just, if you don't want to take too much risk,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.660
if you want to test your product,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.340
to see if you have product market fits,

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.620
I mean, you don't want to spend 5,000, 10,000,

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.020
15,000 on a product.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.100
So, yeah, it's difficult, and the alternative

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.340
that people are mostly, most of the time advocating

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.940
these days, it's no code.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.220
So it's, you know, building stuff with a, let's say,

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.860
bubble, which is pretty popular, or-

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:42.740
- Got Retool, they've been a sponsor of the show before.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.500
- Retool, obviously, that's pretty nice,

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.220
mostly for internal apps.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.420
And also, you can just connect stuff through Zapier,

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.660
through Make, formerly IntegraMatte.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.020
So you can achieve something,

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.420
but you don't have the control on the UI,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.180
you don't really have the control exactly

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.900
on what's happening behind the scenes,

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.180
and you don't have the flexibility that you have

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.140
if you really code yourself.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.460
So if you can really get your hands dirty

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.540
and code on your own.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.860
So I was also, I used also to be a strong advocate

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.980
of no code, so I was using,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.100
I'm still using,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.460
firstly Zapier, and then later on Make.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:34.460
But once I discovered Python in August, September 2022,

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.420
then everything changed for me,

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.980
because then I could really start doing my own stuff.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.100
And I started with backend stuff,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.780
with backend scripts for, let's say,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.380
to create competitive intelligence scripts,

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.700
things like that.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.780
And I slowly moved into frontend,

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.780
but first for a few months,

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.580
it was mostly local scripts on my computer.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.900
- Yeah, that's really interesting.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.780
The low code, no code stuff is super powerful.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.420
And I think it does make it possible

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.860
for people to build apps.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.420
I have a friend who built a platform

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.780
a little bit on top of something

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.740
that's kind of a low code thing,

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.140
and what they're doing is really impressive.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.260
And they've got lots of customers,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.380
and it's going really well.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.300
It's a vibrant business,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.860
but it's always your beholden

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.540
to whatever that platform does.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.540
If the platform has downtime, you have downtime.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.620
If they're changing their feature set

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.900
in a way that doesn't quite line up

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.300
with what you're trying to do,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.980
well, that's too bad,

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.860
because they've changed their direction or whatever.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.100
And it's really powerful,

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.140
but it's also a little bit of a risk, right?

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.700
To be built on top of that.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.460
- A risk, yes, but for me, it was even more,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.340
I would say the arbitrage was even more about flexibility.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.940
So when you code something on your own

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.460
with Python, JavaScript, as I'm doing now,

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.380
it's faster in many cases than trying to figure out

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.180
how to connect, let's say, Airtable with something else.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.540
Then you've got to think about

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.540
how the data is structured in Airtable,

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.620
how the data has to be structured on the other side,

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.140
and then how to connect them together.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:37.180
Sometimes it's easier if you just have a SQLite database

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.660
or MySQL database,

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.580
and then if you do your own stuff on your own

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.580
without trying to connect existing SaaS together.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:53.060
So it was more about flexibility for me,

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.780
the main reason why I switched almost completely

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.100
from no-code to coding.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.020
- That's really interesting.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.100
I guess one more that would be worth considering is price.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.300
Some of these low-code, no-code platforms

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.060
are really powerful, but when you start to look at price

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.020
for a decent number of users using your app,

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.780
a lot of them are built for internal use cases

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.820
and are not really built for having a bunch

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.180
of multi-tenant style users and so on,

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.020
but also they can just get real expensive real quick.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.460
- Yes, because they are based usually on the amount

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.460
of transactions or scenarios or zaps that can run.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:39.500
So if you want to transfer one piece of data

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.620
from one software to another one, it's one transaction.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:47.620
So if you have, let's say, 10,000 transactions per month

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.660
for a certain price,

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.780
then yeah, you can run out of transactions pretty quickly.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.260
- Yeah.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.260
- It's very quickly, you end up paying 25, 30, $40

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.540
for a pretty low amount of transactions,

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.060
of API codes basically between the difference.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.580
- Yeah, and if you glue them together,

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:18.940
in one tool connects to another, which connects to another,

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.140
then you've got to pay for kind of the traffic

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.500
and the activity in all three.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.540
It's not just like, well, I'm talking to my database.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.820
I'm now talking to some other service

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.100
that's got something going on.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.140
- Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:37.260
And the fact is also that there are a few tools

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.340
that enable you to create a UI user interface

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.260
for your product, but you're limited

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.140
to the building blocks usually that they offer,

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.380
even if you can tweak them with some code.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.460
And it's a bit the same, I would say,

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.820
it's a bit also the same issue that I've experienced

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.220
on WordPress, let's say.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.780
The problem is that if you use something like Bubble

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.940
and you want to build something with it,

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:09.380
you bring to your app or the mothership,

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:14.380
the core of the big app, let's say, of Bubble as a whole,

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.580
when you want to build something on top

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.100
of a platform like that.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:24.180
So it's a lot of things that you don't really need

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.180
for your specific apps, but that have to be there

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.380
because the old engine has to run.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.620
- Yeah, that's a good point.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.980
- Usually what you also experience with WordPress,

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.820
for instance, when you have a site on WordPress,

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.860
maybe sometimes, or even most of the time,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.380
you don't need that big engine.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.900
You could work with a static website

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.380
with a few HTML, CSS, JavaScript pages.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.060
That would be much lighter.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:55.060
That would be less code to activate

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:59.420
to have your website up and running.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:04.420
So yeah, it's also, in terms of performance,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.820
if you can code your own stuff,

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.460
I think it's also a good reason to choose

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.580
coding versus no code, if you can do it.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.420
- Totally agree.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.460
- So price, performance, control, all those things.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.460
That said, you do have to understand more about the world.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.060
All right, like one thing we were coordinating around

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.420
is just like understanding web app architecture.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.900
I don't know how you feel about it,

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.740
but I feel like a lot of the guidance that is out there

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.060
is too intense.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.860
There's too many moving parts, right?

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.660
Like everyone thinks you need to have

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.260
some kind of background worker service like Celery,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.060
and you need a caching layer,

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.860
and you need this, and you need that.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.820
And it just starts to be like,

00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:00.100
whoa, this is like running Netflix.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:00.940
You know what I mean?

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.500
Whereas a lot of times what you need is a backend,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.500
a front end, and some kind of data store, and that's it.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.780
And that data store, you mentioned it before,

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.460
the data store can be, in the early days,

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.500
it could be SQLite, which doesn't require another server

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.700
or another thing to maintain and connect and secure.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.020
And it can just be a file that you back up.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.180
- Yeah, exactly.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.820
- While you're proving out the idea, right?

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.460
So maybe, you're coming from a place

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.820
where you weren't a DevOps expert.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.980
How'd this transition go for you?

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:40.740
- So when I started developing an app

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:47.140
for some reason, I came across Flask

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.380
as a solution for Python.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:55.380
So I started developing the app on Flask.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:01.700
What I like about Flask is that if you compare it,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.140
let's say you use Flask,

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.260
and then for the pages, you use HTML, CSS,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.780
and Vanilla JavaScript.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.860
What I like is that you can deploy an app

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.700
which comes from a single folder,

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:20.460
and you've got everything there, your main Flask file,

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.180
and then all the, let's say the sub files in Python

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.660
with all the business logic that you can isolate

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.180
in one file or another.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.300
But it's one project, and then you deploy the project

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.540
to GitHub, and then let's say you connect GitHub to Railway.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.340
I'm using Railway for my deployment.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.620
So you connect GitHub to Railway,

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:46.620
and then once you update your code in PyCharm

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.100
or in Visual Studio,

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.100
then you have the automatic deployment to Railway.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.860
But it's one project.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.500
Whereas if you want to decouple completely

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.900
the backend from the frontend,

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.340
let's say you work with something like Next.js, for instance,

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.380
and then you want to have a backend in something else,

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.580
then you've got to have multiple instances

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.620
and connect them together.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.260
It becomes more complicated.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.380
But if you want to create something simple,

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:23.100
you can keep it simple with one single Flask web app.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.380
And that's what I've been doing so far.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:32.100
Most of the jingle maker that I built,

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.700
that I've been building since September 23,

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.380
is a Flask web app.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.020
So it's one project, one big project,

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.780
but it's one project.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.780
And it's interesting that you mentioned Sillery

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.900
a few moments ago,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.460
because I'm about to ship a new app,

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.900
which is coming in the next two weeks or three weeks, I think.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.180
And that's the first time after, yeah,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.980
almost 18 months of development

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.500
that I've considered using something like that

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.780
because I needed it for performance reasons to process.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.740
- Something you want to start off in the background

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.940
and get back and just let it be done later, right?

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.780
- Yeah.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.580
And it was not that easy.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:28.420
We had a discussion with someone who is amazing

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.860
on the Discord of Railway two, three days ago.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.340
Because, I mean,

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.500
if you're deploying things on Railway,

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.580
you would usually use,

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:47.100
that's what they advise you to do as on Heroku,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.700
a proc file, and the proc file,

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.340
you've got the start commands

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.700
that will start your project.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.900
But on Heroku, which is a competitor of Railway,

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.700
you can start both the web app

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.140
and the worker in the same file.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.580
But you can't do that on Railway.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.860
You've got theoretically two different projects,

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.620
which kind of defeats the purpose.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.300
- You've got to deploy them both, right?

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.220
But then you get some more coordination.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.060
- Yes, yeah.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.180
But fortunately, and there is a discussion

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.380
on the Discord between me and one of the guys there,

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.460
they had a way to create a custom JSON for me,

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:37.060
which managed to start both the web app

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.420
and the worker in the same deployment.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.380
But I had to fight, to be honest with you,

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.860
for like four or five hours to find a solution.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.700
- Yeah.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.700
- Sometimes the problem,

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.820
and that's the issue that I've seen a lot,

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.860
is that traditional developers,

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.260
like professional developers, not people like me,

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.060
not random guys like me,

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.380
usually they assume that the people

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.980
that they're supposed to explain things to

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.340
know much more than what they do.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.780
And so they just write a few instructions,

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:18.260
like cryptic instructions that nobody really understands.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.500
And they would assume

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.100
that everyone reading those instructions

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.940
would understand what they have to do

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.860
to, let's say, use this worker service, for instance.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.700
- Yeah.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.540
- But that's not the case.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.380
- I totally agree.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.540
I totally agree.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.420
It's kind of the curse of knowledge.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.340
Like once you know all of these things,

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.300
it's really hard to remember, "Oh yeah."

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.700
So then you just, "Oh, just run that in Docker."

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.980
And then link it and set up a network over there.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.100
You're like, "Wait a minute.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.620
I don't know how to do that.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.140
I'm just trying to run my Python app."

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.140
You're bringing a whole new thing in

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.140
that you think makes it sound easy.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.020
And it makes it sound real hard to me.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.740
- Yeah.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.580
- I totally disagree.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.420
- There are so many moving pieces.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.340
So many moving pieces.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.020
When you start coding,

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.020
I mean, obviously you know that

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:09.540
because you've been in this game for much longer than me.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.460
But once you start coding,

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.980
there are so many little things

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.380
that you have to know to make this thing work.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:20.380
So it starts with how to just configure GitHub

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.940
and connect it to your-

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.660
- How do you use Git?

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.500
- Yeah, I just-

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.780
- If you have a Git conflict,

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.140
you might be like, "Well, this is done.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.420
I can't do anything else anymore.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.940
It's broken."

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.780
- Yeah.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.380
- I mean, it's really overwhelming when you're new, right?

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.420
- There's a lot.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.020
And that's where AI today helps you.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.540
Because in most cases,

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.420
if you know how to talk with the AI,

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:50.220
you will get answers that are much easier to understand

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.540
than what you would have on Stack Overflow, for instance.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.380
- Yes.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.260
I agree.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.180
It's very interesting how helpful it is.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.780
I think it's a good time to about jump into that.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:00.620
But before we do,

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.260
tell people about Railway a bit.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.100
How does this work?

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.980
I haven't used Railways before.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:11.420
- So it's a platform where you can deploy your apps,

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.220
basically.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:18.220
It connects to your GitHub account.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:23.580
And it's not only,

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.300
I mean, you have on Railway,

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.300
not only a possibility to deploy your Flask app

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.460
or other types of apps also,

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.940
but they also offer all the database aspect.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.940
So you can spin a Redis database,

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.260
you can have a MySQL database.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.860
I think they also have Mongo.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:51.300
I mean, they have most of the formats that you can expect.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.100
And the great thing is that everything is

00:22:54.100 --> 00:23:00.580
on the same platform.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.700
Let's say that I've got another project

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.620
I'm involved with a developer,

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.980
with a real developer,

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.340
hi to Alex, if he listens to this podcast,

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.420
a professional developer.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:16.340
And for that project, for instance,

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.620
we have an app on Heroku.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.980
We have a database on MongoDB Atlas.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.500
And we have the files,

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:33.740
so uploaded to S3, to Amazon S3 for the file storage.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.740
On Railway, you can, at least it's what I do,

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.700
you can have at the same time,

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.900
the deployment of the app.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.100
So which replaces Heroku

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:47.260
and you can have the database also together.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.060
And the cool thing is that they are,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:55.660
I would say even physically at the same location.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:00.700
So in terms of performance, it's pretty easy to handle.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.460
And it's very user-friendly.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.940
I mean, very, very easy to use.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.020
From what I saw, even easier to understand

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.420
than Heroku.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.460
And I tried also some things like Versal

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:21.460
or I use for some project also,

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.620
but that's more for static website, Netlify.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.460
But for this type-

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.420
- Netlify is fantastic for static, but yeah.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.220
- For static, Netlify is just amazing.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.260
And just the one where you can just drag and drop a project,

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.060
for instance, for a static website, so easy.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.060
But for a more multi-tenant dynamic web app

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.700
like the Jingle Maker, Railway was really cool.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.540
- Yeah.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.060
- And as you can see from the presentation,

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.500
it's very user-friendly.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.540
- Yeah, it definitely is.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.460
And the pricing is actually really decent.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.100
They have a free trial and then $5 a month,

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.700
but that gives you eight gigs of RAM

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.700
and eight CPUs per service.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.740
That is really good.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.700
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.300
I started it on the OBI plan.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:10.740
And I think that today, just to give you an idea,

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:15.740
with roughly 500 users coming to the app per day

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:21.540
and a lot of them using the product,

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:25.180
I pay for that roughly $15 a month

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:32.420
for both the app deployment and the database,

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.300
which is in MySQL for the Jingle Maker.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.660
- That's pretty impressive.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.700
Okay, good one to know about.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.620
This is cool.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.460
- Yeah, it's nice.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.060
- And they have good Python support, I'm assuming.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:45.940
- Sorry?

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.100
- They have good Python support?

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.220
- Yes, yes, very good.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.740
And they have, as I said, like most people do today,

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:57.740
a Discord server, which is monitored also by volunteers.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.580
And there was a guy the other day,

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.980
I didn't even know he was not part

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.300
of the official team of Railway,

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.380
and it really helped me.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.020
He wrote some code for me to make this thing work

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.100
with Celery.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.220
So it was really, really amazing.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.940
And it was on a Sunday in the evening.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.660
So really nice.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.220
- Amazing, yeah, that's amazing.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.620
One thing I just want to give a shout out to

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.380
that I came across recently that's interesting

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.980
is Coolify.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.820
- Coolify.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.500
- Which is, it's self-hosted Heroku Netlify

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.980
Vercel alternative.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.420
You just get pushed to it.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.740
I don't know if it's better than this though,

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.700
because you got to have a decent server to run it on,

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.500
you got to run the Docker stuff and whatnot to sort of do it.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.940
But yeah, anyway, speaking of--

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.780
- And you've got to manage also,

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:49.220
because the other day, I think it was 10 days ago,

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.380
there was a DDoS attack, I think,

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:56.380
against Railway for the European part of their network.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.940
But they were very quick at jumping on it

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.940
and managing all of that,

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:05.140
and doing all the mitigation against it.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.940
If you run your own service,

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.980
then you've got to take care of all of that.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:09.820
- Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.300
- Your own security and all of that, so yeah.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.140
- There's benefits, but there's also drawbacks there.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.980
All right, let's talk about,

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.260
I think the right way to start talking about

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:24.260
this, how you're using AI and the journey you went through.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.020
I mean, we've talked a lot about foundations already,

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.020
but let's talk about your app.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.940
You've mentioned a couple of times, AI Jingle Maker.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.300
- Yes.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.660
- So this is, tell people what it does.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:41.900
- So it's a web app that you can find on AIJingleMaker.com.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.780
And if you enter the app,

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.180
you can create your own sweepers, radio jingles,

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.580
podcast intros, audio promos,

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.340
as if you were playing with Lego bricks, I would say.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.900
It's not the usual

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:04.100
dough experience.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:08.260
Like if you, I mean, if you'll be using things

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:13.060
like GarageBand or FL Studio or Pro Tools

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.060
to edit your audio,

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.540
you can imagine those waves that you've got to move around

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.380
to create your jingles or your sweepers.

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.780
If you're using, for instance,

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.460
the open source Audacity software also on your computer,

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.620
you can do that.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.660
But still, you've got to know how to move these things

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.180
around and how to play with the volume,

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.620
the fade in, the fade out, the reverb,

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.380
the chorus, the flanger, I mean, all the effects.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.900
And I mean, it's not that easy for many people.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.820
And so I thought that I could build something

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.380
that made it as easy as pressing on a few buttons.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.700
So that's the idea of the product.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.340
So the way you use it,

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.940
when you enter the product,

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.580
you've got four different parts.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.300
You've got the intro, the background, the outro,

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.060
and the voiceover, which is on top of the background.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.620
And the voiceover, now you've got three different options.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.140
You've got the possibility to record your own voice.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.940
So I rebuilt a voice recorder,

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:26.700
an online voice recorder where you can quickly record

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.860
your voice, add a few effects,

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.340
and then boom, use that as your voiceover.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.860
You can also upload an existing recording

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.820
that you have on your computer.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.700
So if you've got something that you recorded

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.060
with FL Studio or something else,

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.980
you can upload it and use it as a voiceover.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.380
Or you can use AI.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:50.380
So I'm connected to a bunch of text-to-speech API.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.620
So I didn't develop the models myself.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.500
I'm not someone smart enough to develop

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:00.380
a foundational model, but I'm connected to the APIs.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.340
And you can pick one of the voices.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:10.260
You can then write your text, generate the voiceover.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.580
And once you have the voiceover, you just select it.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.100
And when you have the voiceover,

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.500
you choose a background behind it.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.820
So let's say groovy music, house music, rock music,

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.060
romantic music, whatever.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.660
You've got some pre-made sounds in the app.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.860
You choose an intro, an outro,

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.980
and then you press on Generate Jingle.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.740
And in five seconds, you've got a jingle.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.460
That's basically the idea.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.860
- Yeah, let's see if this will come through in the recording.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:40.820
I'll see.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.660
Here, tell me if you hear this, Fred.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.700
- Oh, I don't hear it.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.940
That's always the problem.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.940
That's always the problem with technology

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.740
and especially with screen sharing,

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.380
is that sometimes the tabs don't work.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.540
But you've got to imagine the song.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.380
But it was trying to-

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.220
- You know what?

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.340
I'll tell you what, Fred.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.660
I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna put in,

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.020
I'll put in the jingle so people know

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.260
exactly what this sounds.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.020
I'll put it in right now.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.140
And we can listen to it.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.940
And then people will know exactly

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.060
what we're talking about here.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.660
So, you know, it's really cool.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:20.100
And it's something that I've seen people hire

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.220
voiceover actors on like Fiverr and stuff like that.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.980
They'll maybe pay 30 bucks to have somebody

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.020
do a couple of trials and throw some music on top of,

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.460
or something like that, right?

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.540
- And I'm a voiceover artist on Fiverr.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.020
I'm doing that also.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:35.860
- Okay.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.620
So you're like, let me see if I can get,

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.820
let me see if I can automate my job away.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.660
- Yeah.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.020
I mean, it was not really the idea of automating

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.860
completing the job.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.300
It was more like the, you know,

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.580
how can you create something that's self-service

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:57.580
and that can meet the needs of people, as you said,

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:01.700
who don't want to spend 50 bucks or 100 bucks

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.740
for something.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:07.740
But want to have an easy way to create basic sweepers,

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.660
jingles, or some other things.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:15.660
And the first target was mostly indie radio stations

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.820
or small podcasts.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:23.260
But then I saw many brands coming.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.700
Like, I wouldn't say like, not the big brands,

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:31.020
but small brands coming like apparel brands or coffee shops.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:36.020
Or I had the other day a bar in Ibiza signing up

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.660
and paying for credits to generate a promo

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.660
for the bar in Ibiza.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.820
So yeah, it's not only radio stations and podcasts.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:50.820
It's also anyone who wants to create a promo

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.300
for their business.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.420
So that's also one of the services.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:59.100
And when I started, it was only short sweepers,

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.980
jingles, radio station.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.220
I did stuff like that.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.420
But then I added something which is called the promo maker,

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.740
which you have in the jingle maker,

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.020
where you can create something

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.020
which is up to 30 seconds long.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.340
So more like a radio ad.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.780
So that's another.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.900
And there you can also use AI.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.940
It's connected to open AI, to be honest,

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:22.460
but you can also use AI to generate the text of your promo.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.020
So just put the name of your business,

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.340
what you're selling, your service, your product.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.180
- Amazing.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.220
- Then it will suggest the text.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.860
Then you choose the voice.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.620
You generate the AI voice,

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.540
and then you add the sounds, and then it's finished.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.540
So let's say in 20 seconds, you've got a node you add.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:44.540
So that's the promise for the promo maker.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.820
- It's a cool app, and it's really impressive

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:51.780
to look at this and think that you built this

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.460
with less than a year of Python,

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.220
or really any coding experience, right?

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:58.780
Roughly that amount?

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.140
- To put things really in perspective

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.740
so that people know what they can expect

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.740
if they start their coding journey.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:12.740
So I started coding in Python in September, October 2022.

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:16.700
For a few months, as I said,

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.300
I was mostly coding scripts on my computer

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.660
that helped me in my daily business,

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.460
because I didn't tell you in the beginning,

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.060
but most of my activity, it's online marketing.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.140
It's working for startups and bigger companies also.

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.860
So I need scripts for competitive intelligence,

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.140
for SEO, or for even content production,

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:38.980
this type of thing.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.660
So I created a lot of scripts locally on my computer

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:46.580
before considering the front end part.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.860
Then that's when I discovered Flask.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.460
That was just before the summer of 2023.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.180
And yes, the first version of the Jingle Maker

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.340
that I launched, it was just on the home page.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.780
You couldn't basically, you couldn't tweak anything.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.780
There were just four different jingles

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.500
and just put the name of your radio station.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.020
You press on generate and it generated one thing,

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.260
the same for everyone.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.140
And it started getting some traction

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.660
between May 2023 and August.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.340
And then I said, okay,

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.380
I'm gonna really dive into this project

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:28.300
and develop something more sophisticated.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.300
And I started working on that on a Monday in September.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:38.260
It was released on the Friday.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.900
- Awesome. - The V2.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.740
So-

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:47.540
- And I gotta tell you, your website now looks really nice.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.020
You've done a lot of good design work on it as well

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.540
in the last couple of months.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.100
- Yeah, it has evolved because maybe you saw it

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.340
for the first time when we decided to do this podcast.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:00.300
It was a white page.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.940
The logo was the same, but it was different.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.300
Originally, it was only in material design.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.300
So I was using material design via the CDN from Google.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:15.580
But then I wanted to use Tailwind.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.380
And so the new version that you see is using Tailwind.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:24.380
So people might recognize the Tailwind vibe.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.100
And I worked quite a lot on this thing that,

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.700
okay, we said it's audio, so people don't see it.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.540
But if you go on the website, you would see it.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:35.540
There is this rotating list of things

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:40.300
that you can create with the product.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.340
It was inspired by some code that I found,

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.180
but I had to retweak it for,

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.940
make it responsive and all of that.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.740
So yeah, that's...

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.260
And you know, also a big shout out to my son,

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.100
who is 18 and was learning Python a lot.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.140
He coded a few things recently.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.380
He's coding something to play darts at the moment,

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.540
like to calculate the scores in darts.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.300
And two months ago, he said to me that,

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.140
"Your site is nice, but it looks ugly.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:13.020
So could you make something that looks better?"

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.180
I said, "Yeah, yeah."

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.700
But you know, I kind of like it.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.180
I said, "No, no, no, no, no, no that.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.500
It's not the way it should be.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.820
So do something better.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.660
I know you can do it."

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.380
So that's why also we've got something

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.220
which looks better today, thanks to my son, Maxim.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.860
- Wow, it's a huge improvement from where it started.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.660
So nice work on that.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.500
- Yeah.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.980
- All right, let's talk about some of the techniques

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.740
that you used here to...

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:46.420
First of all, what LLM did you use to go on this journey?

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.980
- So when I started,

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.220
I wasn't even aware of GitHub Copilot.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.580
So I started only with ChatGPT.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:01.140
So I was an early premium user of ChatGPT.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.300
So I started paying the 20 bucks very early for GPT+.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:09.580
So yeah, so I started using ChatGPT.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:14.340
So basically switching between the ChatGPT UI

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:19.460
and the IDE, I started using PyCharm.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.820
So that's the first one I used.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.940
So I was creating some code in ChatGPT

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:29.660
and then jumping to PyCharm, test the code.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:31.860
And then if there was a bug, coming back to ChatGPT.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.980
So this back and forth journey.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.980
And then I subscribed to--

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.620
- You asked it at the beginning.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.700
How do I make a Flask app?

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.420
What did you ask it in the beginning?

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.660
Like, how do I make a Flask app?

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:50.260
How do I make a Flask app that does audio?

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.820
Like, what did you--

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.460
- Yeah, that's a very good question.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:58.300
So I knew that I wanted to use Flask.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.060
So the first thing that you would ask

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:05.020
is to ask ChatGPT for a boilerplate of a Flask web app.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.940
And it will give you pretty quickly

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:13.260
the basic building blocks.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.740
I don't know if it would give you straight away

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:20.060
the architecture with a template

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.300
inside of the template folder, but no, it gives you--

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.460
- Hello world as a string.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.140
- Yeah, hello world on the page.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.940
But then if you know that you need HTML,

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.620
then you will ask ChatGPT to tweak it

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:40.180
to render index.html from the template folder.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.780
And there you see, there it starts.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:47.580
Yeah, and it gives you some boilerplate for the HTML

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.860
that you put in the templates folder.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.500
And then you learn that you need,

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:58.220
ideally, to have some JavaScript in a JavaScript file

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.700
and that you need some CSS in a CSS file

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.860
and that those two files will be in the static folder

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.420
of a Flask web app.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.300
So now I've got, let's say my routine,

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.260
I've got all of that ready.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:16.740
And if I start a new app, I don't even need,

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.020
obviously, a ChatGPT.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:19.260
I just create my structure.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:23.660
I put index.html, script.js, styles.css.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:29.940
But then what you can also ask ChatGPT to do, for instance,

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:33.980
is if you've got your HTML page,

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.980
you can say, "Restyle this HTML page

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.780
"with Tailwind CSS using the CDN," for instance,

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.060
and it will give you a full restyling.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.220
And then you can ask it,

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.140
"Okay, I want on this page four buttons,

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.740
"and those four buttons should do X, Y, Z."

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:57.180
And then you start moving into the JavaScript part of it

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:02.660
for the interactions on the page.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.820
The interesting thing maybe,

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:08.740
which would explain also why I haven't really started

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:12.820
using Next.js or Vue or things like that,

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.300
is that by default, for some reason,

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.980
you've got to ask OpenAI why,

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.700
maybe because of some legacy importance

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:22.980
of Vania JavaScript.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:27.980
But if you ask ChatGPT to start creating some interactions

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:31.780
on an HTML page, it won't just tell you,

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:36.460
"Okay, these days people use React or Next.js

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.500
"or something like that,

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.260
"so maybe you should consider that."

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.580
It will go deep into Vania JavaScript.

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:48.460
And after developing the Jingle Maker for a few months,

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.540
I showed it to my friend Alex,

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.660
who is this developer I was talking about earlier,

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.820
who has graduated, I would say,

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.580
from Vania JavaScript to React.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.700
And he looked at my code and said,

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.060
"Man, that's crazy.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.060
"It's all Vania JavaScript.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.220
"There's not a single line of React.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.580
"So everything in your app,

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.780
"it's lines and lines and lines of JavaScript."

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.860
And he said--

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.260
- That's a benefit and a drawback.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.340
- Yeah, but he said that he would not even be able

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.740
to write it this way from scratch today.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:28.220
That's not something that he would really consider doing

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.180
because it's more verbose,

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.900
there's more stuff to write

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.740
to achieve what you want to achieve.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.660
But the thing is that with chatGPT,

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:42.660
or today with a GitHub copilot embedded in the IDE,

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:46.980
even if it's longer, that's not a problem

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.500
because you don't write a single line of code.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:53.740
I mean, I think it's important to point that out,

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.900
is that in the Jingle Maker,

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:02.540
there is not one single line of code that I wrote, not one.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.020
- That's insane.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:08.780
- There's not one, not a single line of code that I typed

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:13.420
from the first curly bracket to the last curly bracket.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.220
Nothing, everything is written like that.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.380
Yesterday, for instance, I was working

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.540
on something completely different now

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.460
for a friend who is also a client

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.060
who are working on a Gmail add-on.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.060
So I don't know if you're familiar with that,

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.220
but you're using Apps Script from Google

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.820
and then create a manifest and blah, blah.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.860
And I didn't know anything about Gmail add-ons

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.580
until yesterday in the morning.

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:47.180
And after now five hours of work,

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.780
we've got a fully working product in Gmail.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.540
- That's amazing.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.140
- Yeah, that's great, that's great, 2024.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.660
And it's only the beginning,

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:04.540
because I really see that evolving super fast.

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.540
I think that now the most important thing

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.500
is to be able to talk to the machine,

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.700
to explain the structure,

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.780
the architecture of what you expect,

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:20.780
and to be clear in your head about how the code

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:27.540
has to be developed for the pages to interact,

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.820
for the elements to interact together.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.740
And if it's clear in your head,

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:35.500
and if you can explain it clearly to your computer,

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:40.500
to the LLM, it's just like magic.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.820
- It is like magic.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.620
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty wild.

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.420
So you can see on the side here,

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.940
I have these really weird recent chats I had,

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.180
like a skilled baker Q&A

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.140
and survive a plane crash in the wilderness.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:58.700
And so these things are actually related.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.180
And what I was trying to do

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.900
was I was trying to understand how much prompt engineering

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.500
and sort of setting the stage for the questions matters.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:12.740
So like this one, I said, you are a very skilled baker.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.460
You have run a successful restaurant

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:15.660
in the city for five years.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.580
Now I will ask you questions,

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.980
as opposed to this one,

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.620
you are a very skilled outdoorsman,

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.780
and you've been on multiple reality shows.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:27.900
Now I'll ask you some questions.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.780
And they were both the same question.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.540
If I'm in a plane crash and I need to survive,

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:37.540
I wanted to see how much the baker would focus on food

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:40.060
and stuff versus the survivalist on others.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:44.180
And I feel like that's a real clear way to understand

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.740
this kind of stuff in just a real general way.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:52.740
But I think there must be a code aspect of that as well.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.380
Like rather than just tell me how to do this in Python,

00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:00.180
like you have written this app in Python,

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.820
or you're an expert on FastAPI.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.420
Now I want to talk to you.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.260
You may get different results,

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:06.820
maybe better, maybe worse, I don't know.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.460
But did you try any of this techniques

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.220
or was it just straight down the middle?

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.060
Tell me how to do this with tail end.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.900
- To be fair with you,

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.900
because I was a total newbie in the beginning,

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:24.900
I was making sure to ask the DI to explain to me

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.940
almost as if I were five year old.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:34.380
Because I could have told the AI,

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.780
you're an expert Python developer,

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.660
and then just give me the code.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.260
But then I don't have all the explanations

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:48.060
because then it behaves like an expert Python developer.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:52.100
And there are many shortcuts that it will take

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.180
and not really give you all the details,

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.380
documenting all the code.

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.900
So I'm still,

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:02.420
yeah, more like in a,

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.380
explain to me in layman's terms,

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.900
you know, how to do this.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:10.220
Because then also I understand the code.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:12.860
So it's easier for me to debug it.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:14.620
I usually take the analogy that,

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:19.940
and when you said that sometimes you think

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.460
it might be too late to learn to code

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:23.220
or to learn to do something.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.940
Let's say that you want to learn to play music,

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.100
to play the piano.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.860
At a certain age, it becomes very difficult

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.740
because you don't have the reflex, the muscles,

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.420
you know, agility that you can have

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.260
when you are a young kid to learn how to play the piano.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.220
But still, I mean, you could understand

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:46.020
what's on the score written on the page from the music.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.300
So in coding for me, it's kind of the same.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.660
I would, to be honest with you,

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.380
I would not be able to write most of the code

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:58.380
that is in my app myself, but I can read the score

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:01.220
and I can see the connections

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:05.100
between the different building blocks in the code.

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.980
So I can understand if there's a problem,

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.460
you know, a syntax issue,

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.900
because there's some, you know,

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.340
closing brackets that are not properly closed.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.020
I can see it.

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:20.020
I can, but I wouldn't be able to write the code properly

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.740
in the first place myself.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.540
And you could argue it's a problem,

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.020
but I say, you know, for me,

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:31.180
the output is what matters.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:34.740
It's the final product, which is what matters.

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.300
So as long as I understand what's on the screen,

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.020
for me, it's okay.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.060
- Yeah, well, let's loop it back

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:43.700
to the original way we started this.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:47.100
One way you could do this is you could hire people

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.860
to build this for you, and then they give you the code

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.860
and you're in the same position.

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.540
Like here's a huge pile of code

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.260
and you probably understand it.

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:56.580
I'm sure you understand it less well

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.620
than if you went through step by step.

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.060
I'm 100% sure.

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:02.060
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.900
I mean, I was in that position a few times

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:08.180
where I was involved in some projects

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:12.260
and I was not involved in the actual coding of the project.

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.340
And then I inherited the project.

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.780
I mean, I had the code base, but I could,

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.380
I mean, I could just put it on a shelf

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:23.660
because I wouldn't be able to do anything with that.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:27.140
Whereas now I understand every single section

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.820
of what's written in the app.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:34.740
So at the moment I'm repurposing some of the payment logic

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.980
because I will switch from Stripe to Paddle

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:39.300
in the Agile Maker.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:44.260
And yeah, so I've got to rebuild the payment models.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.940
I've got to rebuild the Flask routes

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.580
for the API endpoints,

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.620
for the payment confirmations and all of that.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.260
So I know where they are and I know what they do.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.940
So I know how to tweak them

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.420
and I can highlight exactly what I want.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:01.980
And then now I'm using,

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:06.260
I would say 75% of the time

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.220
I'm using GitHub Copilot straight in the IDE directly

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.780
because it's in context then.

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:14.020
You highlight the code and you,

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.060
and then if the suggestion is nice,

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:20.300
you just insert it to replace the code.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:23.300
So that's, so yeah, once you've got something

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:28.660
that you understand, it goes faster and faster.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.940
So yeah.

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.860
- Yeah, and you're still early in this project, right?

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.300
This is- - Yeah, super early.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.140
- Like six months or something.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:40.020
But I would imagine, yes, I imagine as you do more of this,

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.940
you might not choose to write a lot of code,

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:45.820
but I bet you'll start to be able to write code,

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:47.620
kind of like language immersion.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.300
You know, if you moved to Brazil,

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.620
you would start to learn Portuguese.

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:52.900
- Yes. - Eventually,

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.700
just 'cause you're in that environment so much, you know?

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.620
- But sometimes really, you know, with the suggestions,

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:04.460
it's, you wouldn't see why you would write the code.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:12.660
For instance, I had, earlier today,

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:16.260
I was creating a scraper to check the technology

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.900
used by different websites by looking in the source code

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:22.100
for, let's say, WP for WordPress,

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.180
Odoo for Odoo, Squarespace, Weebly,

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.980
you know, this kind of thing.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:30.980
So we just wrote together with the AI the first part,

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.580
and then we had to replicate the code

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.740
in beautiful soup for the scraper,

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:38.820
for each of them.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.460
There's absolutely no reason

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:44.540
why I would write each iteration.

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.700
And once you write two of them,

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.740
then you, with Copilot,

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:55.220
you just go with your tab to the next section,

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:57.300
and it will understand that what you expect,

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.060
because you've got like three or four different technologies

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.860
that you want to track in your code

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:03.100
that you declared before,

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.940
they will have to write a block of six lines.

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.420
Boom, that's the block of six lines.

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.260
There's no reason in the world

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.500
why I would write those six lines, you know?

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.580
- Yeah, amazing.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.980
- Yeah, that's great.

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:18.980
- One more prompt in engineering thing,

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.660
you talked about it, and I think it is a problem.

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:25.420
So I asked basically, what's the boilerplate?

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.980
And it said, boom, here's the boilerplate for Flask

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:28.860
in ChatGPT.

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:30.540
Then I said, well, how do I use a template?

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:33.180
And it said, boom, here's the two pieces of code.

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:36.660
You said sometimes this can be really challenging.

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.460
You said one of the techniques used

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.580
was to explain to me like a five-year-old.

00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:43.060
Another thing that works really well is I just said,

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:46.220
tell me this again, let's think step by step.

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:49.460
And it gave me a 10-step process.

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:52.820
Start one, install Flask, create a project directory,

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.740
create the project script, import Flask.

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.900
And it was really much more like,

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.100
this is what each step you need to do.

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.700
And things like that are really neat.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.500
- When you really start learning,

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:09.180
it's nice to do it step by step.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:11.620
Because some people, they don't understand,

00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:13.340
and that's quite normal.

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:17.300
I would say that you've got to install those libraries

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:18.620
before using them.

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:23.260
Simple things like that.

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.220
So in the beginning, it's nice to go step by step.

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:30.180
- Yeah, it's really powerful.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.780
And it's something people can check out.

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:36.540
There's a cool video, that's your channel, this one.

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.380
That's the one I was looking for.

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:40.180
Called "Prompt Engineering 101" by Patrick LeVere.

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:43.940
And yeah, it's like a 14-minute video, it talks through,

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:47.060
has a bunch of advice from places like Anthropic and others.

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.640
And like, here is how you go and some things you can try.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.740
Yeah.

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:58.740
- And I would also add that it's also evolving.

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:04.380
Thanks also to the longer context windows

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.460
that we have today in DLLM.

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:11.460
Because when I started doing that in 2022,

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:15.900
the context window was maximum 4,000 tokens

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:17.180
or something like that.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:20.580
So you had to really go by short section.

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:24.300
And it was very difficult to debug long pieces of code,

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.580
long sections of code.

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:30.580
Now the token window is 128,000 on OpenAI,

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:36.140
and it's even longer on Cloud or other LLMs.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:41.140
And yeah, so today it's possible to basically throw

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:48.500
at some point 750 lines of code in,

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.140
or 1,000 lines of code in DLLM,

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:55.060
and get some refactoring, debugging.

00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:59.380
So that's also really amazing.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:03.020
When you need, let's say, you know that you created

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.480
something cool in one app, some business logic,

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.540
something interesting, but you know that you want

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:10.580
to just repurpose it in a small way,

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:12.220
like make little tweaks.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:16.220
You just throw all the code into DLLM,

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:18.760
and you just explain the little changes that you want,

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:22.060
and it will give you the adapted code,

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:27.060
fully functional in one go, one shot,

00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:29.940
which is also impressive.

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.980
- That is super impressive.

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.300
So it sounds like you use Google Copilot a lot.

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:38.260
Have you looked at GPT Engineer?

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:39.860
- Nope, nope.

00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:42.580
- So I haven't really either, but it basically,

00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:45.660
it's supposed to be kind of a iterative, let's see.

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.240
Kind of an iterative thing that goes,

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:53.440
it will generate all the multiple files for you,

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:58.280
and then try to understand how all those pieces

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.560
fit together and work.

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.880
- More like an agent logic.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.920
- Yeah, exactly, exactly.

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:11.880
- No, I started working with the GPTs from OpenAI,

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.760
from chatGPT.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.080
I created a few of them.

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:19.420
There's a funny one, for instance,

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:22.660
I'm working for an accounting firm for some marketing,

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:27.620
and the boss of the company sent me a document

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:32.620
of 350 pages explaining the accounting module on Odo,

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.900
which is an ERP system, two weeks ago.

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:38.500
And he said, "Oh, you should read that

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.200
"to be able to understand it and answer questions

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.040
"about the module."

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.960
And I just threw it into chatGPT,

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:47.980
uploaded the PDF, and I created a custom GPT.

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.340
So now I can ask the custom GPT questions

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.580
about the accounting module.

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:53.900
- Oh, that's insane.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.340
That's insane.

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:56.900
- Instead of reading the,

00:56:56.900 --> 00:57:00.360
and also another nice use case that I have,

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:05.060
it's nothing about coding, but sometimes you just,

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.720
you're just on YouTube and someone tells you,

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:12.240
this is the big, the five big important things

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.120
you have to know in 2024,

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.360
which would change your life forever.

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.280
So I'm tempted.

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:21.800
Maybe I will watch this video because it might be interesting

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.400
but I'm gonna say, no, it's probably not that interesting.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.840
It's probably a lot of fluff.

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:30.840
So now usually what I do is that I've got a website called,

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.520
I don't remember the name, sorry,

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:37.360
but one of the websites where you can get the transcript

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.140
of a video.

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:42.020
So I go get the transcript, throw it into chatGPT

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:45.820
and then I ask, what are the five important things

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.780
I should know that would change my life forever in 24?

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.260
And then I've got them in five seconds.

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:54.540
I don't want to, I don't need to watch a 35 minutes video.

00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.380
So that's-

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.220
- And then maybe you decide to watch it later,

00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.060
but at least now you can filter it, right?

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.060
Yeah, awesome.

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.900
What an interesting story, Fred.

00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:06.080
So let's, I think maybe we should wrap it up,

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.300
but people can check out AIjinglemaker.com.

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.740
I'll put that in the show notes.

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:14.260
There's two other things from you that are noteworthy.

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:17.780
One is you have your AI Coding Club newsletter.

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.380
You wanna tell people about that?

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.060
- Yeah, that's a newsletter I started,

00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:25.180
which is connected to some of the videos I posted on YouTube

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:28.860
where I would explain to people how to use AI

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:30.520
for coding purposes.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.020
I will start sending the newsletters soon, actually.

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:35.960
I started registering people,

00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.240
but I haven't sent the first edition yet,

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.860
but I will start very soon.

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:43.600
And I've got also a new app, as I said,

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.200
coming up probably within two weeks.

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.600
It will be called the AI Showmaker.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:52.440
So it's a way to create a podcast

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.920
or a radio show with building blocks.

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:57.720
So it's the same concept as the Jinglemaker,

00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:59.600
but for longer form.

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.720
- That sounds really interesting.

00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:02.560
- Yeah.

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:03.400
- All right, cool.

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.560
And by the way, I've been thinking a lot

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:09.020
about email and newsletters and stuff.

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:12.580
I was doing a bunch with MailChimp for many, many years,

00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:16.000
and it's just got to be super, super expensive,

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.260
and I got frustrated with them.

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:21.000
So I did a bunch of research on different platforms,

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.360
looked at buttondown.email,

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.880
and I actually chose ListMonk,

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.680
which is self-hosted and Docker-style thing.

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.040
But one of the ones that I came across at the end

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.260
is Beehive, which looks pretty interesting.

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.840
Are you happy with Beehive?

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.960
- Yes, very nice.

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.960
And it's more competing with Substack, I would say.

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.400
I think it was co-created by one of the guys

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:49.400
who co-founded Morning Brew, the newsletter Morning Brew.

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.700
So he knows what he's talking about.

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:57.280
And it's also really well-coded, really well-executed.

00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:59.280
It's a pleasure to use.

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:04.300
And you can use it for free for up to 2,500 subscribers.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.740
Yeah, that's it.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:11.860
- The pricing is way, way better

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.460
than things like MailChimp and stuff.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:19.460
- Yeah, and it's cheaper, also cheaper than Substack.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:26.060
So I don't know which cut they take from the subscription,

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.140
if you run a premium newsletter,

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.700
but it's much cheaper than Substack.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:34.700
I think Substack takes 10% from like Patreon

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.540
and other platform like that.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.580
- Nice.

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.260
All right, and then one other thing is your,

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.780
call me Fred.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.500
- Yeah, your YouTube channel, yeah.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.820
I've got some videos there.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.820
Some of the videos are explaining how to use

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.580
the Jingle Maker, the recent ones,

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.260
but also some of them are about this journey

01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.300
of how to code with AI.

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.260
There are some concrete examples also,

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:07.260
like I coded recently a Chrome extension,

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.940
a bookmarking Chrome extension, all the code.

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:14.940
The explanations is on YouTube and the code on GitHub.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.100
So I've got different projects like that.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:21.540
And yeah, I'm usually documenting what I do on YouTube.

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:23.740
- Yeah, nice that people can check that out.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.120
All right, well, I think that about does it

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.200
for the time that we got together,

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.560
but thanks for coming on and sharing your story.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.480
I think it'll inspire a lot of folks.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.320
- Thank you.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.880
I hope that everything was clear,

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.880
that I wasn't cursed to be too cryptic

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.680
like the developer that I was talking about,

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.880
but yeah, so it's really exciting.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.920
It's rejuvenating, as you could say.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.480
- It's opening up a whole world of possibilities, right?

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.960
- Yeah, I mean, I wish I would have started earlier,

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.320
to be honest, because when I see my son, he's 18,

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.320
and what he already does today with Python,

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:11.500
that's quite amazing.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.040
So when you're 18, imagine where you will be

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.880
when you will be 48 or 49.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.220
It will be like really good.

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:22.640
So yeah, that's the beauty.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.480
That's the beauty of it.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.880
So don't wait too long if you're young,

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.200
if you're listening to the podcast,

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.720
start today or yesterday, even.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.280
- Yeah, awesome.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.600
Well, totally agree.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.240
Thanks so much for being here and see you later.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.280
- Thank you so much.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.240
Bye-bye.
