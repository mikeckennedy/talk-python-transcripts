00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
>> Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.760
Hello, Avery.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.040
Welcome to the channel, soon to the podcast.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.040
>> Thanks.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.040
Glad to be here.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.200
>> Yeah, happy to have you here.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.640
So let's just go ahead and kick this off.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.280
Avery, welcome to Talk Bythenomy.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.280
>> Thanks so much.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.920
I'm so excited to be here and be part of the show.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.480
>> I'm excited to have you here as well.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.960
>> One of the things that people reach out to me often is how do you get into data science?

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.960
How do you get into programming?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.840
How do you get into Python?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.080
I've been trying, or maybe they got a degree, or they took some training program, boot camp

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.080
or something.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.600
And going from zero to one, I think, is the biggest career step you have to make.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.600
That next job and the one after that, it only gets to be smaller steps, not bigger steps.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.680
And it's really tough because that first big step, you're brand new at it.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.680
You have no experience, right?

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.280
It's your first data science job or your first programming job.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.460
And so hopefully we can give some folks out there a little bit of a hand up to help them

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.460
make that jump.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.460
>> Yeah, totally.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.080
I like to show this graphic that says it's a circle, and it's a circle of text.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.880
And it says, "I can't get a job because I don't have experience because," and then it

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.800
restarts, "I can't get a job."

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.800
And that's the tricky part.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.000
It's like, how do you get a data science job when you have no data science experience?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.240
Because to get data science experience, that seems like you have to have a job as the prerequisite

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.240
and vice versa.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.720
So it is very tricky.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.360
So happy to chime in on that today.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.360
>> Awesome.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.560
Yeah, the industry can take it too far.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.580
They can take it way too far.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.520
So a few years ago, there was a really funny tweet that went around.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.800
Back when they call them tweets, I don't know what they're called anymore.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.160
Sebastian Ramirez, the guy who created FastAPI, saw a job posting.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.760
When FastAPI was like a year and a half old, it said, "You must have four years of experience

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.520
with FastAPI to apply."

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.240
He said, "Hey, look, I'm the creator of FastAPI, and I'm unqualified for this job.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.240
What kind of world are we living in?"

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240
>> Yeah.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.160
I don't want to live in that world, but that's unfortunately where we're at.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.440
That's so tough.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.920
And it's hilarious.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.000
These job descriptions are getting out of hand, that's for sure.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
>> Yeah.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.120
Well, with AI, it's probably not going to get better.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.440
We can talk about that more later.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.920
Before we get into that, let's just jump in with a little bit of background on you before

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.600
we get to the topic.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600
Tell us a bit about yourself.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600
What do you do?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.200
How did you get into Python?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200
Things like that.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.880
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.560
So I'm currently a data science consultant and also a data science instructor.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.120
I run some online programs where I teach people to become data analysts, mostly, is what I'm

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.840
focused on.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.680
But I also have this practice where I help companies solve data problems with different

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.200
techniques.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.560
I started actually by studying chemical engineering in college in my undergraduate degree.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.320
And about a semester in, I realized, "Crap, I hate this.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.320
This is not for me."

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.320
But I was a little bit- >> Oh my gosh.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.320
>> Do you agree?

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.880
Have you- >> Well, I did a semester of chemical engineering

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880
as well.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.880
I thought, "I love chemistry.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.880
I love math.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880
Put them together."

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.400
Somehow, they don't go together.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.080
It's like ice cream and eggs or something.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.280
No, they don't go together, for me at least.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.840
>> No, it wasn't good for me either.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.520
I was just like, "Oh man, I'm actually not interested in refineries or manufacturing."

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.160
But I, like you, liked chemistry.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.160
I liked math.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160
I thought this is perfect.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.640
But I quickly realized, "Oh man, I really like this whole programming part that I get

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.000
to do in MATLAB at the time when I was an undergrad."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.160
And I was on a time crunch to get through college quickly through eight semesters.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.600
And the other issue I had was I didn't know what to do instead.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.620
It was like, I don't really want to study computer science.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.680
Part of the reason why is they can't have this weed out course at the beginning, which

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.800
you had to build Excel from scratch, basically, some sort of a spreadsheeting tool.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.600
I was like, "Why would I rebuild something that already exists that I don't even like

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.800
using in the first place?"

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800
I wasn't really into it.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.120
So I didn't know what to do.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.120
And luckily, I was working as a lab technician at this company, a really cool company that

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.180
makes these sensors that basically have the ability to smell.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.720
So they can sniff what's in the air and it has applications for finding drugs or bombs

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.600
and airports and stuff like that.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.620
And there was a data scientist on staff and that data scientist was awesome.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.500
He was showing me all these cool algorithms he was writing for these sensors.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.080
And then one day he got up and left and he left the company.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.360
And we tried to hire another data scientist for six months, but they were really expensive.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.400
We were a small company and none of them really wanted to move to Utah where I lived in Salt

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.400
Lake City.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.840
And so we couldn't really find someone that would be able to do it.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.000
And so finally I was like, "Well, I really like this programming stuff."

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.360
And the data scientist showed me a thing or two, maybe I could take a stab at this.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.200
And I wrote my first machine learning algorithm and I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm addicted

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200
to this."

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.000
And then I never looked back and have been data science since, basically.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
What a great story.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.920
Yeah, I think a lot of people fall into programming that way.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.840
And for some reason, not unexpectedly, but for some reason, a lot of people fall into

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.600
Python that way as well.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.880
They're like, "You know, I have a job and I got this thing I got to do.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.880
I just need a little bit more than maybe like an Excel spreadsheet or something."

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.160
And put it together and you're like, "Actually, this is cool."

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.080
After a while, like, "This is cooler than what I've been doing."

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.080
Or maybe I'll make it a good part of what I do, right?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.980
Yeah, a hundred percent.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.880
Even just making, it was in MATLAB, which is basically engineer's version of Python

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.640
or college version of Python 10 years ago, right?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640
I made like Tic-Tac-Toe.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.120
And I remember playing Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.120
I think that's what it was, or maybe it was Hangman.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.120
I can't remember.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.640
But I remember the idea of being able to program games and play against the computer and I

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.640
built it.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.080
I was like, "This is the coolest thing ever.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.760
I got to do more of this."

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.760
Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:31.780
I've done some MATLAB too when I was younger and it's not that different from Python, but

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.820
it's, I think one of the big differences other than it just being embedded in a big expensive

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.820
app, is it's not a general purpose programming language, right?

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:47.300
You wouldn't go, "That was fun, but let me go build this website in MATLAB," or, "Let

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.540
me create Airbnb in MATLAB."

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:57.280
You just don't want to sort of, Azure has this self-prescribed limit to what you can

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.280
do with it.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.280
Yeah.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.840
I mean, that's one of the coolest parts about Python is it's really a Swiss army knife and

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.840
you can pretty much do, I don't want to say anything, but pretty close to anything in

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.800
Python, which makes it really neat.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.960
And obviously one of the huge limitations of MATLAB is, one, it costs thousands of dollars,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960
but two, you're right.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.720
It's not going to do cybersecurity for you.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.660
It's not going to build websites.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.780
But the syntax at the end of the day was really quick.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.420
It was easy for me to transition from MATLAB to Python because the syntax isn't all that

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.420
different.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.200
No, it's not all that different.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.620
More math focused, but pretty similar.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:38.980
I think maybe that's a good place to start discussing and exploring this topic of your

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.380
first data science job.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.420
And I wouldn't necessarily plan on starting here, but let's start with before you even

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.520
necessarily know a programming language, right?

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.820
Maybe you've dabbled in MATLAB or you've dabbled in Excel or even dabbled in JavaScript or

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.700
something.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.540
This thing we've been talking about with MATLAB and it applies to other areas as well, like

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:10.060
through programming languages per se, like Julia or something like that is how, if you

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.940
invest your time into learning one of these things really well, like how broadly industry

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.600
wide of a skill, high demand skill is that going to be, right?

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.400
You learn MATLAB, you put yourself in a box, you learn a more general programming language,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.180
you kind of have more options afterwards, right?

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.040
Yeah, totally.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:36.140
I think the more broad of a language you learn, the more useful you are to more industries

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.140
in general.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:42.500
But I might take that even a step further and just say, learning MATLAB, not a whole

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:48.420
lot of companies use MATLAB, but just like landing your first data job, going from zero

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.860
to one is the hardest.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.220
Learning your first language, zero to one is the hardest as well.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.940
And then once you have that first language, the next language becomes so much easier.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:02.180
So one of the first things I learned was MATLAB and then I moved to Python and that was easier.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.380
And then I learned SQL and then I learned R and then I learned JavaScript.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.540
And every time I added a new tool to my toolkit, it was quite, not what I want to say, it was

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.140
easy, but it got easier with each one.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.660
I think that's true with foreign languages as well.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.380
Once you learn one foreign language, then the third and the fourth become quite easy.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.260
At least that's what I heard.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.340
I speak kind of two and a half languages, but there's people who speak like seven and

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.580
they always say the sixth and the seventh become easier.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.420
Yeah, you wonder how could you possibly, because learning the first one is so hard, first foreign

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.620
language, so you're like, well, how could you possibly take that on for this many languages?

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.820
And it's that it's not the same challenge each time, right?

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.060
Yeah, exactly.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.060
Yeah.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:48.460
So I think when people are considering getting into data science, they really want to consider

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.700
what language they choose and where they go.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.420
Like if you're coming out of a college program, you might feel like MATLAB or something like

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.060
that's real popular.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:03.180
And yet that's because it's popular amongst professors who force their students to do

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.180
it.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.180
That doesn't necessarily mean that's the broad worldview.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.740
What do you think about R?

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.740
You know both.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.840
Yeah, I like R. I sometimes troll R on LinkedIn.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.740
So I guess that's another thing I should say is I post a lot on LinkedIn.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.500
I'm kind of a LinkedIn guy.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.940
And so a lot of the times, honestly, just for jokes and kicks and giggles, I'll kind

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.820
of roast R on LinkedIn just to get the trolls angry in the comments.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.820
It's quite fun.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.820
It's quite a fun experience.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.140
But I'm not that big of a hater.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.420
I definitely think R has its place.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.340
The one thing that's really interesting about R versus Python is obviously a big debate

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:45.220
in the data science community is R is kind of that does one thing really well.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.980
And it's getting a little less of that as more packages and libraries are added to R,

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.900
but R does the statistics and machine learning very well.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.340
But obviously, I don't think once again, I don't know any websites, any super functioning

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.780
websites that are built on R. I don't know any cybersecurity that's really done very

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.220
well via R. So I think R does what it does well.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.100
The syntax sometimes is a lot easier for people to go from Excel, which a lot of people are

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.900
more familiar with in the finance or banking world, for example.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.740
The syntax in R is a little bit more similar to those Excel formulas than it is to Python.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.740
So I think sometimes people have a little bit more success just because, "Oh, this

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.900
kind of feels like Excel formulas."

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.980
And so people really get there.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.780
I think what you're kind of alluding to is if you're going to learn one skill, you might

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.700
as well learn the one skill that's applicable to the most, the widest net.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:44.500
And so that way you're fishing in the biggest lake you possibly could versus in a smaller

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.900
pond of R. I think that's worth looking at.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.220
And one of the things I actually really enjoy doing, because you mentioned, "Oh, you might

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.500
think MATLAB is popular because that's what the professors taught you."

00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:00.340
And there's actually not a whole lot of data out there about, well, what should you learn?

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.740
So I don't know if you know who Luke Burrus is.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.740
He's a data analyst YouTuber.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.420
I was going to say YouTuber on YouTube, but that's kind of redundant, on YouTube.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.740
And one of the things he's done is he's actually built this tool where he's web scraping thousands

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:20.120
of jobs, different data jobs every week, and then displaying and analyzing the skills required

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120
for those jobs.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.780
So it's actually like a data-driven way of saying, if you want to be a data scientist,

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.460
what skills should you actually be focusing on as you go, as opposed to just listening

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:36.300
to what a professor will say or what a LinkedIn influencer will say or what your bootcamp

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.740
will say.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.860
Actually getting some data on, I think is pretty neat.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.860
Yeah.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.140
That is super cool.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.980
And I'm not familiar with Luke, so we're going to dig him up and put him in the show notes

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.020
for later so people can check that out.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.020
For sure.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.620
Do you remember any of the trends he's recently talked about?

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.940
So yeah, it's datanerd.tech, I think is the website there.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:02.340
And I look at it mostly for data analysts because that's who I work with the most.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.940
So I know the data analyst data very well.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.420
SQL is number one at 50%.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.780
I think Python is number two at like 30%.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.300
I think Python might've jumped it.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.420
Well, this is for all data positions right here.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.940
So the job title, you can choose.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.620
Which one are you thinking I should pick here?

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.620
Data?

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.620
Maybe data scientist is the most applicable.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.620
Data scientist, yeah.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.620
Right.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.620
Yeah, you're right.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.620
Wow.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.620
Oh, whoa, Python 69%.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.620
Look at that.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.620
Yeah.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.620
So that's huge.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:39.940
So that's even, what, 20% more than SQL, which a lot of people are like, if you want to be

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.060
a data scientist, you have to know SQL.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.060
Well, if you look at the job descriptions, Python's mentioned a lot more.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.500
So if you're brand new and you're going to learn one, you might as well start with Python

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.140
because that's probably the most in demand skill that there is right now for a data scientist.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.140
Yeah.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.140
And it's pretty easy, right?

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.180
It's not like, well, why don't you just learn C++ for embedded devices?

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.700
You're like, you know what?

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.220
Maybe I'll pick something else to start with.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.220
Right.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.220
But Python's pretty easy.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.220
Yeah.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.860
I think I agree with you.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.340
I think Python's great.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.500
I actually think, I think SQL is probably easier to learn if I'm being honest, because

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.540
really, especially for like data science stuff, it's only about like 20 commands that you

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.900
need to know in SQL.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.260
But once again, SQL is a lot more, there's no websites built on SQL, I'll tell you that

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.260
much.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.980
So it's a lot more limited on what it can do.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.420
It's a skill, but not the language.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.940
It's not enough on its own generally.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:37.860
I mean, you can do reports and quite a bit with it, but you know, it's like when you

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.220
see these programming popularity, like what's the most popular language?

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.660
Oh, look, CSS is the third most popular.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.060
That's not a language.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.740
That's a thing that you use with other languages, right?

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.300
Use it with all the other languages.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.980
That's why it's high up, but that doesn't mean it's high in demand.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:54.980
Exactly.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.980
It's just like table stakes, you know?

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.980
Yeah.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:03.420
So you kind of got to distinguish table stakes from like picking an area, I think.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.420
Yeah.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.180
Well, I think that's totally true.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:12.300
And really, I mean, I think Pythonistas could make the argument that there's really nothing

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.420
in SQL that you couldn't do in Python.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.780
Now that's a little somewhat true depending on data size and stuff like that.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.180
But regardless, there is ways that you can do most of the SQL commands in Python one

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.180
way or another.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.180
Yeah.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.740
It could be, when I first became a data scientist, I didn't even know SQL and I was doing SQL

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:36.460
commands or I was doing the aggregations or the where functions or the window functions

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.460
using Python.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.140
So you definitely can, as long as your data is not like super big, then you'll totally

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.140
be fine.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.140
Right.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.380
So you can do things like generator or even slices or yeah, things like that.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.380
Right.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.140
List comprehensions, set comprehensions, all that kind of stuff.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:58.820
It's kind of like, gosh, I really wish, really wish, a little bit of a sidebar, but I wish

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.620
list comprehensions and all those things had just a few more SQL features.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.620
Right.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.540
Like in a list comprehension, I say, give me this thing, maybe give me this property

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.660
of this class modified, like give me the user's name uppercased.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.660
Right.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:20.580
So that's like select and then for thing in collection, that's like from table or whatever.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.580
Right.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.420
And then you have the where clause with the if statement, but boy, wouldn't it be cool

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:31.460
to have like a sort also in there and other things like that, you know?

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.140
Oh, well, totally.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.140
It's so close.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.140
It is.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.260
But the cool thing is, is if you want that sort, it's what one extra line.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.940
Like it's not too bad.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.780
So Python, I mean, I don't want to say this necessarily to hate all to make all the data

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:50.820
scientists and SQL lovers mad, but really Python can do a lot of the things that SQL

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.820
can.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.820
That's for sure.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.820
Yeah.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.820
Yeah, that's for sure.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:17:01.460
Probably the biggest, it's a bit of a diversion, but the biggest similarity to that I've seen

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:08.660
in the languages is C#'s link where they actually have almost all the query operators, including

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.380
joins and stuff like that built into the programming language.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:18.260
I'd love to see more of that kind of inspiration into Python, but you know, that's all right.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.260
It's still really good.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.540
I've got a lot of cool SQL like features, but you're right.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.220
Once you are no longer working with data memory or you want indexes, right?

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:30.780
Like this concept of indexes is not sufficiently well understood.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.220
I think every time I hit a website that takes five seconds to load, I'm like, somebody is

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.940
not doing all the things they should be doing.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.220
I just know it.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.380
Yeah, that's totally true.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.660
So what about SQL?

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.100
You know, let's talk about that for a bit, right?

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:50.380
The SQL, the query language for databases and other things.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:57.380
There's ways to SQL query, not just relational databases, but you said you got away with

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.320
not quite learning that, but do you think if you could start over, maybe making an effort

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.820
to learn that would be really valuable?

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.940
Like how important is this a thing in the beginning of your career?

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:15.460
The interesting thing, you know, about landing a data job is your skills only plays, I say

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.640
a third of the role.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.740
Your portfolio or the way that you portray your skills and your network, I think are

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.020
the other two thirds and are actually more important than your skills.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.860
And that's kind of how I got away with not knowing SQL and not even being, to be honest,

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:37.340
that good at Python at the time was because I used my network to be in the situation to

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.980
get my lab technician job in the first place.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.500
And then once again, I used that same network, in this case, my coworkers to land that first

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.180
data scientist position after we couldn't hire anyone.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.620
And if I would have been applying externally for that role, chances are I wouldn't have

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.620
gotten that role.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.860
I probably didn't know enough at the time to land that type of a role, but because they

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:03.140
knew I was hardworking, they knew I wasn't like a total idiot and I really liked to learn,

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.700
they took that chance on me.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.260
And it paid off really well for them because at the time I was still in college and so

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.500
I wasn't getting paid that much and I was not getting paid like a data scientist, but

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.060
I was getting results like a data scientist for them.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.820
So I think it paid off for both of us.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.860
But I think if that was an external job and I applied for it, I probably didn't have enough

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.180
skills for it.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.020
So I definitely think learning SQL, if you want to land a data science job, isn't a bad

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:33.180
place to start, especially because like I said, I mean, any programming language, I

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.380
like to think of like the iceberg, kind of like the Titanic, right?

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:41.060
There's the parts that you see and then there's the parts that you don't even know that are

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.060
there.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.180
And really you could spend the rest of your life trying to master SQL or the rest of your

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.220
life trying to learn Python.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.500
But the cool thing is, is a lot of the time you only need that top little bit that's sitting

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:56.000
at the top of the surface of the water to actually get stuff done.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.280
And so for SQL, I think that's like 20 commands and I think you could learn it honestly in

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.860
like a month.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.900
You could learn those 20 commands pretty easily.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.380
But it worked out for me and I didn't have to use it that much at the time until I was

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.020
probably about almost three years into my job.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.780
And I actually had switched jobs to a bigger company.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.140
The other thing that I was working for a smaller company where we didn't have a ton of data,

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.460
so we could use CSVs kind of as our database, which is not great practice.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.680
But when I eventually became a data scientist at ExxonMobil, I was going to say they didn't

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.140
use Excel as a database, but they still did.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.300
But the point is they had much larger SQL databases with hundreds of thousands, actually

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.860
millions of rows of data.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.860
Yeah.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.940
Then you got to be really, you need to understand it at a much deeper level.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.380
You're like, if you do a query like this, it's going to be super slow.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.820
But if you do it like that, it can use the composite index for the sort and then blah,

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.820
blah, blah, blah.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.820
Right.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.820
Then yeah.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.380
You're getting to the bottom of the iceberg in SQL or maybe not the bottom, maybe like

00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.580
the middle chunk under the water, but there's so much to learn for both of them.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.260
Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:09.940
So Amira, the audience asks, when you talk data job, what kind of jobs are out there?

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.780
So we talked both about how we did chemical engineering and then we saw chemical factories

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.780
like, yeah, I don't really want to work here anymore.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.380
I'm out.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.060
So thinking about like, well, what are the kinds of jobs you do?

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:30.140
I think that's really important because it's easy to get focused in on like the FANG companies.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.780
Like I want to work for like some super big tech company.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.660
I want to move to San Francisco and like that, that, that, right.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.380
Like, you know what?

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.500
There's not just plenty of other jobs, but the opportunities, just like you described

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:49.100
and as well as my first job, I worked at a company that had like eight people.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.820
And it was awesome.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.820
Right.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:57.300
They didn't expect me to be, you know, running Kubernetes clusters and doing all sorts of

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.300
crazy.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.500
They're just like, I need you to make this thing happen.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.980
Can you do like, I'm pretty new, but that thing I can make that happen.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:04.980
Like let's go.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:05.980
Right.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.100
And I feel like the possibilities to get in, especially with these maybe more niche

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:16.700
type of industries and companies might even be easier for a first job.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.300
People seem to be really obsessed with, with the FANG.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.380
And I don't know if that's like a societal thing or if it's just, those are the companies

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.380
that we use a lot.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.260
And so we're excited about them, but yeah, there's so many more data jobs outside of

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.660
FANG than there are inside of FANG, even though there's, there's quite a bit inside of FANG.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:38.700
And oftentimes those roles can be much more interesting and you can do a lot bigger of

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.700
an impact.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:45.300
When, when I was working at this small company, VaporSense, I like, I had so much power.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.380
I didn't even realize it.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.340
I had such a big effect on the company.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:54.180
I was presenting to, you know, fortune 500 companies and what I did really made a difference.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:59.740
And when it came to the point where ExxonMobil offered me to go be a data scientist for Exxon,

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.860
I said, Oh, I want to go work for the big company with the nice desk and the nice laptop

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.060
and you know, try something new.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:12.140
And when I got there, I really, I mean, I had some pretty cool opportunities when I

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.700
was at ExxonMobil, but ultimately I left pretty shortly after two years of being there because

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.180
I just felt like a cog in the machine and I didn't feel like I was actually making a

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:24.520
difference and that was really important to my work satisfaction of like, is what I'm

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.180
doing being used?

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.660
Is it being used to better the world?

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.100
Do I feel valued?

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.500
And the answer was kind of no for me when I was there.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.820
So there's definitely a trade-off between the small companies and the big companies,

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:39.820
but also to go back to your original question, there are so many freaking roles in the data

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.620
world that you're not even thinking of that, like I'm not even thinking of.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:48.340
I saw a new one the other day when I was helping one of my students, it was like, it wasn't

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.740
data janitor, but it was something like that where I was like, I don't even know what that

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.740
role is, but there's so many roles.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:24:01.020
When I was a data scientist at VaporSense, the small company, my actual title was junior

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:06.100
chemo-matrician, which basically means you're doing data science with chemistry.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:11.100
When I was at ExxonMobil, when I was first there, I was doing data science, but my actual

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.100
title was optimization engineer.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:19.060
And so there's so many titles that we don't even think to search of, or even to look up,

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.380
but those are all data science roles.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.100
I was doing machine learning every day in both those roles, and you would maybe never

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.780
guess from those titles.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.300
Yeah, you would never guess.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.120
No, that's awesome.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.140
What machine learning libraries, frameworks were using?

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.140
Let's see.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.780
So at VaporSense, once again, because it's a smaller company, I had a lot more say in

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.100
what I was doing.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:45.740
So we were building a bunch of machine, we were building classification models to basically

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.740
take the data from our sensors and sniff if something was in the air.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:55.780
Sometimes that was a yes, no, like, oh yes, there is ammonia in the semiconductor factory

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:56.780
and that's bad.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.940
So that's a yes classification kind of binary, right?

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.420
Other times it was, what drug is this?

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.220
Is this meth or is this heroin?

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:13.540
One of the use cases we had was, this is binary once again, but is this recreational marijuana

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.540
or medicinal marijuana?

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.100
And can we tell the difference between those?

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:23.220
So we were usually using classification models, usually built in scikit-learn in Python the

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.700
majority of the time there.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.820
When I was at Exxon, we had a lot less say, like the data scientists had a lot less say

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.580
in the decision making process.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:39.340
We were doing a lot of multivariate linear regression with a lot of crazy hacks and transformations

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.420
kind of in the meantime for one of my positions there.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:47.180
And then the other time, the other position I did there, we were doing a lot of auto ML

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.580
using PyCaret and letting it kind of decide what type of models to do.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.580
So lots of models-

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.780
- Okay, unsupervised learning type stuff, huh?

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.980
- Yeah, it was awesome.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.740
It was really fun to...

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:03.100
I love PyCaret 'cause it's like, okay, go make 25 models and tell me which one's the

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.100
best.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.620
It's like, makes my job easy, I guess.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.900
- We're gonna be creative with sheer numbers.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.740
That's how we're gonna come up with a solution.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.740
Got it.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.740
- Exactly.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.740
- Cool.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.900
Diego is asking like, what are some of the common stats methods as in mathematical type

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.620
stuff you would use?

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:26.940
So one of the things I know that some people getting into programming think is you gotta

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.380
be really good at math to be a programmer.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:36.820
And I think you gotta be really good at logical thinking, but you need to almost zero math

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.220
to be like a web developer.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:46.260
We're talking percents for CSS, incrementing numbers from one to two to two to three for

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.660
IDs and stuff like that.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.660
But for data science, maybe there's a little bit more.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.380
Where do you see that kind of background?

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.260
- I think, yeah, I like what you said.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.460
You have to think logically, but maybe the math isn't as important.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.780
And I think it's actually somewhat similar in data science.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:10.020
I will say you probably need a little bit more math than a web developer, but I think

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.700
it's a lot less than most people think.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:17.720
And it's probably less about being able to do the math and maybe more about understanding

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.740
the mathematical concepts.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:25.100
And what I mean by that is a lot of, so I also have a master's degree in data analytics.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.380
A lot of master's degrees in data science and data analytics will say you need calculus

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:33.060
and linear algebra as kind of a background for your math.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.260
And that kind of stops people.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.500
I don't want to do any calculus.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.220
I don't want to do any linear algebra.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.460
And while both those concepts do exist in data science principles, the majority of the

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.580
time the computer, Python, is doing the math.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:50.500
You just have to be able to interpret the results of the math and kind of know what

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:56.500
different directions, like if this is going down with an optimization problem, okay, that's

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.320
the derivative getting closer to zero.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.940
It's really less about knowing how to do the math by hand and more just understanding what

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.020
the math, the computer is actually doing.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.660
So I think it's actually a lot easier than most people say.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.620
That being said, knowing how to do a derivative or take an integral, those concepts I think

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.220
is probably underlying pretty important.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:23.460
But other than that, a lot of the times I'm doing linear regression because it's awesome.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.780
It gets the job done.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:29.860
A lot of the time I'm doing hypothesis testing and statistics, which you have to look like

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.860
at a P-score.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.660
Nothing all that crazy.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:38.580
At Exxon, I had to do a lot of linear programming, but that's honestly, that's like the exception

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.780
versus the rule.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:44.740
There's not a whole lot of linear programming for most data scientists.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.740
So I really don't think the math is all that hard.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:53.060
Now of course, that's coming from someone who got a chemical engineering degree, who

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.540
had to take all the calculus, all the linear algebra.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.020
So I did go through those courses.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:01.340
I haven't really done it from scratch from like a lot of my students are teachers, for

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.700
example, who never took those courses in college.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.900
So I can't speak from that perspective, but a lot of my students are able to figure it

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.620
out at the end of the day and transfer.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.620
So it happens.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.380
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.860
I think you make a good point.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:20.740
I think it's about knowing, okay, this formula or this algorithm or this test means this

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.740
thing.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.740
It applies in this situation.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.980
It doesn't apply in that situation.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.580
Here's what you're trying to get from it, right?

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.820
Like I know I need to do a fast Fourier transform.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.660
So, and this is what it tells me when I get out the other side, but do I need to be able

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:43.220
to sit down and recreate the integral and the calculus behind it and do that on like

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.460
a home, like as a homework example, and I give me a function and I'll do the Fourier

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.580
transform and I'll actually do the symbolic integration.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.780
Like, no, you probably don't need that.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.780
Right.

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.500
But you need to know I do the Fourier transform in this situation and this is why.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.660
And then I just say, call the function, do it right.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.020
And interpret the results.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.020
Really that's what being a data scientist is all about is, yeah.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:13.420
What does, what does the business use case, what's the desired business use case?

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.580
How do I relate that use case to the data?

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.620
What technique can I use to get the outcome that I need?

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:25.420
Computer go do it, interpret results, present to stakeholders.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.420
That's a data scientist.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:31.540
I think one of the challenges with that, it's going to be not that it's not good, but I

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:38.420
think it's going to be challenging because how do you learn when to use a certain statistical

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:47.000
test or when to do some kind of funky transformation, like a Fourier transform without more traditional

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.980
mathematical backgrounds and all the academics will not just go, Oh, we're just going to

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.540
give you like five minute overview and they'll help you understand.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:01.020
They're like, Nope, we're going to start with this axiom or this theorem from differential

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.020
equations.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.020
I'm going to work up.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.460
You're like, no, no, no, no, no.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.460
I really, I don't need that.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.500
I don't, I'm not on a four year plan.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.700
I'm on a four week plan.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:16.420
How do I, how do I get value from a couple of the mathematical things without being sucked

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.500
into like, yeah, now I'm in differential equations at Harvard online and I don't understand how

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.980
I got there.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:26.340
It's such a big problem and I'm so glad you brought this up.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.980
And I'll be, I'll be vulnerable because yeah, I felt the same, the same way.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.780
And I was like, there has to be a better way.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.420
And so about, what was it?

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.300
Three years ago now, two and a half years ago, three years ago, I said, Oh my gosh,

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.060
I'm going to solve this problem and I'm going to start my own data science bootcamp.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.540
And so I spent about six months making the curriculum, making all the videos.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.820
I opened it up, I got some students in there and I ran it for about six months and I looked

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.900
at the results and man, we weren't getting anyone into data science jobs.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.060
And I thought, Oh, what the heck am I doing wrong?

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.260
I had this brilliant idea of like, we're going to be less theory, more project, more hands

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.500
on.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:08.500
And I realized, man, the truth is people just learn better at work.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.980
That's where you learn that whole technique that you just like, how did someone learn

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.980
that?

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.800
The answer is by getting experience and learning it at work.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.260
And when I looked back and I said, okay, well we have had students get jobs.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.260
What jobs did they get?

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:25.220
And it turns out most of them were getting like business intelligence, intelligence engineer

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:30.460
jobs or data analysts or financial analyst jobs that were a little bit below a data scientist

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:31.460
job.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:36.900
And I realized, Oh man, if we can just help people go from zero to one and get their foot

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:42.660
in the door, they can go from one to five much quicker at work because work is just,

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.900
I don't know, it's this magical place where like you said, whatever you were working at

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.700
earlier and they're like, Hey, can you do this Kubernetes thing?

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.660
They just kind of throw you in the fire and you're like, figure it out.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:53.660
And that's somehow you do.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.420
I don't know what it is about work, but you figure it out and that's where you learn.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:01.020
So that's kind of what I've, why I changed my curriculum to be more focused on, you know,

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.260
okay, maybe people aren't going to become data scientists, but can we get them to zero

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.980
to one quickly and then they can get paid to learn the rest of the data science stuff

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.180
when they're actually in that first position.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.180
Yeah.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:17.620
Well, how much do you know about what you actually want to do in the industry before

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.060
you've done it as well?

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.060
Right?

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.300
I mean, I used to be like, Oh, I thought everybody said machine learning was awesome.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:29.140
And I've used chat GP, she PT and I loved it, but it turns out actually like API is

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.900
better, but I've never had a chance to build an API.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:36.340
So until I started, I didn't even learn that one, it was a thing too, that it was cool

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.940
or vice versa, right?

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.940
Whatever.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:43.140
But until you get kind of in, you don't even know, like, actually this part is where I

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.860
really am enjoying it.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.820
And so just getting that first step, that's a big deal.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.300
A hundred percent.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.820
It's, you don't know what you don't know until you know it.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:34:00.640
And that's why, I mean, really when it comes to, if we go back to just SQL or just Python,

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:06.140
you could spend, I tell people this, if you tried to master Python before you applied

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.660
to a job, you'd be like 80 years old before you ever applied to a job.

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.340
Same with SQL, same with machine learning.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.460
The cool thing about data is we're never going to know it all.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.480
And so just learn the bare minimum to get your foot in the door.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.660
And then you have this place where you're going to get paid to learn what you want to

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:23.660
learn eventually.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.900
If you learn, Oh, I love APIs.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.860
I promise you that there's a company out there that will hire you and you can learn APIs

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.860
on the job.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.860
Like that's going to happen.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.860
But that first step.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:36.660
There's a company out there that it doesn't know it needs APIs, right?

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.540
But you can help them and they don't have huge expectations because this is the thing

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:41.900
they just learned they needed.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.900
Right?

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.900
A hundred percent.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.900
Yeah.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.900
It's wild.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:46.900
Right.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:47.900
All right.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:48.900
So that's a really cool place.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:54.020
I mean, I know you talked about being connected on LinkedIn pretty well and certainly having

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:59.940
some kind of social network support and maybe it's not that you would call it not social,

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:06.140
but a real world network of actual human beings that you're physically know somehow.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.140
What's that?

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.140
I don't know what that is.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.140
I know.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.540
We gave that up back in 2020 I thought.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:17.860
Anyway, there was some stat that I saw somewhere that over half of the jobs are filled with

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.060
people before it even becomes a job posting.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.060
Right?

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:26.180
Maybe some of the best ones is like, Hey, who knows somebody who can do this?

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.340
We need some like your data science example, a data scientist example.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.740
They quit like, Oh, we need somebody.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.980
Anybody know a good data scientist?

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:36.620
I don't want to just go put it out on the open job market and have to have a hundred

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.220
interviews and who knows what I'm going to get.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.180
Like if you can recommend somebody, let's start there.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.180
Right?

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:47.460
So being in that group to be recommended, it's important.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.660
It's, it's the key.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:54.740
There was a really interesting survey done on LinkedIn and they said it was kind of,

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:58.740
it was done by the same person and Jordan Nelson, by the way.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.140
He said, how do you approach getting a job?

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.980
And then the next day he said, how did you get your last job?

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.580
And 80% of people, they use what I call the spray and pray method, which basically means

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.660
you go and you apply to as many jobs as you possibly can and hope for the best cross your

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.660
fingers.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.020
That was 80% of what people were doing.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:24.460
And then on the next poll the next day, it was a total, I think of what, 70% were either

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.540
headhunted recruited or referred.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.860
And so it's like the parental principle here where, you know, 80% of the effort is only

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:37.020
getting you 20% of the results and really 20% of the effort gets 80% of the results.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.020
So it's okay.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.500
We know networking and getting recruited is really important, but how do we do it?

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.060
It's easier said than done.

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.060
Right.

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.060
I'm not in the industry.

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.580
How do I make friends who are right?

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.500
It's like, well, my neighbors don't do it.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.300
So I guess I'm out.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.980
That's the tricky thing is, yeah, if you're not in the industry yet, how do you get recruited

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.900
into it or how do you know someone?

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.580
And what I've come to learn is it actually doesn't even matter.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.520
So like for instance, let's take your neighbor, right?

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.500
Your neighbor is probably not a data scientist.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.500
Maybe you're lucky and they are, and they can refer you to a company.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.620
But what's really cool is I've learned that companies really come to trust their employees

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.340
and their employees' recommendations.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:20.700
And so even if your neighbor, let's say is a web developer or maybe even less technical,

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.020
let's just say your recruiter is in finance, right?

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:28.260
And if there's an opening, like a data science opening at that company, a lot of the times

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:33.300
they will actually take their employee referrals much more seriously than any sort of cold

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.720
application that they get.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.300
And so a lot of the times I've had students who just know someone that works at the company.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.340
They saw a job opening pop up.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.820
Very quickly they messaged their friends, "Hey, do you know a recruiter or a hiring

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:45.820
manager?

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:46.820
I could talk more about this role.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.340
Could you do an internal referral for me?"

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.740
And they were able to land jobs that they probably wouldn't have.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.500
No, they definitely wouldn't have without that internal referral.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.260
So it is tricky.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.260
It's the old cliche.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.020
It's not what you know, it's who you know.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.020
Sure.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:06.180
I think there's still plenty of ways, COVID notwithstanding.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.580
I think that these days there's plenty of ways to get those connections, right?

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:14.580
But maybe people don't know, like meetup.com is really good.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:19.620
If you live in a non-tiny city, right?

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:26.440
There's many, many things going on around data science, around Python, around other

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.420
data engineering, whatever, right?

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.420
You could go to those things.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.980
They're typically even free.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:31.980
Often they are free with food.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.340
They even feed you, right?

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:40.060
And make connections or regional conferences or national conferences, right?

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:44.660
Like we probably, many people have heard of PyCon, right?

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:50.340
There's US PyCon, there's EuroPython, and then there's, but that's, those are the ones

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:55.020
that are loft and talked about, but there's 10, 20 little smaller regional ones in the

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.260
US and many more that I'm not aware of throughout the world.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.660
There's probably one of those within driving distance, right?

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:07.100
That you could go to make connections and just also kind of take the temperature of

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:12.100
actually what you see on the internet versus what you see and actually talking to real

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.100
people.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.900
So I'd also say just get out there.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.880
A hundred percent.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:25.380
Those places have the people who probably want to hire you because they're local, right?

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.700
Which is one thing that's trouble on LinkedIn.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.900
I'm big on networking on LinkedIn, but a lot of the times you're going to be networking

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:36.100
the people who in all likelihood might never have a role that's even open to you.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:40.460
But the people that you're like, for instance, we have, I'm in Utah and we have Silicon Slopes

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.060
that has like a tech meetup.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.620
We have a local Python meetup chapter.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:52.220
We have the big data and developers conference that's free every year with tons of food.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.900
And the people who go there are people from companies around there that have the openings

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:01.020
that you're trying to find and they want to hire people like you who are in the area.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:05.140
So at least you can maybe come to the office once a week or maybe once a month or whatever.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:09.860
And so really, like you said, going to those meetups, it's tough because networking is

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.820
always difficult either online or in person.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.920
But at least in those situations, you know, hey, these are people that are tied to real

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.460
companies that exist around me that do make data hires.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.460
So I have a chance.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.460
Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.020
It's definitely a much higher chance than just shooting out a resume.

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.020
All right.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.540
Let's see.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.300
We talked about job hunting already.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.940
What about like applications and resumes?

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.340
What are your thoughts on that?

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:41.620
I think once again with the applications, the more targeted that you can make it, the

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.620
better.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.620
Right.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:48.540
So if you can really hone in on I really want this job, I'm going to cold message five people

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:52.620
at this company and see if I can get that internal referral one way or another, make

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.620
a real connection with them.

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:55.260
I think that's really key.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.660
And with resumes, resumes are more of an art than they are a science.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.500
I feel like they are so difficult to figure out.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:08.020
And these ATSs that are trying to match you and see if you're a good fit.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.420
I've tried a lot of them and a lot of them suck.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.260
Like whoever's whoever's the data scientist behind those.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.060
We need to have a conversation with them because it's it's a little tricky sometimes.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:21.260
But one of the coolest concepts I've been introduced to recently, and I have a whole

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:25.820
episode on my podcast about it, is A/B testing your resume.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:33.100
And basically the idea is a resume job is just to get you a screener interview or or

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.220
like a beginner interview, basically.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.220
It's all an interview.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.740
Like no one's seeing a resume and then hiring you.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.740
They're always going to interview.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:44.140
So if you think about it, a resume's job, the only job it has is to convince someone

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.100
to get on the phone and talk to you.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.040
And it's just a piece of paper.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.040
And guess what?

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.220
You can put whatever you want on that piece of paper.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:58.020
Now I'm not saying to lie, but I'm just saying you could theoretically make a perfect resume

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.900
for whatever job you're trying to go for and send it out there and see what happens.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.060
But I'm not saying to do that.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.060
I'm not saying to lie.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:08.980
My point in saying this is that the resume is just to get you the interview.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.000
And if you're not getting interviews, something's probably wrong with your resume.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.660
And so, you know, tweak something, apply to 10 more jobs, see what happens.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.460
Tweak something, apply to 10 more jobs, see what happens.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:25.860
Until you finally have the right combination of skills, of experiences, of different keywords.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.900
Because a lot of the time you're just trying to beat the ATS.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.500
And that's the sad part about it, is it's like, how do I prove to this random computer

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.060
algorithm that they should talk to me on the phone?

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.700
That's a hard game to beat.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.880
And there's a whole bunch of advice from all these different people.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.380
What I've come to learn is it's different for every company.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.780
It's different for every person.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:48.580
You kind of a numbers game until you get lucky and you figure it out.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:49.580
Yeah.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.580
That's good advice.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.080
I guess two thoughts.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:43:00.320
One is I know that, not speaking specifically to anyone, but in general, women wait until

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:06.120
they match all the requirements of a position where a guy's like, I know three of those

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.120
things.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.120
I'm taking a flyer, I'm sending it.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:13.720
I would just like to encourage the women out there to just send it as well.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.720
Totally.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.280
I think if you, I 100% agree with that.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:22.520
And I think if you reach 60% of the requirements, I think you have a chance.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.480
A lot of the times those are wishlists and not actual requirements.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.080
And depending on are you local to the area?

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.320
Do you have a domain experience in this company?

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.520
There's lots of other factors.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:39.820
What about contributing to open source or having GitHub repos that can be projects that

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.880
you can show off?

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.880
What's your advice there?

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.680
Oh, I'm a huge proponent of projects in a portfolio.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:52.240
I think if you don't have experience with something, you create your own by building

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.480
a project.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.320
And if you can do that with open source, I think you should totally do that because I've

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.120
benefited so much from open source.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:06.240
I have not given back as much as I should to open source development and projects.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.800
I definitely should do that.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.400
But if you can find a project that you're passionate about, that you can help with,

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.640
I think you should totally do that.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.240
Even if it's not open source and you're just building a project to showcase your skills,

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.480
I'm all about that.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.480
I think you can do projects that are super fun, maybe that are good for your community

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.600
or good for your life.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.960
I'm a huge fan of personal projects.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.120
I've put a Fitbit on my dog before and looked at her steps.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.560
I've found the healthiest meal at McDonald's.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:40.520
I've visualized my weight over time and tried to create different forecasting models and

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.520
stuff like that.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.000
There's so much data in our lives that you can use to make really cool projects.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Oh, absolutely.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.560
You talked about, okay, you get your first job and that's where you really learn.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.560
But if you don't have your first job, you can effectively simulate that.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.000
Say, I would have gone to a job and been given a project to analyze something.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.680
I'm just interested in this thing.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:06.600
I've got two hours a day until I get a job that I can be inspired about this and just

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.600
get going on it.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:13.240
Maybe create a website and publish your results and it can draw more people in to actually

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.800
see that and start to appreciate it.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.200
You could even ask, "Who's behind this cool project?

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.760
Maybe I want them to come work for me."

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:25.000
Little do they know you're doing all this work because you got some spare time and you're

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.680
trying to build up your experience and self-guided study.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.680
Yeah.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:34.240
If you can build a cool project and flip the job hunt where you're not applying for jobs,

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:38.360
but jobs start to apply for you, you're in such a good position.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.840
Doing really cool projects can help you get there.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.160
Now, it's hard to do cool projects.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.360
It's hard to publish projects, which is one of the things that people really struggle

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.360
with.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:54.080
For all you Python listeners out there, let me just tell you, Streamlit is absolutely

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:59.160
amazing because it makes the deployment process so easy.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.720
It's free.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:07.060
It's a little tricky to deploy at first, but compared to what you used to have to do back

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:12.440
in the day, I'm saying back in the day, like four years ago, basically.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.880
It was really hard to deploy something where you could send someone a URL, "Hey, check

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.440
out my web application, machine learning application."

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:24.360
But Streamlit is such a cool app that makes it so easy and so intuitive to make these

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.440
cool little apps that you could just put on your resume, put on your portfolio, send to

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.440
recruiters.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.280
I'm such a fan of the Streamlit app.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.280
I love it.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.280
Yeah.

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.280
It's super cool.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:40.120
There's a couple of those and Streamlit's definitely one of the really nice ones there.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.400
They host it.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.400
There's some hosting behind Streamlit as well these days, right?

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.360
You don't even have to set up a server or anything.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.440
You just create it and put it up there.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.000
That's what I'm saying.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Back in the day, I used Dash a lot.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.720
I'm still a big fan of Dash.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:02.120
Dash is more customizable than Streamlit and can do quite a bit more, but it's a lot more

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.520
work to deploy it.

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.160
It's more like programming.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.280
Yeah, it is a lot more programming.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.400
And the UI rather than just the behind the scenes.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.040
You have to do both.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:16.240
You have to know a little bit about systems and data engineering and stuff like that,

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.440
versus Streamlit kind of abstracts that away.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:24.720
But yeah, back in the day, I used to make Dash web applications and deploy them on Heroku

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.320
back when they had a free tier of hosting and they've taken that away.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.600
So I don't even know what the go-to free hosting platform is nowadays.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.560
I moved most of my things to Streamlit and it's so nice.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.880
Yeah, we got Shiny for Python now, which is also nice.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.880
I haven't checked that out.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:47.600
I haven't done too much with it either, but Joe and the team over there are doing pretty

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:53.160
cool stuff, like adding more dynamic interactive stuff to Jupyter, like running inside Jupyter

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.160
and things.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.160
Yeah, pretty cool.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.160
I'll have to check it out.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.160
Yeah.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.360
I think they also do a bunch of hosting stuff over there as well, which is why it came to

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.360
mind.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.360
All right.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:08.680
Yeah, what other advice you got for folks out there?

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:18.600
So AI, is AI not studying AI or learning to use AI machine learning, but is there a benefit

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:23.800
of trying to use ChatGPT to help you get this job or is there a danger?

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:29.840
Like I'm thinking, for example, like have a ChatGPT write me an awesome resume.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:33.640
And then the tools are like, well, we've detected this is AI generated and it's out.

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.640
You know what I mean?

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.680
Like what do you see happening there?

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:47.640
I think a lot of people see AI as like an all or nothing tool as in it's either you,

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:51.640
the human doing the work or it's the AI doing the work.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.840
But whenever, I don't know about you, but whenever I'm using ChatGPT for anything,

00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:01.440
it's very rare it's copy and paste for me or at least not iterative where I'm doing

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:05.720
multiple prompts, prompt after prompt, after prompt, trying to tweak it exactly what I

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:06.720
want.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:11.200
And so the way I look at ChatGPT and other gen AI that will be coming out, it's only

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:15.240
inevitable, is instead of looking at does this replace me?

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:19.480
Does this, you know, like for instance, am I going to build my whole resume using chat

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.480
GPT?

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.640
Am I going to build, can ChatGPT build, you know, take a data scientist's job and build

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.760
the whole model for them?

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.040
I like to see it more as like a hammer.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:33.680
It's like a tool for the data scientist or a tool for the job searcher to use in conjunction

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.760
with your screwdriver or anything else.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:42.360
It's like something to be wielded by human, not replaced for the human, if that makes

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.360
sense.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360
Right.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.080
You know, it's really good for stuff like, Hey, here's, I know a regular expression will

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.080
do this.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:52.860
The last time I studied, I completely forgot what this is about and I know it's gnarly,

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:56.440
but if I just ask, here's an example, here's what I want.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.360
And traditionally what you would end up doing is you'd be on stack overflow.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.360
Yeah.

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.360
You'd be all over the internet.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.240
You'd be trying to piece it together from external information anyway.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:10.600
And so code is something that's a little bit more in the wheelhouse of the generative AI

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:14.520
because it can't really make it up as much.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:19.200
I know it could like do something insecure and you didn't know it was or whatever, but

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.280
it's not like asking for legal advice where it makes up cases that didn't exist.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.600
Like it gives you code, you put it in the runtime or the compiler and it runs or it

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.600
doesn't work.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.600
Yeah.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.640
So it's, it's pretty, pretty effective for that.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:39.360
But yeah, for resumes, I would be more like, let me ask it, what are the in demand things?

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:43.840
And if I know these three skills, what other skills should I know to get a, you could sort

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:50.120
of use it in an explorative way to then come up with what you might write for yourself.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.120
Right.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.120
Something like this.

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.120
Yeah.

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:57.840
And I find it really useful for brainstorming like action verbs on your resume bullets.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.320
Like I think it's really good at that.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.520
What's 10 different ways to say lead.

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:05.680
So I don't say lead five times on my resume and I use some different action bullets.

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.040
I think it's great at that.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:14.800
I personally, it's pretty rare that I start any Python code from scratch nowadays.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:19.200
I'm either starting hopefully from a template that I've already written or I'm starting

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.040
from a ChatGPT.

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.480
Like this is what I kind of want to accomplish, right?

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.960
Like the outline for it.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.280
Like one of the things I hate doing is I make a lot of streamlet apps.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.520
I probably make a streamlet app a month right now.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.320
And I hate starting from scratch with streamlet.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:36.560
It's super easy to start from scratch, but I'll say, Hey, ChatGPT.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.320
I want to build a streamlet app.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.720
This is like the component I want here.

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.720
This is the component I want here.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.480
This is the component I want here.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:47.500
And it's almost like a warmup for me as a programmer and it will create, it'll create

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:48.940
something that works.

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:49.940
It's not what I want.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:54.440
And I spend the next five hours trying to make it what I want, you know, without chat

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:58.520
GPT, but it kind of gives me a warm start to my programming process.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.080
So I really like it.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.360
I think it's something that everyone should use.

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:06.860
And I think if you're thinking about getting into any sort of programming, you know, whether

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:12.480
it's data science or, or web development, I think you should be a little bit less worried

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.360
about it taking your job and job security.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.640
I think you should almost be more excited that, wow, the bar has never been lower to

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.840
break into tech.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:28.120
Like this is, this is a step up gift from the programming gods that I get to use to

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.860
break in the deck.

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.640
Another thing to keep in mind is I imagine a lot of people listening to this podcast

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.200
are not just starting a college program, right?

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:44.400
They're coming from possibly other experiences, other specialties.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.400
You know, what's really good for job security, knowing the intersection of two things, the

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:54.580
intersection of chemistry and programming, the intersection of geology and programming

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.600
for Exxon potentially, right?

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:03.340
Yes, those things take you from a pool of a thousand to a pool of tens.

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:06.240
And so what's awesome about that is it means two things.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:10.940
You don't throw away if you got a degree in something else like biology or whatever, you

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:13.140
don't throw away like, well, that was wasted four years.

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.140
That's out.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.140
Yes.

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:20.540
And it, it slices the pool of people who could apply for certain jobs way, way smaller.

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.540
Right.

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:22.540
Sounds like you agree.

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:25.060
Oh, a thousand percent.

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.880
I'll just tell a quick little anecdote.

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:32.700
When I was at ExxonMobil, there's a lot of not things, things I did not like in ExxonMobil,

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:38.240
but this is something I really liked is about once a quarter, they would do a crowdsourced

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.580
data science competition for the whole organization, like around the entire world.

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:47.380
And they would say, this is a business problem we're trying to solve, you know, and at Exxon,

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.600
we have data scientists all over the world and like all sorts of different teams and

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.600
things like that.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.980
So I like did not know all the data scientists at Exxon and they'd say, this is, this is

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.220
the problem we're facing.

00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:58.220
Here's the data, go.

00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.220
Right.

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:00.220
Nice.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.740
And I loved participating in these.

00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:06.420
It was like right up my, my wheelhouse of like, I really enjoy exploration and all this

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:07.420
stuff.

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.660
At the time I was getting my master's degree, but I didn't have my master's degree and I

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.820
was competing against, so I'm just a chemical engineering grad, right.

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:20.340
And I'm competing against people with PhDs in computer science and in data science and

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:23.520
all these like people who have way more experience than me.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.520
And I actually won a few competitions.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.520
That's awesome.

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.520
I appreciate it.

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:32.360
And it's not because I was a better programmer or a better, better data scientist.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.880
It's because I majored in chemical engineering and I knew the business problem, the domain

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.440
extremely well.

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.840
And I kind of knew the programming and the data science stuff, but the combination of

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.880
them made me very valuable.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:49.780
Like one of the best examples I have is we were looking at crude oil properties.

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:53.120
And I remember like there was a forum where you'd like ask your questions.

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.020
And one of the, one of the data scientists asked, Hey, is sulfur bad?

00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:58.020
There's lots of sulfur in this.

00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.020
Is it bad?

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:02.000
And like to a chemical engineer, that's like the most obvious thing.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
No, you, yes.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.560
Sulfur is very bad in crude oil.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.560
That's very no, no.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:11.640
That's like such a fundamental thing to me and to him or her that was like groundbreaking.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:15.440
And so yeah, your domain can become your superpower in your career.

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:16.440
Yeah.

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:21.660
And it makes it way harder for chat, GPT and other types of tools to just automate you

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:22.660
out of a job.

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:23.660
Right.

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:24.660
Yeah.

00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:28.900
Because you bring in all these skills together, which is awesome, but it also makes it easier

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:29.900
for you to get the job.

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:33.580
It makes it easier for you to continue your momentum of whatever you've been up to.

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:34.980
It's just, it's good all around.

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:35.980
Yeah.

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:40.380
I think it's more fun too, because once again, like when I was trying to decide if I should

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:47.580
study computer science, I was like, man, I don't really want to build a, an Excel workbook

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:49.740
for building an Excel workbook sake.

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:51.500
And that's still true for me today.

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.980
I don't want to do data science for data science sake.

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:58.820
I only like machine learning or data science when I'm doing it to solve a really fun problem

00:55:58.820 --> 00:55:59.820
I'm passionate about.

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.180
That's, that's why it's more fun.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:05.020
So if you can be excited about the domain and excited about the algorithms, I think

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:08.100
that's, that's a great place to be.

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.100
Absolutely agree.

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.100
All right.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:14.380
Well, we're running short on time, but maybe tell us a bit about your data career jump

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:15.380
start.

00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:16.380
Yeah, absolutely.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.380
You've referred to it a couple of times.

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:18.380
Yeah.

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.700
So yeah, I have a company called Data Career Jumpstart.

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.700
I just try to do a lot of education.

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:26.300
So the education happens on LinkedIn, happens on YouTube.

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:29.900
And I actually forgot to mention this at the beginning, but I have my own podcast called

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.900
the Data Career Podcast, where I help people land their first day to job.

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.180
We're about at a hundred episodes.

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:39.220
So not quite the groundwork that you've put in.

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:40.220
That's still a ton.

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.220
That's awesome.

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.020
Yeah, we're, we're getting there.

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:49.220
And then, yeah, I also have a, a, a bootcamp where I try to affordably help people land

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:54.820
their first data analyst position by teaching them the skills, the networking and the project

00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:58.340
and portfolio building that they need to do so.

00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.380
Like the long version of this show.

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:01.380
Yeah, basically.

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:07.300
Well, yeah, just take, take what we talked about today, expand on it, make it like 350

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:10.220
unique lessons, and that's exactly what it is.

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.060
Yeah, very cool.

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:13.060
All right.

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:14.740
Well, we're about out of time.

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:19.980
So maybe just every final, final call to action, you know, people, maybe you're inspired.

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.580
See Diego out in the audience said awesome talk very much.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:26.500
So what's next?

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.820
It's easy to be inspired, but you got to take action.

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.900
Yeah, I love that.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:36.500
I think it's always fun to listen to podcasts, but you probably benefit way more from the

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.940
action you take after a podcast.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:45.060
So for you guys who are maybe interested in a data analytics or a data science career,

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:49.220
explore that if you're like, yes, I'm in, you know, make a plan, make a roadmap.

00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:52.620
If you need help, I have like a webinar that will help you make a roadmap.

00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:53.780
Like what skills should you learn?

00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.700
How should you be networking and stuff like that?

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:58.660
But really probably if you're just getting started trying to figure out what skills you

00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:02.340
should learn, like what are the top skills that you should be learning and then learning

00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:06.020
those skills and then not only learning those skills, but take action and learning and build

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:10.780
some sort of a project that we talked about that you could put on a portfolio, make a

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.460
streamlet app or something like that.

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:15.460
That's probably the best action you could possibly take.

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:20.380
If you need any ideas, advice, feel free to check out my website, datacareerjumpstart.com

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.620
or the podcast data career podcast.

00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.540
Hopefully there's a lots of free resources for you guys to check that out.

00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:28.700
If you've never seen streamlet before, I have some YouTube videos about streamlet that you

00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:30.780
guys can check out, but I love it.

00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:33.420
Just take action somehow, do something.

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.980
Yes.

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:39.540
That's one of the huge, huge differentiators is like you might be inspired, but you just

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:42.300
got to start taking those steps and it becomes a snowball.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:45.980
So thanks for sharing all your experience and your advice.

00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:50.020
Hopefully some people out there are taking action and yeah, I'll put everything we talked

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:51.620
about in the show notes of course.

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:52.620
So thanks for being here Avery.
