00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
(silence)


00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.260
- Hello everyone out there on the live stream.


00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.560
Thank you for joining us here on YouTube


00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.720
for this conversation.


00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.560
It's gonna be super, super fun with Eugene.


00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.800
Hi, Eugene.


00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.640
- Hey, Michael.


00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.460
Good to be here.


00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.400
- Yeah, it's great to have you here.


00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.360
You ready to kick off this podcast?


00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.320
- Let's go.


00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.360
- All right.


00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.320
Eugene, welcome to Talk Python to Me.


00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.400
- Thank you.


00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.000
- Yeah, it's great to have you here.


00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.920
I love getting down into the details of programming


00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.480
and writing code and working with APIs


00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.580
and building amazing things.


00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.000
But it's also really interesting to sort of step back


00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.720
and take a big picture view of the world of the software.


00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.400
And you wrote a really interesting article


00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.320
about applying some of the lessons you might learn


00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.040
from code back to your life.


00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.540
And I really enjoyed the idea of it.


00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.680
So I'm looking forward to talking to you


00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.960
about it on this show.


00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.780
- Thank you.


00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.120
Happy to chat more about it as well.


00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.960
- Yeah, yeah.


00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.120
It's gonna be super fun.


00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.920
Now, before we get into the details of all that,


00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.040
you know, let's start with your story.


00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.120
How'd you get into programming and Python?


00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.040
- Well, I had my degrees in psychology.


00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.760
So since then, I've been really interested


00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.080
in understanding, you know, how people behave,


00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.160
why they think the way they think,


00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.040
and how information changes their perceptions and behavior.


00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.560
So, you know, to do this, I used to run experiments


00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.440
and analyze the data in SPSS and Excel.


00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.360
But eventually in work,


00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.720
the data just got bigger and bigger.


00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.160
So I moved on to R and now I'm using Python.


00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.600
So that's how it happened.


00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.160
I mainly use Python because I have problems to solve


00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.780
that require me to process data with Python.


00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.840
- Yeah, really cool.


00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.200
You know, one of my very first programming jobs


00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.360
was at this incredibly cool place


00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.880
where it started as a research lab


00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.240
and then it's put out of the university to a startup.


00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.920
And the whole premise of what they did


00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.120
was to use eye tracking, not some phone thing,


00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.800
but like where you're looking to understand


00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.280
how people solve problems and how they think and so on.


00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.040
And it was mostly a bunch of PhD cognitive science folks


00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.080
and they would work in MATLAB and Excel and all that stuff.


00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.800
And I would help write software that would take that stuff


00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.880
and turn it into products and turn it into automation


00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.040
and whatnot.


00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.960
It's a really interesting world.


00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.080
And there's a lot more opportunities for code


00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.440
and solving problems with code,


00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.520
especially on the data analysis side in psychology


00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.960
than you might first think, right?


00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.920
You think, oh, psychology,


00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.080
that's talking to people on the couch, like sometimes,


00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.000
but not always, not a lot of the time.


00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.840
- You're right.


00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.360
A lot of it is running experiments


00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.400
and like I'm sure they collect the data,


00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280
but I try to get any of the process data


00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.520
and that happens in real life as well.


00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.400
We run experiments, maybe testing,


00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.640
and we have to analyze the data.


00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.720
- Yeah, that was it.


00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.480
We would run tons of experiments.


00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.440
We would have maybe a week where 50 people came in


00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.000
and we'd have like one-way mirrors


00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.200
and all sorts of recording equipment and like analyze.


00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.040
They'd even put ads, I think in Craigslist,


00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.880
all sorts of places, like,


00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.480
"Hey, we need somebody to come like surf


00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.280
"on these websites for half an hour.


00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.120
"We'll pay you 50 bucks.


00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.240
"Can you come do that during lunch?"


00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.960
Be like, "Yeah, I'll do that."


00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.160
- That's really cool.


00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.040
- Yeah, it was really fun,


00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.800
but it was really neat to do the programming


00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.640
and stuff there.


00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.680
So yeah, I mean, tell me a little bit more


00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.600
about that transition,


00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.360
because it must have been a little bit challenging, right?


00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.760
There's not a lot in your like traditional education


00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.920
of psychology that teaches you programming,


00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.160
maybe a little bit, but not a ton, right?


00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.120
- No, actually, in my traditional education,


00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.320
for psychology, we use SPSS and R.


00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.400
SPSS is this IBM product, proprietary.


00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.320
So nothing about it.


00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.800
I did know a bit about the statistics


00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.560
and how to work with data, but that's about it.


00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.560
So I think back then,


00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.080
when I first started getting my first job,


00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.520
I had to learn a lot of Python and SQL on my own.


00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.920
And that was the time when Coursera was available.


00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.640
And Coursera is a lifesaver.


00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.560
If you ask me, I learned all my Python


00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.360
and data science stuff from Coursera.


00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.200
So it was, after work, spending one or two hours


00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.680
doing the courses and doing the lessons,


00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.320
the hands-on exercises were amazing.


00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.040
And today, nowadays, you have so much


00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.720
available Python resources to help you quickly pick up,


00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.360
get something working, iterate on something, fix the bugs,


00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.880
and have something that you can play with.


00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.880
And it just makes it so fun to learn Python now.


00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.720
- Yeah.


00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.800
There's so much to know in programming these days,


00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.280
but at the same time,


00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.520
there's so many resources out there to help you.


00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.120
It's really a huge benefit.


00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.480
I remember when MOOCs,


00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.040
the MOOCs came on, as they called them,


00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.000
like these courses with many, many, many people in them.


00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And it was such a revolution at the time.


00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.920
And now it's just one of the million options.


00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.880
- Yep, I agree.


00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.760
I think MOOCs are really the great equalizer.


00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.440
I mean, education is the great equalizer.


00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.560
And MOOCs, by making it freely available


00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.560
across the internet with great educators,


00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.800
can just teach anyone and not confine to a classroom.


00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.880
I think that was amazing.


00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.640
And that was what helped me transition


00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.160
from SPSS and R to Python and Spark and machine learning.


00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.400
It opened that door for me.


00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.240
- Yeah, yeah.


00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.440
Instead of studying neurons,


00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.720
you're studying neural networks now.


00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.560
- Yeah.


00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.400
- Nice.


00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.240
So how about now?


00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.080
What do you do day to day?


00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.040
You just made a big life change.


00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.680
I was reading that you recently moved


00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.680
from Singapore to Seattle.


00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.520
That's a big change, even though,


00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.880
not a whole lot in between those two things,


00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.200
if you draw a line, just a lot of water.


00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.360
But yeah, a big change in terms of jobs and whatnot.


00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.760
Tell us about that.


00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.000
- So I think towards the end of 2019,


00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.040
I think, or maybe in the middle of 2019,


00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.920
my wife and I were thinking of stepping out


00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.600
of our comfort zone.


00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.880
I don't know how many of your listeners


00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.080
have been to Singapore, but it's a beautiful place.


00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.640
It's a very comfortable, tiny island, amazing weather.


00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.120
But we thought, we like to travel.


00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.440
So we thought, hey, let's try to live somewhere for a bit.


00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.040
So we looked at a couple of places,


00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.120
a couple of tech hubs,


00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.000
Seattle, San Francisco, Berlin, Shanghai.


00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And it so happens that I got an offer from Amazon.


00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.800
So that's where I am now.


00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.520
I'm an applied scientist in Amazon.


00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.200
And so what I do, I'm part of the Kindle team.


00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.800
So what I do in my day-to-day job


00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.680
is I try to help people read more.


00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.360
And we try to do this by helping them find books


00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.560
that they need to find.


00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.720
So what I do is I work on recommendation engines


00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.320
to try to help people, as you're finding a book,


00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.560
or based on what you have read,


00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.080
to the extent that you have read it,


00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.080
we know this because we have Kindle data.


00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.760
We know how much of a book we have completed.


00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.440
We can recommend you new books


00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.680
that you might be interested in.


00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.200
Or based on what you browse on the website,


00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.680
we can update our recommendations in real time


00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.400
and recommend you new books as well.


00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.560
So that's what I do in my day-to-day job.


00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.680
- Yeah, well, that sounds really fun.


00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.640
I actually really appreciate that from Amazon,


00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.480
specifically around the Kindle, to be honest.


00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.560
A lot of stores are like, "Oh, you might also like that."


00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.760
I'm like, "No, I don't also like that.


00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.320
"I really don't care."


00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.800
There's just so many things


00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.480
where I'm shopping online or whatever,


00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.560
and it just doesn't make sense.


00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.080
But specifically for Kindle, I'll be reading a book


00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.080
and it'll say, "You should also check out these other ones."


00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.720
A lot of times, my next book is out of that list.


00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.600
I really love it.


00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.480
So you can't go browse a bookstore these days.


00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.720
I mean, we have a fantastic bookstore called Pals.


00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.800
It's one of the largest bookstores around here in Portland,


00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.520
but you can't even go to it anymore.


00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.080
So yeah, that's pretty cool.


00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.480
So thanks for that good list there, you and your folks.


00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.680
- I'm happy to hear that.


00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.960
Yeah, this is a great place where what I'm doing


00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.280
is very aligned with what I do,


00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.360
which is trying to help people,


00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.400
very aligned with my values,


00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.520
which is trying to help people learn more


00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.640
by reading more books.


00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.480
So that's great.


00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.240
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.760
And you talk a lot about writing.


00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.440
And well, I guess not just talk,


00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.840
you also put your time and energy where your words are.


00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.720
You do a lot of writing.


00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.600
And the reason that I wanted to talk to you about,


00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.920
I have you on the show, like I said,


00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.640
is one of these articles that you wrote,


00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.520
but there's a whole bunch of them that you have.


00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.520
So there's a couple of people who are really successful


00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.040
in the tech field that I can think of


00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.280
who really make writing an important part


00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.800
of what they're doing.


00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.560
Like I had Jesse Giroud-Davis on the podcast


00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.920
at the time he's from MongoDB, I think he still is.


00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.440
Anyway, he talks about like all these design patterns


00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.320
of technical writing, right?


00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.520
Like here's the how-to, here's the first,


00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.960
and like all these really interesting things.


00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.420
And I kind of get that vibe from you as well,


00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.100
that like you've got these really strong ideas


00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.420
about writing and how it reinforces


00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.800
your programming side of the world.


00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.240
What's your thoughts on that?


00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.400
- Well, I like it.


00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.160
I guess maybe just to share a bit of backstory


00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.440
about why I started writing so much.


00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.920
I think a couple of years ago,


00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.840
I was interviewing a couple of mentors,


00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.920
informal mentors, right?


00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.640
They didn't know I was getting them to be a mentor,


00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.080
but I would just reach out to people


00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.040
who are two to three steps ahead of me,


00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.680
heads of data science, CTOs, lead data scientists.


00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.240
I would ask them the same question,


00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.320
what makes an effective data scientist?


00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.560
And I would say, is it understanding


00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.840
the business domain deeply,


00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.680
or is it PhD research level skills,


00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.560
ninja hacking skills, Python or C++ or Java?


00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.240
And a lot of them said,


00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.560
actually, all that is really important,


00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.720
but there's one thing that you're missing out.


00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.960
And this one thing is transferable


00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.920
across all your entire career.


00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.040
And that one thing they said is communication.


00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.100
At that point in time, I didn't believe it.


00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.940
I was immature.


00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.800
I didn't think it was, I didn't think it makes sense,


00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.000
but I thought, so many of these people tried it.


00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.760
I owe it to them to, so many of these people mentioned,


00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.280
I owe it to them to try it and update my progress.


00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.120
So for one year, I said,


00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.600
I'm just gonna volunteer for whatever writing opportunity,


00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.240
whatever speaking opportunity the company has.


00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.040
So I started writing about my side projects.


00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.480
I started writing an internal company newsletter


00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.960
to share about what our team,


00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.440
our data science team was doing.


00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.040
And I started speaking at conferences and meetups.


00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.160
And so that's why I started writing.


00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.120
And since then, I found that writing


00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.840
actually helps me learn a lot


00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.480
because I would write about something and I realized,


00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.800
hey, I don't know anything


00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.400
about this thing I'm writing about.


00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.840
So I'm forced to do that. - Exactly.


00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.680
- Yeah, you're right.


00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.920
- You think you know,


00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.640
you've learned enough to sort of have some thoughts


00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.060
or in the programming space,


00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.460
you can maybe get something to work, right?


00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.640
But if you've got to explain it,


00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.160
all of a sudden it's not enough to know,


00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.280
well, there's two ways and I can just use that way.


00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.320
You've got to know, well, here's the two ways.


00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.600
What are the trade-offs?


00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.000
When should I use which?


00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.760
Like you got to dive into these sorts of details


00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.360
when you're either writing or speaking


00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.480
or presenting about it.


00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.360
And it just forces you another level down


00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.920
in your understanding and depth, right?


00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.720
- Exactly, writing is really difficult.


00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.160
And truth be told, I think a lot of people say,


00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.720
you know, you must really love writing.


00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.440
No, actually, I don't really love writing,


00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.720
which is a bit weird.


00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.240
I love learning and I love sharing


00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.920
about what I've learned online.


00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.520
And writing is my vehicle to let me do that.


00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.360
- Yeah.


00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.880
- So that's why I started writing.


00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.280
So why do I talk a lot about writing at work


00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.760
or writing in general?


00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.800
There's this question that I ask myself a lot.


00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.040
I used to ask myself this question


00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.560
and now a lot of people ask me this question.


00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.480
Hey, you know, as a data scientist,


00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.880
is your job to write code


00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.040
or is your job to write documents?


00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.040
And I used to think my job was to write code,


00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.640
to build systems, to help customers.


00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.160
But then as I'm doing this more,


00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.280
I find that, hey, you know, a lot of times


00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.680
before writing code, I need to spend a lot of time


00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.720
thinking, researching and designing.


00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.400
And the medium of that work is writing documents.


00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.880
That's why I encourage a lot of people, you know,


00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.240
by, so it's just like what you said,


00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.840
hey, you know, do I serve my recommendations


00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.520
via Redis cache or via Lambda or API gateway or whatever?


00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.200
And I'm thinking through all these designs


00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.680
and I need to make trade-offs.


00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.760
And writing in a document, the pros and cons


00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.880
and the rationale for the decision forces me to do that.


00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.680
So that when we start implementing things,


00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.880
we don't do things the wrong way,


00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.000
which is really expensive, right?


00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.160
Implementation is expensive.


00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.880
So that's why, and I find that


00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.080
it has really helped me a lot.


00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.280
I don't feel that enough people talk about it


00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.920
and I want to encourage people to write a lot as well.


00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.120
- Well, yeah, I agree.


00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.440
And it seems to me like one of the fundamental jobs


00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.920
of a data scientist, at least one branch of data science


00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.840
is to take the raw information, think about it


00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.360
and then communicate what it means, right?


00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.080
And that seems to go really hand in hand


00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.400
with what you're saying.


00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.200
- Exactly, I think, so there was once,


00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.240
so, you know, so I was doing this one year of writing


00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.520
and speaking practice, right, at work.


00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.920
And then in the past, I had people come up to me


00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.000
and say that, "You know, Eugene,


00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
every time I have a meeting with the data scientists


00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.280
on your team for half an hour,


00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.080
and then I walk away not knowing anything.


00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.720
I don't know what they spoke about."


00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.400
And that's because I think by and large,


00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.480
most people, you know, we tend to use jargon


00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.880
like AUC, ROC, distributed, all that.


00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.480
And we assume that business people know it.


00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.880
But I made this mistake as well.


00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.560
And then one day I had a great boss who brought me aside,


00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.960
you know, "Eugene, the way you're communicating,


00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.360
no one understands you."


00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.640
And I asked, "What do you mean?"


00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.640
And he gave me very good feedback.


00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.080
He was a great boss and I started changing


00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.280
how I communicated things.


00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.280
And that made me a lot more effective at work.


00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.480
So that's how I get started on that.


00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.680
- Oh, fantastic.


00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.080
Well, I really like what you've done


00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.240
with the writing and stuff.


00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.600
And so, you know, maybe let's spend some time


00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.840
diving into the one that I think is probably


00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.080
the centerpiece of what we'll talk about.


00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.120
We'll touch on a few other ones


00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.360
because you do a really good job in your writing


00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.320
of not just putting down your thoughts,


00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.320
but bringing other people's ideas and influences in there.


00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.520
So you have a lot of quotes,


00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.840
you have a lot of references to other things and so on.


00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.520
So yeah, I really like the way, the style.


00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.480
So let's talk about, you know, your article,


00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.880
"What Machine Learning Can Teach Us About Life,


00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.920
Seven Lessons."


00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.640
What was the, why did you write this?


00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.240
- Well, you know, because when I was writing


00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.360
some of my previous articles, I like to,


00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.440
okay, this is an odd thing.


00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.000
I know that my audience are machine learning practitioners.


00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.600
And, you know, sometimes I write about things


00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.440
that sometimes I want to write about things


00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.600
that I know will not interest them.


00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.440
So this is one of those.


00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.520
I like to write about life lessons, right?


00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.320
And I know it will not interest them,


00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.320
but I think it's really important.


00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.960
I want to write about that anyway.


00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.720
So, you know, in order to sneak it in,


00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.040
in this case, machine learning


00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.440
is really just a Trojan horse.


00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.560
Machine learning is a Trojan horse


00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.320
where I sneak in this life lessons


00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.360
that I found really helpful for me.


00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.640
And I just, you know, upon some reflection,


00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.320
I just want to write about it.


00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.280
And that's it.


00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.280
That's how this article came about.


00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.240
- Okay. Yeah.


00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.080
Interesting.


00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.040
I love these Trojan horse ideas.


00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.000
Like, ah, I'm going to teach you.


00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.840
I'll do something fun.


00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.160
I'll actually have a lesson, right?


00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.160
- Yeah. And now the secret's out.


00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.440
Yeah. I haven't actually shared anyone.


00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.720
- Now they're going to know.


00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.800
That's right.


00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.680
So let's, let's go through the seven lessons.


00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.200
The first one here is data cleaning.


00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.520
Assess what you consume.


00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.720
And I'm a big fan of this idea


00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.080
as a life lesson as well.


00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.920
So what's the story?


00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.760
Wait, before you get into that,


00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.960
like every one of these lessons,


00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.800
you start by saying, okay,


00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.760
here's the machine learning meaning.


00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.320
And then here's the sort of follow on lesson, right?


00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.400
So what's the machine learning lesson of data cleaning?


00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.600
- I think the machine learning lesson of data cleaning is,


00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.000
most machine learning practitioners would know


00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.480
when you use noisy data,


00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.400
your machine learning model is going to be noisy


00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.560
and it's just not going to work.


00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.560
I think there's this cliche,


00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.560
garbage in, garbage out.


00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.520
In machine learning world,


00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.120
that is absolutely true.


00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.480
And cleaning the data itself


00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.840
is actually most of the work


00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.800
in terms of training your model,


00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.000
cleaning your data, refining it,


00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.840
making the model be able to learn from it.


00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.000
So that's really important in the machine learning world.


00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.120
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.600
So yeah, you have a really interesting quote in here


00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.640
and you also have some really fun pictures,


00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.760
which we can talk about.


00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.840
Where is it in here?


00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.520
It was, yeah, as Randy Al shares,


00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.760
data cleaning isn't the grunt work,


00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.600
it is the work, right?


00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.600
- Yeah.


00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.440
- Yeah.


00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.240
I think so many of these things


00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.520
in a lot of these machine learning


00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.840
and scientific programming sides,


00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.440
you have these amazing libraries, right?


00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.640
Like you can pip install in TensorFlow or whatever,


00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.680
and then you just feed the data.


00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.080
You got your data frame, you feed it over, boom,


00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.560
and like magic happens.


00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.160
But it's, right, you've got to get that data,


00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.360
you've got to format the data,


00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.360
you've got to convert the data.


00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.520
You got to understand that it's all correct, right?


00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.040
There's cool libraries like expectations


00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.880
that are like sort of unit tests for your data


00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.840
to make sure you don't feed in bad data and all that.


00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.920
But yeah, I mean, I agree with that statement a lot.


00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.600
That's pretty neat.


00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.920
- Thank you, and I link to Randy Al's post,


00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.360
which is a very good post.


00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.920
I think he wrote that,


00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.760
of course I might be putting words into his mouth,


00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.160
but I think he wrote that


00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.800
because a lot of people think that data preparation


00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.200
is not sexy data cleaning, it's just grunt work.


00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.520
And he's trying to get people, to remind people,


00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.600
no, actually it is the work.


00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.760
It is what actually makes a big difference


00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.200
in your analysis outcomes, in your machine learning outcomes.


00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.120
And I fully agree.


00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.000
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.960
All right, so life lesson from this one?


00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.240
What's the parallel life lesson you were trying to draw?


00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.200
- Well, the main life lesson that I was trying to draw


00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.880
is actually the one below that image.


00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.400
- So you have a really fantastic image


00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.600
and you talk a little bit about food first


00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.440
before you get into what I think is more important,


00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.680
although food is not unimportant.


00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.920
But we've all seen these horrible pictures


00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.200
of like the fifties and sixties


00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.880
of doctors recommending cigarettes.


00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.360
Like my doctor recommends Camel, not Marlboro.


00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.080
You're like, oh my God, what is this?


00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.480
But there's like this really similar one for sugar.


00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.360
I have like all these, like, you know,


00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.440
here's like, how do you, you don't get overweight.


00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.280
You eat your sugar so you don't eat fatty food.


00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.280
Oh my gosh.


00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.000
Anyway, so yeah, that's one is food,


00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.840
which is really interesting,


00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.080
but then more importantly is news, right?


00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.280
- So if you could just go up to the image,


00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.480
just so in this image, right,


00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.200
we see that food is important and, you know,


00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.200
bad food actually makes you bad, makes you unhealthy.


00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.600
But in this image,


00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.680
this image is both bad food and bad information.


00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.440
There's so much bad information out there on Twitter,


00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.480
on Facebook or social media.


00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.760
And you really have to be careful


00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.520
about what you consume, right?


00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.040
Misinformation, I mean, it's really easy to consume,


00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.000
you know, this small 200 character tweets


00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.600
or, you know, small empty calorie.


00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.840
I like to call them empty calories on social media.


00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.680
You know, there's--


00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.960
- Empty calorie info bites, you call them, that's great.


00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.840
- Yeah, there's, you know,


00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.360
some influencers who post really short things


00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.880
and, you know, they just go viral.


00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.320
And, but if you consume a lot,


00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.440
it actually, you think about,


00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.560
hey, did that actually change my life?


00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.480
No, it's actually kind of empty calories.


00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.160
And a lot of good writers,


00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.840
David Perrell writes about this,


00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.400
it's like, you want your content to be very niche,


00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.040
very deep, very high in nutrition.


00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.640
So I think that's the same thing


00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.600
when you consume light content,


00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.440
you don't actually gain a lot.


00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.360
It can be actually downright toxic.


00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.520
A lot of times it's like content is just one statement,


00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.480
you know, trying to sway information, sway the public.


00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.080
So I think for your own sake,


00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.320
curate what you consume.


00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.680
- I agree, I mean, it's so important


00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.520
and it has so many knock-on effects, right?


00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.640
And it also has some interesting machine learning tie-ins,


00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.400
I would say here, some recommendation engine tie-ins.


00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.240
I think maybe it's,


00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.680
I'm not a hundred percent sure about the attribution,


00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.760
but I think Tony Robbins said,


00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.120
"You've got to be the guardian of your own mind," right?


00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.840
You've got to consciously decide what you let in,


00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.680
what thoughts you let influence you


00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.040
and what ones you just, you know,


00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.040
eject and say, this doesn't matter.


00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.880
- Definitely.


00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.480
- What you think can really affect you.


00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.640
But I was thinking even more,


00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.160
like if I go onto YouTube and I start to consume some,


00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.920
a little kind of crummy, but whatever,


00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.960
the very next thing is, you know,


00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.280
you're never intense enough for YouTube.


00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.000
If you watch three videos on one topic,


00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.600
like it's like you need a hundred more of these videos.


00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.640
Right? - Yeah.


00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.160
- It's just like, so with a lot of social media,


00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.560
I don't use Facebook enough, but I can imagine it's similar.


00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.280
Like as you start to trend even a little bit in one way


00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.800
or the other, it just throws you a huge rope


00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.600
and tries to pull you hard, you know,


00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.160
for the sake of engagement down that path.


00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.800
And so small curves these days seem to matter a lot more.


00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.400
Like if you used to like grab, I don't know,


00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.640
some crummy newspaper, like a rumor newspaper


00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.960
at the grocery store and read it,


00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.400
then you went back and you read the New York Times


00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.400
when you got home.


00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.200
The New York Times wouldn't just stop showing you


00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.760
the important news, it would,


00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.360
and show you all sorts of junk because you read the,


00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.880
but nowadays that's what happens.


00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.720
It's crazy.


00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.440
- It is.


00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.240
And I think a lot of it is because of just how


00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.080
machine learning works.


00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.640
If you click on something and you read something,


00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.200
it thinks that you like that thing


00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.360
and it recommends you more of that thing.


00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.240
- Yeah.


00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.040
- Which sometimes it's just a, you misclick or something


00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040
and sometimes it's a mistake.


00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.560
And that's why machine learning and social media


00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.880
can sort of polarize people,


00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.280
which is not what we want to do.


00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.440
So it really takes, you need to be conscious


00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.240
about how you're affected by it.


00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.080
- Right.


00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.000
Obviously your article is not about this,


00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.160
but we're going to have to reckon with this as a society.


00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.000
- Definitely.


00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.960
- Period, in a big way.


00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.120
But let's go on to lesson number two,


00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.920
low versus high signal data


00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.640
and seeking to disconfirm and update.


00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.800
Tell us about this one.


00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.200
- So maybe I'll start with the machine learning aspect.


00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.160
I think, so what I'm trying,


00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.840
what this here is a support vector machine.


00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.480
So you're trying to separate the blue dots


00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.480
from the red dots.


00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.760
And on the left most image.


00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.920
- Yeah, let me, yeah, go ahead and just describe it real quick


00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.760
'cause most people are just listening.


00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.960
- Yeah, I mean, on the left most image,


00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.840
I mean, it's very easy to separate, right?


00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.360
So you can see the margin is very wide.


00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.240
The margin is the dash line,


00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.120
the distance from the dash line to the solid line.


00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.440
But then on the middle image,


00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.000
all of a sudden we introduce a new red dot


00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.880
and the margin becomes very narrow.


00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.920
So, you know, your certainty is a lot less


00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.760
and you start to think, hey, you know,


00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.120
maybe I'm less certain.


00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.120
And then on the right,


00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.320
and then you start to collect more information,


00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.320
more data points around there.


00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.480
And then all of a sudden your margin


00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.320
becomes a curve margin.


00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.600
So what you thought was true


00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.040
and you were very certain about it


00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.840
on the left side of the image,


00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.360
now suddenly changes.


00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.400
- Yeah, you get a little bit more information


00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.960
and you're like, oh, this is not the dividing line


00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.000
or the distinction at all.


00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.840
It's totally more nuanced or whatever, yeah?


00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.160
- Exactly, so I know I shouldn't be referring


00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.800
to the image because this is a podcast,


00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.040
but I think the image is really powerful


00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.400
in terms of how in machine learning


00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.160
you change your decision boundaries.


00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.720
And in real life, this is the same.


00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.280
So I think Jeff Bezos has a very powerful quote


00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.800
that says, I think something like this,


00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.760
that says that, I actually didn't put it here,


00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.840
but I'm just reminded of it that says that,


00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.440
hey, you know, when data disagrees with anecdotes,


00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.840
he tends to prefer the anecdotes


00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.880
because a lot of times it sort of means


00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.080
that maybe you're measuring things wrongly.


00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.960
So data is very easy to collect.


00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.880
We have a lot of data, but whereas anecdotes


00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.320
is one or two of those feedback points


00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.320
that disagrees and we sort of need to jump


00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.560
into an anecdote, collect more data around it.


00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.960
So I think this is the same thing.


00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.520
And when you're asking for feedback,


00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.040
often people give you good feedback,


00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.400
you know, you're doing great,


00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.320
continue what you're doing, you're doing fantastic.


00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.600
And when people give you bad feedback, dig into it.


00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.440
That is a gift for you to improve, dig into it.


00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.640
Ask them, hey, you know, I love what you just said.


00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.440
Can you give me more detail?


00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.000
And so it's giving you more detail,


00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.240
more information on how you should be thinking,


00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.240
how you should be designing,


00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.400
how your code should change in your code reviews.


00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.760
And it helps you grow.


00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.840
- Yeah.


00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.080
I think, especially in the US,


00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.200
people are very uncomfortable with negative feedback,


00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.680
both giving and receiving it.


00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.800
But yeah, if it's given in the right way,


00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.680
it can be very valuable.


00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.640
I mean, maybe listening to like what people put


00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.840
on your YouTube video,


00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.640
that might not be all that constructive.


00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.040
There's a lot of weird, just people with issues at scale.


00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.000
But yeah, I totally agree.


00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.080
And you know, some more closed space, right?


00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.480
Like a code review or something, right?


00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.960
That's definitely an opportunity to learn something,


00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.520
even if the person is wrong,


00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.320
it's still an opportunity to learn their perspective


00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.280
and learn from it, right?


00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.760
So one of the quotes you have in the section


00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.160
is by Karl Popper,


00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.680
"True ignorance is not the absence of knowledge,


00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.520
"but the refusal to acquire it."


00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.800
And I think that also goes hand in hand


00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.400
with the polarization and stuff you talked about before.


00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.240
- Yeah, I agree.


00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.720
I think that I adopt the growth mindset.


00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.680
I think that people can change, can grow.


00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.480
And that's what's necessary, right?


00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.080
In our industry, right?


00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.960
Things change so fast.


00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.320
So we have to keep,


00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.440
try to keep up with the times in terms of the technology.


00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.760
I think fundamentally we should focus on the problems,


00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.040
but don't neglect how technology is changing as well.


00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.080
- For sure.


00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.600
All right, number three, explore, exploit.


00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.720
Balance for the greater long-term reward.


00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.960
So it has to do with reinforcement learning, right?


00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.320
- Yeah, so in reinforcement learning,


00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.240
well, we can imagine that at a start,


00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.200
you don't know anything about the state of the world, right?


00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.400
Let's say you have two, this is an example for me.


00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.480
Let's say you have a restaurant that you love.


00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.680
And let's say you first land in Seattle.


00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.800
When I first landed in Seattle, I didn't know where to eat.


00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.080
I didn't know what was good.


00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.360
And I would explore many different restaurants,


00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.080
many different takeouts.


00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.880
And after exploring, after maybe I explored 10 of them,


00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.080
I found that, hey, this place is great.


00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.520
It's cheap, it's nearby, the food is solid.


00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.880
And I would just exploit it all the time.


00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.800
- Exactly, like in my neighborhood,


00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.800
there's maybe two or three Thai food restaurants


00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.800
that I always go to.


00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.600
And if somebody says, "Hey, let's get some Thai food."


00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.800
I'm not gonna go, "Well, there's another one


00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.640
we haven't tried yet.


00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.480
Let's go to..."


00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.320
It's just like, "Nope, that one's good.


00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.160
We'll go in here."


00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.360
You know what I mean?


00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.560
- I am exactly like that.


00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.920
I'm such a lazy thinker.


00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.440
And I just like, "This is really good.


00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.040
It fits my appetite.


00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.320
It fits my taste and it's cheap.


00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.440
Why do we have to try something new?"


00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.240
But thankfully, my wife is an explorer.


00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.400
So while I'm exploiting, she encourages me,


00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.920
"Let's explore these new things."


00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.280
And sometimes I find treasure gems


00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.840
that I would never have tried,


00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.840
but because she's encouraging me to explore, I found it.


00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.440
So that's the balance.


00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.000
So at the start of your career,


00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.240
or at the start when you are trying to solve a new problem,


00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.960
explore, take some time to explore as much as you can.


00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.560
But then once you find it, exploit.


00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.200
But as you're exploiting,


00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.520
don't forget to also be exploring a bit.


00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.840
- Yeah.


00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.960
Yeah, so you tie this back to careers a lot,


00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.680
about basically, as you sort of touched on,


00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.600
continuous learning and don't get too comfortable.


00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.880
And just go with,


00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.960
don't just fall all the way into the exploiting side.


00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.000
Like, "I went to college.


00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.720
I got my engineering degree.


00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.480
Why do I need to learn Jupyter?


00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.960
I'm just gonna keep using MATLAB or Excel,


00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.760
and we're just gonna keep working on this building


00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.840
or bridge or whatever."


00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.560
Like, I think it's easy to do that.


00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.240
I spent the time and the money and worked hard


00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.120
and got good grades and a four-year degree.


00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.520
Like, why do I need, I'm done with tests and learning.


00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.680
I can just stop, right?


00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.640
- Exactly.


00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.880
I was just gonna say the exact same,


00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.800
a very similar example.


00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.880
I study SPSS and R in college.


00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.240
Why do I need to learn Python?


00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.440
Well, Python has a lot of benefits.


00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.920
It's a lot faster, truth be told.


00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.720
And then now that I learned Python, I know SQL.


00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.440
Why do I need to learn Spark?


00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.360
But if you explore a bit,


00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.000
it can really help you make your work a lot more effective.


00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.480
Maybe I know decision trees and linear regressions.


00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.520
Do I really need neural networks?


00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.680
But it's always taking some time to explore


00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.840
what might be new.


00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.360
Sometimes some of this exploration doesn't work out,


00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.520
and that's fine.


00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.800
At least if you think of it from a learning perspective,


00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.840
you're learning a lot.


00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:28.120
But you take the time to sample around every now and then.


00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.280
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.160
You have a couple of great quotes in here


00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.480
from two people I find both of them very interesting.


00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.360
Naval, just a Silicon Valley guy


00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.960
that just goes by Naval, N-A-V-A-L.


00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.320
And he has a really interesting tweet storm


00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.960
that turned into a podcast series


00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.320
and some interesting thinking.


00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.800
Are you familiar with this?


00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.400
- Yes, I love that.


00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.240
Yeah.


00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.520
- Yeah, I do too, actually.


00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.040
It made reading your articles and stuff remind me of that.


00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.960
But he says, "Your goal in life is to find out


00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.600
the people who need you the most,


00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.920
to find out the businesses that need you the most,


00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.920
to find the projects and the art that need you the most."


00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.120
There's something out there for you.


00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:15.120
And then Matthew McConaughey talks about


00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.400
when he was in law school


00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.800
and decided to go into film school,


00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.800
which is obviously a big career switch as somebody.


00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.720
And he's like, "No, no, I have to do this," right?


00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.160
And he was afraid of what his dad would say.


00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.360
And instead of saying, "You've thrown away your career,"


00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.240
or whatever, he just said, "Don't half-ass it.


00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.320
If you're gonna do this, you better go do it," right?


00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.160
So that's sort of the,


00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.120
Naval's is the explore,


00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.760
and McConaughey's, maybe it's the exploit.


00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.840
Like once you're in it, go in it full.


00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.360
- Exactly.


00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.200
So I think that being said,


00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.280
I mean, a lot of us,


00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.760
maybe we are a couple of years in our careers,


00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.960
but I think what Naval tries to remind us,


00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.840
you might not be very happy what you're doing right now,


00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.920
or you might love what you're doing right now,


00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.920
but there's always something that suits you specifically.


00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.000
So some people might love research


00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.320
and they might not fit into a startup environment.


00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:18.320
Or some people, for example, maybe a big innovation lab,


00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.280
they need some of their data scientists


00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.720
to really focus on research.


00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.800
And they might not fit in there


00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.760
if the data scientist is more about iterating fast


00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.960
and shipping fast to customers.


00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.880
So there's always something better for you.


00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.480
So keep exploring.


00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.680
And once you found it,


00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.040
exploit it like Matthew McConaughey.


00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.760
He did a half-ass it, he went all in,


00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.160
and he's doing fantastic.


00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.600
- It worked out okay for him, yeah?


00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.960
- Yeah. (laughs)


00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.120
- Nice, all right.


00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.920
Transfer learning, books and papers are cheat codes.


00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:50.560
- Yeah, so in machine learning,


00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.800
I think a couple of years ago,


00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.920
there was this thing called transfer learning,


00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.840
which it didn't make quite a storm,


00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.240
but I thought it was really breakthrough.


00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.320
So what it means is that there's this competition


00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.080
called ImageNet, where you try to classify images


00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.760
into thousands of categories, I think 1,000 categories.


00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.360
And those big companies like Google, Microsoft,


00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.200
they would train huge models to classify this.


00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.320
And this would be deep neural networks.


00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.800
And what people found is that you can take


00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.840
what they have trained, this huge model


00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.320
with all the weights and parameters,


00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.400
and you can just chop off the last layer,


00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.520
and put your own model,


00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.800
maybe you're trying to classify cat versus dog,


00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.200
you can use that model and then classify cat versus dog


00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.960
and put in your own data and just update the model,


00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.440
and it would work fantastically well.


00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.480
And orders of magnitude better than


00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.120
if you had to train from scratch.


00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.600
I think that's a cheat code.


00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.800
When I first heard about it, I used that cheat code.


00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.120
Okay, since I've heard about it,


00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.720
I've only used transfer learning for work as much as I can.


00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.440
- Yeah, so the idea is you,


00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.160
instead of starting with a completely blank set of weights


00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.840
in your model, and just feeding data and going,


00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.000
no, that's right, that's not right,


00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
that's a dog, that's not a cat.


00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.040
No, that's, yes, that one is a cat, good job.


00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.280
You can use kind of a vague one


00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.440
to automate some of that driving.


00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.280
Is that kind of the idea?


00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.360
Like you give it a little bit of knowledge,


00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.120
but not too much, and then you keep still teaching it.


00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.560
- Is that this model is able to distinguish


00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.880
a thousand different cats and dogs,


00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.800
and hamburgers, and cars,


00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.920
and you're just taking all that knowledge that's in there,


00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.000
and you're just fine-tuning it


00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.720
for your specific use case of cat versus dog.


00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.000
And it really cuts out so much effort.


00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.680
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.520
Very, very cool.


00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.980
So in this one, the life lesson here is,


00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.360
I think, we were touching on this before,


00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.840
that people feel like a lot of times


00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.920
they've gotten, they've got their degree,


00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.400
they've studied, they've worked hard.


00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.960
Like they just wanna have fun and live their life


00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.800
and not just keep going.


00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.160
But like the way to think of education,


00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.560
formalized education, let's say,


00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.560
even I would say college,


00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.760
is this generalized pre-training, right?


00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.400
You're not ready to really go do the thing.


00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.440
You haven't really learned the thing,


00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.360
but you're much closer than somebody who hasn't, right?


00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.320
Something like that?


00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.480
School, generalized pre-training.


00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.440
- Yes, I fully agree.


00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.360
I think a lot of people think that,


00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.960
at least what I've seen,


00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.400
some people see that after they graduated,


00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.600
I'm done, I'm done learning.


00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.160
But I don't know about you,


00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.360
but after I graduated,


00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.400
after I got into working world,


00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.760
I realized, hey, I didn't learn any of this stuff


00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.600
in the working world.


00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.840
I had to learn a lot more.


00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.680
Almost none.


00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.280
I think the only thing that I learned at school


00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.960
that helped was Excel and R and SPSS,


00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.360
the technical skills.


00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.120
So school sort of trains you,


00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.160
teamwork, how to work in a project team,


00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.280
communication, how to learn fast,


00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.000
because every semester you're taking four subjects.


00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.280
It teaches you the general stuff.


00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.280
And then once you get to work,


00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.600
there's a lot of online,


00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.960
there's a lot of on-the-job training


00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.520
that you have to do yourself.


00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.800
So the point that I was trying to make here


00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.880
is that school is really just the start of it,


00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.320
is generalized pre-training.


00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.480
You could stop there,


00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.720
but if you fine tune,


00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.160
if you take the effort to fine tune your model from school


00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.280
onto yours very specific tasks,


00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.960
you will be orders of magnitude more effective.


00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.520
That's the message I'm trying to give.


00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.080
And I also want to tell people,


00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.320
and this is the next paragraph,


00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.800
is that we have transfer learning models, right?


00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.120
And in real life,


00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.880
that's the same thing for transfer learning models,


00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.760
which is books and academic papers.


00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.040
I want to try to get people to read more books.


00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.800
I've gained a lot from books.


00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.280
I've gained a lot from academic papers.


00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.280
And you can imagine, I don't know,


00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.000
maybe you read a book by, I don't know,


00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.120
Sapiens by Noah Harari,


00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.600
or Deep Work by Cal Newport,


00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.160
who I'm a big fan of.


00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.320
They have thought about this,


00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.400
or on the Navelle's track, right?


00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.120
They have thought about this for so long,


00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.120
five years, decades,


00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.840
and they've compressed it in a book


00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.560
that you can read in eight to 10 hours.


00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.600
Read it, and you'll be that much smarter.


00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.640
And you'll see life in a different way,


00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.840
and you'll gain a lot.


00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.520
- Yeah, that's super interesting.


00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.760
I do agree with it,


00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.400
that you don't necessarily have to agree


00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.680
with everything they say.


00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.360
It doesn't have to match your situation,


00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.240
but it does give you a whole lot more experience


00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.240
without going through the hardship


00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.440
of getting that experience.


00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.240
- Exactly, and I think it's magic.


00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.120
That's what separates human beings from animals, right?


00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.080
Where we can transfer knowledge,


00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.960
we can perform telepathy.


00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.680
I can transfer knowledge to you,


00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.200
to anyone on the internet by writing.


00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.000
And people do that through books in the past.


00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.520
- Yeah, very interesting. - So that's magic.


00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.400
- So you say books are the weights and biases


00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.480
of the great thinkers who've come before us.


00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.160
That's pretty awesome.


00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.280
So on this, I wanted to ask you about


00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.400
what you thought about, I don't know,


00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.920
quote, new media, right?


00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.200
Like I'm thinking in particular YouTube,


00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.040
but other places, right?


00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.600
Like these books are very,


00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.000
like the tradition of meaningful books are very important


00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.560
and long and everybody knows about them, right?


00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.600
But you talked about the MOOCs before.


00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.760
I mean, YouTube,


00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.360
I was talking about the negative aspects of it before,


00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.440
but there, it's amazing what you can learn


00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.280
if you go over to places like YouTube


00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.040
with the desire to seek out this kind of information.


00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.560
Like there's so much good stuff there


00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.440
mixed in with like cat videos, right?


00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.480
- Yeah. - What do you think?


00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.200
- I think that, hmm,


00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.200
I am ambivalent to it.


00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.920
I think I have a preferred way of learning,


00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.160
which is to read books.


00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.440
Nonetheless, I know that video is awesome


00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.280
in the sense that I can write some code,


00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.160
I can iterate and you can see me doing it.


00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.640
It's almost impossible to convey that in a book,


00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.240
or maybe some code examples.


00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.320
So that's really amazing.


00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:09.760
I think both new media has strengths


00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.040
and it also has,


00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.240
and the difference between new media and traditional media


00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.320
is that new media is just a lot more powerful.


00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.840
A lot more powerful, it can be powerful for good


00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.520
and also powerful for not so good.


00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.720
A lot more powerful in the sense that,


00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.480
you know, MOOCs are amazing, right?


00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.200
A professor can teleport into your house and teach you.


00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.560
That's powerful,


00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.040
but powerful for not so good


00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.040
in the sense that we have things like,


00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.560
that reduce your attention span,


00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.880
like those videos or short snippets of articles.


00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.920
It's also very powerful.


00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.360
It's just whether it's for good or not so good.


00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.280
So that's something to think about


00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.880
when you're using new media to learn.


00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.360
- It is, yeah.


00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.560
It's definitely more risky


00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.560
in that you can get distracted and pulled away


00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.480
'cause all those places are about that for sure.


00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.320
But, you know, like I was recently watching a video


00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.080
of an opera singer and like vocal coach


00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.680
analyzing like this heavy metal singer


00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.120
and like dissecting the song


00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.960
from a perspective of like an opera singer.


00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.160
And I'm like, I appreciate both of those art forms way more


00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.200
having seen like that experience.


00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.560
And I would never have that experience.


00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.400
- Exactly.


00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.200
- And I would never go down to the bookstore


00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.280
and pick up a book on like, you know,


00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.360
singing theory and stuff.


00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.520
I just wouldn't, right?


00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.720
I would find something else that I'd spend my time on.


00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.800
But anyway, like those are the kinds of things


00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.680
I'm thinking that you just, you wouldn't expect,


00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.440
but you can find interesting things there, right?


00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.800
- Definitely, definitely.


00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.800
- Yeah, I wanna go back really to this one


00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.640
really super quick 'cause I skipped over it right at the end.


00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.640
But you talk about this exploring


00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.840
versus exploit, exploration versus exploitation thing


00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.600
and saying, look, you don't always have to worry


00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.560
so much about this stuff


00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.800
'cause sometimes many things are what you call two-way doors.


00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.400
And there's this interview over here of Jeff Bezos.


00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.280
And he has this distinction of some decisions


00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.960
being two-way doors and some of them being one-way doors.


00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.960
And you shouldn't put about the same concern, worry, energy


00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.280
and whatnot into both types of decisions.


00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.560
They're not equal, so don't treat them equal.


00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.520
Can you speak to that real quick?


00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.240
I thought that was super interesting.


00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.520
- Yeah, I think that I'm just gonna use Jeff's example.


00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.800
For example, maybe you're doing a side hustle


00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.840
and someone wants to acquire it


00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.440
or someone wants to complete purchase it from you.


00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.080
That's a one-way door that after you sold it,


00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.880
there's no way to reverse it, right?


00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:46.320
So however, you know that maybe you start a side hustle


00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.440
and then maybe you're thinking,


00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.840
"Hey, should I be targeting Python programmers


00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.000
or R programmers or, I don't know, Scala programmers?"


00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.560
That's a two-way door.


00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.840
You can easily pivot.


00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.160
So I think what Jeff is saying is that the one-way door,


00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:07.480
they're very difficult to reverse, but it's a lot less.


00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.400
It happens a lot less.


00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.480
And a lot of us, a lot of people


00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.080
treat two-way door decisions as one-way door decisions.


00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.280
And I think he's saying that,


00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.400
"Hey, you know, it's good to distinguish between both


00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.200
and devote the amount of energy and due diligence


00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.600
and analysis into each of this."


00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:29.000
And that makes it help you make


00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.360
more effective decisions more efficiently.


00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.000
- Yeah, I totally agree.


00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.200
I thought this was, like I said,


00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.680
I thought this was insightful.


00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.520
And I feel like in programming and in code,


00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.960
a lot of people get stuck


00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.280
in the so-called analysis paralysis.


00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.040
They're just stuck trying to decide.


00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.680
Like every decision is like, it's overwhelming


00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.200
and it's hard to decide what to do


00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.040
'cause you feel like you might make the wrong decision.


00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.080
You don't have enough experience.


00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.120
Like so much of those things,


00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.680
you can just, "Oh, we'll just refactor this later."


00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.000
Or we can just throw away this later.


00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.640
Like, "Oh, I'm gonna use a relational database.


00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.040
Oh, we should've used a NoSQL database."


00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.480
So we'll just throw it away and switch it over.


00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.560
It's like probably not that big of a deal versus-


00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.880
- Exactly.


00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.840
- We're gonna let all the Python guys go


00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.160
and hire a bunch of Java guys and rewrite the whole thing.


00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.840
Like if you're a year into that decision,


00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.360
you're fairly committed, right?


00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.760
Like, so there's really, I think understanding like,


00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.280
"Oh, that's a two-way door decision,"


00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.200
allows you to just like try it and experiment.


00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.040
- Fully agree.


00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.800
And that's what, that's hopefully by understanding


00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.440
the difference between one-way door and two-way doors,


00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.720
it makes it easier to explore.


00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.560
- Right.


00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.480
Yeah, I agree.


00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.440
I agree, I think that's worth calling out.


00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.600
All right, iterations.


00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.240
Find reps you can tolerate and iterate fast.


00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.560
So I think machine learning,


00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.240
a lot of machine learning involves iteration.


00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.360
Clearly neural networks are iterations.


00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.480
Every time you pass the data through multiple epochs


00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.840
and the data learns,


00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.480
with each iteration, with each epoch,


00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.920
the machine learning model error reduces.


00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.240
Your machine learning gets,


00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.960
model provides better predictions


00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.320
and gets more accurate with your metrics.


00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.800
That is the same with life.


00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.640
I think a lot of people expect,


00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.760
this is what I used to expect.


00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.240
I expected that I would read something once


00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.360
and I would fully understand it.


00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.200
All of the knowledge is in my brain.


00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.600
And then, I realized that that is never true.


00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.840
So, and actually,


00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.920
that actually lowers my expectation of myself.


00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.080
Sometimes I read a paper and I'll try to discuss it


00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.400
and I realize I don't actually know the details.


00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.080
That lowers expectation of myself.


00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.560
I tell myself, "Eugene, by reading it once,


00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.000
you're never going to get it.


00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.840
Don't fully expect yourself to that.


00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.520
It's too high a bar.


00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.840
So maybe read it a few times.


00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.560
Be kinder to yourself."


00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.400
So that's the same thing.


00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.480
When I read papers, I go through it multiple times.


00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.480
When I do A/B tests,


00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.760
I fail two times,


00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.200
so I might succeed.


00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.200
So I fail like 50 to 75% of the time.


00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.800
And you just got to learn to be kinder with yourself,


00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.040
when you iterate, right?


00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.720
I think I've posted some examples here.


00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.520
The Angry Birds developers failed 51 times.


00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:18.400
Sir James Dyson failed 5,000 times in 15 years


00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.760
before a vacuum cleaner worked, right?


00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.600
And imagine if he did, we would never have that.


00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.240
But again, a lot of great examples here


00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.040
about people who just iterated and just stuck to it.


00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.760
- I think also sort of ties into the previous one, right?


00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.240
The two-way doors.


00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.760
It's okay if it doesn't work


00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.920
on a lot of these types of things.


00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.520
Just keep going, just try again, right?


00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:43.400
Eventually you'll find one that fits, yeah?


00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.360
- Yeah, there's plenty of doors.


00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.000
- Yeah, speaking of fitting, overfitting.


00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.440
Focus on intuition and keep learning.


00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.720
- So I think overfitting is,


00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.320
well, I guess it's overfitting


00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.600
is when your machine learning model


00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.480
memorizes the training set too much


00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.680
and can't predict well on the prediction set.


00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.520
- Right, it's almost perfect on the training set.


00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.800
Like it knows that it's cold,


00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.320
but it's so specific that any slight variation,


00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.040
even though it should be a dog,


00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.680
it doesn't know it's a dog.


00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.200
- Exactly, and an example of this is


00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.320
when your machine learning model learns on customer IDs


00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.120
and when new customer IDs come in, it's just crap.


00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.120
So I think the clearest,


00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:29.560
the person who really pushes for this is Richard Feynman.


00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.640
He says that, and the way he teaches math and physics


00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.880
is the same.


00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.120
He goes directly into intuition,


00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.120
forget about formulas or forget about memorizing stuff.


00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.840
If you understand the intuition,


00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.280
you will understand it better


00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.440
and you can generalize across many, many things.


00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.080
I think in life, it also makes the same sense.


00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.760
Don't try to memorize things


00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.000
or don't try to memorize knowledge, right?


00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.960
I think if you have the intuition of the fundamentals,


00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.840
you'll find that it transfers across


00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.360
many, many, many, many, many different domains.


00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.760
For example, I think Elon Musk


00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.960
talks about knowledge as a tree.


00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.800
So the fundamentals of the tree are the trunk.


00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.880
That trunk is the fundamentals


00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.920
that supports all the branches.


00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.800
You wanna make sure that the intuition is like the trunk.


00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.760
You wanna make sure that your trunk is solid


00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.480
and then you can build on new branches


00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.360
or cut off new branches


00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.720
and grow new branches as necessary.


00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.680
So I think the way to grow this intuition,


00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.200
at least for me, I find that being a beginner


00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.320
is the best way to do this.


00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.280
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.320
Okay, very interesting.


00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:46.320
Last one has to do with ensembles and ensembling,


00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.800
diversity of strength.


00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.800
What is ensembling?


00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.520
- I guess ensembling is that I could train a model,


00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.600
maybe a linear regression


00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.440
and another model, maybe a decision tree


00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.640
and another model, maybe a k-nearest neighbors


00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.600
and they would all have their different errors.


00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.480
They would all have the different biases and strengths.


00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.360
But the unusual thing in machine learning


00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.280
is that you can just take all your predictions


00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.880
and average them and they would do better


00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.240
than all of them combined.


00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.440
And actually that's a cheat code


00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.760
that everyone is doing on Kaggle competition.


00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.360
You just train thousands of models


00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.800
and just combine all of them.


00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:27.800
- You know, it reminds me of like a much simpler example.


00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.920
There's sort of the wisdom of crowds.


00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.680
Like you hear stories of people saying,


00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:36.320
like, here's a jar, a big glass jar full of jelly beans.


00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.280
You got to guess how many jelly beans there are.


00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.640
Like many, any given person will over underestimate


00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.240
a whole lot, but if you ask a hundred people,


00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.200
it's usually really close to the actual number.


00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.040
Or, you know, there's some weird examples of this


00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.440
at like state fairs, there'll be like a cow


00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.720
and people will have to ask like,


00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.360
how much does the cow weigh?


00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.480
You know, it's like a competition


00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.320
and people get it really wrong,


00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.520
but it's usually really close if enough people answer


00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.280
and participate and it's average, right?


00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.560
- Exactly.


00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.760
So having diversity, diversity of opinions,


00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.640
diversity of thoughts, I think is very powerful.


00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.480
So that's what I'm trying to encourage here as well.


00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.320
- Yeah, so what's the story about life here?


00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.760
Instead of like guessing the weight of cows,


00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.800
which is not practical.


00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.720
- Well, I think that one way, okay, maybe a quick one,


00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.680
which is one way to do when you're trying to build teams


00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:30.680
is you might want to deliberately try to find people


00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.840
which are different from you, which are different,


00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.800
which compliment your strengths.


00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.680
I know, you know, sometimes in tech interviews,


00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.480
we want to find people that are similar to us,


00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.520
have the same skillsets that, you know, fit this mold,


00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.640
fit this job description.


00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.040
That's useful, it's effective.


00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.600
But I personally have built teams where it's very diverse,


00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.640
maybe from different countries or one third female.


00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.040
And I found that the creativity that comes from this


00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.440
is really powerful.


00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.080
And the other one, which is, I think, of course,


00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.400
Scott Adams is known for this.


00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.360
He says that, you know,


00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.120
if you can't be the top of your field,


00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:12.040
combine multiple superpowers like Scott Adams did.


00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.560
He combined his ability to draw, his sense of humor


00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.720
and his business know-how and he created Dilbert,


00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.600
which is no one else can replicate Dilbert.


00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.560
It needs someone like Scott Adams to do that.


00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.080
- Yeah, you know, that general idea,


00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.240
I actually hit on this a lot because


00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.280
there are a lot of people who listen to this show


00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.160
who are not traditional computer science developers


00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.440
or traditional data science folks.


00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.640
And I think sometimes they feel like it's,


00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:43.160
they don't have quite the same skillset


00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.360
to compete with those people.


00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.320
And how are they going to compete with somebody with a,


00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.120
you know, a master's degree from Stanford


00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.760
in computer science?


00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.800
You know, what I, my thought on all this is,


00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.560
you look, if you're really good at economics


00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.080
and you're pretty good at programming,


00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.360
there's not too many people


00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.360
who have both of those skills, right?


00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.880
Like all of a sudden you go from competing


00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.880
with a hundred thousand down to like 500 or something.


00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.640
I don't know, not that maybe it's a little bit extreme,


00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.960
but you know, like the,


00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.920
that if you need that intersection of skills,


00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.360
all of a sudden it becomes super, super powerful.


00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.920
And what you're suggesting here is maybe like building teams.


00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.240
You can kind of build that in the team


00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.840
rather than in an individual.


00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:20.680
- Exactly.


00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.480
And I want to go back to your previous example,


00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.560
you know, someone who's maybe a decent programmer,


00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.840
but you know, can't compete with someone who graduated


00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:32.040
with a degree in CS and a master's in CS and PhD in CS.


00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.080
It goes back to Navelle's tweet, right?


00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:37.480
There's something that is just right for you


00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.800
that can tap on your skills in economics and com science.


00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.400
You just need to find it and that'll be a great fit.


00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.680
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.480
All right.


00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.720
Well, that was the seven items.


00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.800
And I, you know, I enjoyed thinking about them


00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:57.360
and just seeing how these machine learning examples


00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.640
maybe can be analogies for living life.


00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.120
It's pretty cool.


00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.120
- Thank you.


00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.360
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:05.840
So a couple of other things real quick


00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.200
that you've spoken about is you've written a couple


00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:12.240
of things on sort of productivity as a developer


00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.840
and in the tech field, one article called


00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.080
how to accomplish more with less useful tools and routines.


00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.240
And then also routines and tools to optimize your day


00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:24.560
which is a guest post by Susan Chu.


00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.400
- Yep.


00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.680
- So, yeah, those were really interesting,


00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.040
but in particular during one of them,


00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.000
I don't remember which one,


00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.680
you talk about this article by Paul Graham


00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:41.040
and Paul Graham wrote this thing called


00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:44.560
maker's schedule versus manager's schedule.


00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.360
And, you know, I think you talk a lot


00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.880
or we talk in the tech field a lot about getting into flow,


00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.400
you know, really programming


00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.120
and just having uninterrupted time.


00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.520
And yet I think probably more than ever


00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.400
people are being pulled in different directions


00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.600
because everyone is just a Zoom call away.


00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.720
It's not, even if you're not in the office,


00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.640
you're now just as eligible to be sucked


00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.080
into a meeting as anyone else, right?


00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.080
- Yep, definitely.


00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.320
- Yes, can you talk real quickly about this?


00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.040
'Cause I think it's a short article,


00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.960
but I think having awareness of this idea


00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.640
of a maker's schedule and a manager's schedule


00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.760
and how they're not super compatible


00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.440
and you gotta be careful to help them coexist.


00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:31.160
- Yeah, so I think that, of course,


00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.240
all credit goes to Paul Graham for this.


00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:37.200
So makers, you know, to even start to design something


00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.000
or to start to code a framework,


00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.720
you sort of need, I don't know about you,


00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.360
but it takes me like 30 minutes to warm up,


00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.760
to load all the concepts into my memory


00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.880
so I can start juggling them in my head.


00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.080
I mean, once I load all that into my head


00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.200
and then I can, okay, I can start writing pseudocode,


00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.160
you know, tweaking things, testing things iteratively.


00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.320
And that takes time.


00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.200
And it takes me maybe about 45 minutes,


00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.160
60 minutes to get into flow.


00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.600
And once I'm in the flow, I'm moving really quickly,


00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.640
like speeding things through,


00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.120
or once I'm in the flow of fixing a bug


00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.720
and I don't know about you,


00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.840
but if I don't fix the bug, I can't stop.


00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.720
I can't go for lunch.


00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.080
And that motivation, that drive,


00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.400
if someone pulls me into a meeting,


00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.600
it sort of kills the motivation sometimes for the day.


00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.360
And, you know, if you had continued for just 30 minutes,


00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.520
you would have fixed it.


00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:27.400
But if it's broken by something in the middle,


00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.240
you'll be gone.


00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:31.800
So how I try to do this is that


00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:35.080
I actually deliberately block my time


00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.920
in the morning before lunch.


00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.080
I actually block it out with meetings,


00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:39.920
my own meetings,


00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.000
so that I can actually use that time to get into flow.


00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.160
It depends on when your energy level is highest.


00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.560
For me, it's actually in the morning.


00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.720
And then I actually have,


00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.800
I say that when people want to ask for a meeting,


00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.960
I say, "Oh, sure, let's do it after 3 p.m.


00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.440
"if you're okay with it."


00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:56.240
Because after 3 p.m., I mostly can't do deep work anyway.


00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.000
So I think that's useful to be aware of.


00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.720
- Yeah, it's really interesting.


00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.600
And I agree with that.


00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:06.000
Paul talks about, if you're on a manager's schedule,


00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.880
what you do is you go from meeting to meeting to meeting.


00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.000
And if you've got an hour gap in your day,


00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.480
you know, oh, you could just meet with somebody else.


00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.760
Maybe that's like a time to just set up a meeting


00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:15.760
so you could get to know somebody


00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.480
and dig in with that person or the team or the project.


00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:23.280
And that's fine if you're on a manager's schedule.


00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.600
But if you're on the maker's schedule,


00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.360
maybe you do need the whole morning uninterrupted


00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.520
so that you can get into that.


00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:32.000
You know, like, you know you've had a good session


00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
when you've been programming, programming,


00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.920
and then you stop for a second and you're like,


00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.480
"Wow, I'm hungry."


00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.160
I really have to go get something.


00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.480
It's like three in the afternoon,


00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.320
I forgot to eat lunch.


00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.320
Like that's totally possible that that happens, right?


00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.600
But if, yeah.


00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.440
- And I would just want to say


00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.480
that these sessions feel so fulfilling, feel so satisfying.


00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.800
You feel like you've gotten so much work done


00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.680
in such a compressed amount of time that, okay,


00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:00.040
and now you can, sure, I can have office hours now.


00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.880
So those sessions are really fulfilling.


00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.640
- Yeah, I don't know how this is gonna work out,


00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.160
but after reading this and some of your other writing,


00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.120
I decided on my calendar,


00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:13.000
I'm just blocking like Tuesday and Friday, like all day.


00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.440
And I'm just gonna call those maker days.


00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.320
We'll see how that works out.


00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.960
And I feel like I can just get a lot of stuff done.


00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.920
So other days I'll have more meetings.


00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.120
We'll see, I don't know.


00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:24.080
- I'm looking forward to hearing your experience.


00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:24.920
- Thanks, yeah.


00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.320
- Love to hear your experience about that.


00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.160
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.880
And Chris May, hey Chris, out in the live stream says,


00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.880
"Personal productivity brings superpowers


00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.040
"to the powers you got by learning Python."


00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.640
Totally agree.


00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.480
- Yep.


00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.320
- Yeah, awesome.


00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.200
Very cool.


00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.320
All right, well, I think that's probably


00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.160
about all the stuff that we have time to talk about.


00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.960
Although maybe really quickly,


00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.480
you could touch on, at the bottom of your homepage,


00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.240
you've got a bunch of resources.


00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.520
Maybe just highlight some you think


00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.400
that people would find valuable there.


00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.720
- So yeah, I like to, again,


00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.720
a lot of these are answering questions that people ask me.


00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.720
So people ask me, what are your favorite papers are?


00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.160
What paper should I read?


00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.600
So that's the second one on the list


00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:09.440
is Applied ML, where I try to collect papers


00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.200
on real-world machine learning,


00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.760
by companies that have implemented it,


00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:14.200
the lessons they learned.


00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.480
And sometimes people ask me,


00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.440
wow, I'm starting again to this field,


00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.640
there's so much to learn.


00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.640
And that's the third link there,


00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.400
where I find machine learning surveys,


00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.280
where people summarize what has happened in the past.


00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.040
And of course, people ask me things like,


00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.480
how do you set up your Python repo


00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.720
so that you have code reviews


00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.920
and all that automatically or linting?


00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:37.400
So I have things like the Python collab template


00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.400
or how to test machine learning models.


00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.160
And of course, recently I wrote about


00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.760
how to write machine learning design docs,


00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.280
design documents, and of course I have that as well.


00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:51.360
So I mean, yeah, some of these are Git repos,


00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.440
some of these are just articles.


00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.520
And of course, there's the email course,


00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.320
which is a lot of people ask me,


00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.840
what makes an effective data scientist?


00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.800
This is the question I asked a lot of my mentors


00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.280
five years ago, and I try to summarize


00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.960
the five lessons that I've learned


00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.800
in a short email course,


00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.440
where I only send you one lesson a day.


00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.360
And of course, there's a short exercise


00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.800
that I hope people will do.


00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.680
And that's why I send you one lesson a day.


00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.520
And that short exercise maybe takes an hour each.


00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:22.240
And I hope that after this, it sort of opens your mind


00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.360
that being an effective data scientist


00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.480
is beyond coding well,


00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.960
is beyond PhD level research, is beyond math.


00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.960
- Cool, yeah, that looks really useful.


00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:37.320
And you also have a paper mill dash ML flow.


00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.120
What do you think of paper mill?


00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:46.160
- So I started using this because I wanted to run


00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:49.640
rapid experimentations in Jupyter notebooks.


00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.000
And ML flow is something that helps you


00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.880
track your machine learning models.


00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.480
Paper mill allows you to parameterize,


00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.600
at least how I'm using it is I'm parameterizing


00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.320
my Jupyter notebooks.


00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.000
By combining both of them,


00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.600
I have a master Jupyter notebook


00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:03.880
that has all the different params


00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.160
and all the different countries and marketplaces.


00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.840
I can just run that huge Jupyter notebook


00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.920
and all the experiments are logged.


00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.120
So I love it.


00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.640
So I decided to make it a template


00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.320
that other people can use as well.


00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.720
- Cool, yeah, people can check out all those things.


00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:19.200
Put it in the show notes also on your website.


00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.360
- Yep.


00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.320
- All right.


00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.800
Well, I think that's probably it for all the time we have.


00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.440
So let me ask you the final two questions


00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.280
before you get out of here.


00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:28.080
You've written about two options.


00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.440
So I don't know which one you're gonna go with here,


00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.200
but you're gonna write some Python code


00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.840
outside of Jupyter, say like what text editor to use.


00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:38.280
- I have an answer and I'm curious about your answer as well.


00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.720
For me, I'm a diehard PyCharm fan.


00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.360
I've tried using VS Code.


00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:48.080
Just doesn't feel as snappy as IntelliSense,


00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:48.920
as you think.


00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.400
I've been using VS Code for my JavaScript,


00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.480
but what's your take, Michael?


00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:55.840
Should I be using VS Code more?


00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.840
- Look, I'm a fan of people doing VS Code


00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.160
and I know a lot of people love it.


00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.360
The style of PyCharm is exactly, it just fits my brain.


00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:06.880
Like I feel that it just so perfectly understands


00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.520
the project I'm working on,


00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.040
that it's the right tool for me as well.


00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.360
- That's me, that's me.


00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.520
And I do some Scala on the side


00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:17.680
and PyCharm has a Scala sister, which is IntelliJ.


00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.920
And that is just me, that I'm still a diehard PyCharm fan.


00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:23.200
- Yeah, right on.


00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:26.160
And then notable PyPI project or package


00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:29.280
that something out there, maybe not the most popular,


00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.120
but you're like, oh, I found this thing


00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.400
and it was super helpful.


00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.360
- Well, off the top of my head,


00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.440
I cannot think of anything, honestly.


00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:38.680
But one thing that I love,


00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:42.720
that I hope people will love is pytest.


00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.240
- Yeah, all right, yeah, pytest is super good.


00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:48.360
You know, let me throw out an example for you.


00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:51.920
I should be careful,


00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.680
but I put Python on that search term.


00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.040
So along with this pytest idea,


00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.080
something that I came across recently is Great Expectations,


01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.360
which is kind of like automated testing


01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.160
for the data cleaning and data validation,


01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.520
both when you're pulling it in the first time


01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.480
as well as like production.


01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.600
So there's a one to build on top of the pytest story.


01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.760
- Exactly, so as of now, the things that are on my mind,


01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.600
pytest, PyLint, myPy,


01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.880
the things that make code manageable and maintainable,


01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.400
I think about that a lot.


01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.320
- Yeah, fantastic.


01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:31.520
All right, well, that's it for all the stuff


01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.520
we've got covered.


01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.800
Eugene, thank you for being on the show.


01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.640
Final call to action,


01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.040
people are, maybe they wanna get into your writing


01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.360
or they wanna start writing and thinking more,


01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.680
sort of almost become a developer philosopher type.


01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.240
So what advice you got for 'em?


01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.160
- Just stop writing.


01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.440
Final advice, why write?


01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.720
Okay, by writing, you put your stuff online


01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:52.560
and people find you.


01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.520
And this is why this podcast even happened, right?


01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.800
Michael found me through my writing


01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.440
and we talk about, and we find like-minded people.


01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.920
That has happened to me.


01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.720
I find so many like-minded people talking to me


01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.520
about machine learning and systems and writing


01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.400
and I've made so many new friends.


01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.280
Do that and you'll make a lot of new friends online.


01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.680
Highly recommend it.


01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.600
- Yeah, it's great advice.


01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.400
I find like stepping just even a tiny bit


01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.320
outside of your comfort zone starts to lead to other things.


01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.400
And maybe you're not doing writing,


01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.000
maybe you're speaking at a meetup.


01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.520
That's even more possible than it used to be


01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.520
'cause you don't have to travel anymore, right?


01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.800
You can reach out to meetups that are not next to you


01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.640
and so on.


01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.520
All those things make huge differences.


01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.840
- Definitely, highly recommend.


01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.800
And if you write because of this podcast, email me.


01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:39.840
My email's on my website.


01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.440
I would love to read what you wrote about.


01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.280
- Fantastic.


01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.560
All right, Eugene, thank you for being on the show.


01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.640
It's been really great to chat with you


01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.880
about all this stuff.


01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.400
- Welcome, it's my pleasure.


01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.600
Take care. - Yeah.


01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.440
Yeah, take care.


01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.120
- Chris, thanks for dropping by.


01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.840
I'm glad you are enjoying the show.


01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.160
And I know you cut at the end, but we'll enjoy it.


01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.960
And thanks everyone for coming on the live stream.


01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.760
And yeah, we'll catch you next time.


01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.140
Catch you next time!
