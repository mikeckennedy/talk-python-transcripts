WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
I want to welcome everybody to the something,


00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.600
something hundredth episode of Talk Python To Me.


00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.080
I am your host, Jay Miller.


00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.840
Our normal host, Michael Kennedy,


00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.000
apparently had some flight issues. Oh no, he's here.


00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.440
>> I'm here. Hello, everyone.


00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.080
>> We talked about this and I said,


00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.160
"I have an idea, trust me."


00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.760
And you said, "Okay."


00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.320
>> I trust you, Jay. This will be fine.


00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.600
>> I think a lot of people have made that mistake in the past.


00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.280
but I'm going to be interviewing you.


00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.200
And for those that don't know, I'm Jay Miller.


00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.200
I am a now six-time guest on the show.


00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.320
I think you get a jacket for that.


00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.160
- You're in the 1%.


00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.980
You're a 1%.


00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.820
- I am in the 1%.


00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.640
- The top 1% of guests.


00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.160
- The only person who's been on the show more times


00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.720
than me is my boss, which is annoying,


00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.680
'cause he will rub it in after he hears this.


00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.520
But yeah, Mike, we've been kind of working together


00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.600
for what, four years now?


00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.480
>> Four or five years.


00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.680
>> Four or five years. For those that don't know,


00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.400
I do a little bit of marketing behind the scenes.


00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.200
So, if you get that newsletter,


00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.040
if you're not subscribed to


00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.320
the Talk Python newsletter, you need to be.


00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.120
I work really hard on that.


00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.280
By the way, it may not come out


00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.160
this weekend because I'm here.


00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.960
Just so you know.


00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.920
But yes, so we've known each other for four or five years.


00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.440
I think I was on like episode 15 or something like that.


00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.000
>> Yeah, quite early. About developer productivity.


00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.400
>> Yeah.


00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.040
>> It's wonderful.


00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.480
>> So, I wanted to take this time to ask you


00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.840
questions similar to what you would do.


00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.720
Let's start with one of the easiest ones of why a podcast?


00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.640
>> Why a podcast? Well, I had done a lot of different things


00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.640
trying to teach people coding and evangelize coding,


00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.000
and that involved things like going to user group talks,


00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.740
or doing trainings and all these were like,


00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.720
"Hey, it's awesome.


00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.680
20 people showed up and are really engaged,


00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.400
but what if you leverage the Internet to reach more people?"


00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.480
>> Yeah.


00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.400
>> That was really one of the motivations,


00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.120
is just how can you have a bigger impact.


00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.560
When I got started with Talk Python,


00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.160
there were zero Python podcasts.


00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.440
I'm like, "Why are there zero Python podcasts?"


00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.760
There had been some before,


00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.880
but they'd all shut down.


00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.520
I'm like, "That doesn't make any sense.


00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.400
such a vibrant community and no one


00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.960
to interview and share the stories of it.


00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.800
So, here we are, seven, eight years later.


00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.420
>> Yeah. I mean, you've really trailblazed that industry.


00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.840
I think since your show,


00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.360
we've had Tobias started podcasting it.


00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.240
Dan has a Real Python podcast.


00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.960
I think Chris is running. Hey, is that Chris right there?


00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.920
>> Yeah, that is Chris.


00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.160
He's giving a shout out right here.


00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.480
>> Speaking of the Real Python podcast right there,


00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.360
>> I think Sean's here from Teaching Python.


00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.360
>> Sean and Tibor is here.


00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.960
>> We've even seen it expand into


00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.280
kind of smaller niches like Django,


00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.200
and we have like the Django chats.


00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.880
>> Yeah, Django chats.


00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.040
>> Some of those shows and I mean,


00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.200
a little show Python Community News on YouTube.


00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.480
Go check that out. But it's great


00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.760
that you started this thing


00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.120
because there wasn't a thing there,


00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.320
and then afterwards, a ton of shows showed up.


00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.000
And I see some other podcasters in the audience.


00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.640
I think I see like a Python bytes and tests and code.


00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.760
Brian Okken here as well.


00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.960
How does it feel to see that now that you kick-started things,


00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.320
the ecosystem is thriving?


00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.000
>> I think it's fantastic. Like I said,


00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.680
the goal was to share


00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.240
the stories of this community that weren't being told.


00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.240
And now I think so many people have taken up that torch.


00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.200
It's great. And I think there's room for all of us.


00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.960
we all have kind of our own special flavor


00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.000
and people can gravitate to what they like.


00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.440
- Yeah, yeah.


00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.280
And you've interviewed a few hundred people.


00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.600
- I think we're over 450 different guests


00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.720
so far in the show.


00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.880
- Did you think there was that much to talk about


00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.960
in the Python space?


00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.960
- No, I had a plan, Jay, I had a plan.


00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.040
And it involved five episodes.


00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.880
- Okay. - I'm like, okay,


00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.880
the first five, the first one was me announcing the show.


00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.760
So four, I'm like, okay, I know four people


00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.440
who I can interview about this.


00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.160
Talked about SQLAlchemy, talked about Pyramid,


00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.480
the web framework, and a couple of other things.


00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.680
And I'm like, all right, now what?


00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.360
But thankfully, so many people were really excited


00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.080
that, hey, there finally is a Python podcast.


00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.900
That was a great show.


00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.320
You should talk to so-and-so.


00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.960
And this, have you considered this?


00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.280
And now it's just a snowball going downhill.


00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.920
It's great.


00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.520
But I had no idea it would make it this far, no.


00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.560
- That's awesome.


00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.240
So I know that just between you and I working together,


00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.440
we have developed things for the show


00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.280
to make the show easier to manage and maintain.


00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.440
Has there been any projects that you've


00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.640
developed that have come out of inspiration from the show?


00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.120
Oh, yeah.


00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.680
There's tons of software behind the scenes


00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.600
that are all about automation and different kinds of things,


00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.240
both for the podcast itself and the courses.


00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.700
It's amazing just how much these little tiny scripts or


00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.500
little things you can write in an afternoon that


00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.740
will just completely change your workday.


00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.460
You're like, "You know what? This used to be such a pain and


00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.180
now it's completely automatic or it's almost automatic."


00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.140
Really great transcripts, some of the new AI stuff,


00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.560
used to ship the files all over to different servers.


00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.020
Now, I've got to set up differently.


00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.180
But just a ton of software that's constantly written.


00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.020
It's never ending fun and it's also a really cool playground.


00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.340
>> Yeah.


00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.460
>> Like I really want to learn


00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.140
FastAPI or I want to learn this thing.


00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.060
Let me just use that for


00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.540
this little small project I got and


00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.780
now I have some experience with it. It's great.


00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.300
>> I have definitely gotten to witness like,


00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.460
"Oh, hey, just add this thing and


00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.540
now it'll run and do all this stuff."


00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.060
Then usually I come in and I go,


00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.340
"Hey, I built something too."


00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.540
You're like, "I can't get it to work."


00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.660
I go, "Oh, yeah. I broke it. I'm sorry.


00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.540
Your entire show is down."


00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.380
>> That's fine.


00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.220
I don't think I've done that yet.


00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.700
I haven't, I haven't, I've brought an entire networks down.


00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.620
I don't think I've brought in the podcast down yet.


00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.620
- I think the thing that took the site down


00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.140
for the longest was the Walrus operator.


00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.980
- The Walrus operator.


00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.900
- The Walrus operator.


00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.140
- Shout out to the Walrus operator.


00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.780
That's my favorite part of Python.


00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.300
- Thank you, Emily.


00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.900
No, the Walrus operator is awesome,


00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.300
but when the servers were running 3.7


00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.900
and I was running 3.8 on my dev machine,


00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.220
I have these little management scripts


00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.020
for all this kind of stuff we're talking about, right?


00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.860
- Yeah.


00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.060
- And I'm like, well, that part's not part


00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.300
the website, I'll do that, I'll write


00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.500
Walrus operator code and all sorts of stuff.


00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.220
When I shipped it, the framework tried to


00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.160
scan to see if there was any routes in there,


00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.100
and it couldn't parse it and it just couldn't start.


00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.900
I'm like, "Why won't there be?


00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.580
I haven't even touched it. What's going on?"


00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.660
I'm like, "Oh, the Walrus operator took it down."


00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.500
>> That's funny. So you've interviewed a ton of people,


00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.260
and I'm not going to ask you


00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.260
to say who's your favorite person to interview,


00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.780
because we know the answer is me.


00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.900
>> Yes.


00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.300
I want to, what were some of


00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.420
the most surprising interviews that you had?


00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.980
>> There's a whole set of categories,


00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.580
different categories of surprising, right?


00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.300
And your shows were very interesting


00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.020
and I really enjoyed talking to you about them.


00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.300
They're really inspiring because they're not just,


00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.900
here's this API, but they were higher level, right?


00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.660
Like developer productivity and stuff.


00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.540
However, I would say the stuff that surprises me the most is,


00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.500
where people are doing things you


00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.360
wouldn't have expected with Python.


00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.480
Like, "Oh, hey, we're actually using machine learning in


00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:51.000
Python to find exoplanets in old stale Kepler data."


00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.440
>> Yeah.


00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.320
>> And so, there's this group in Oxford who found


00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.960
50 exoplanets running machine learning


00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.440
across data they thought was already analyzed and done.


00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.280
And you would learn weird things like they said,


00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.200
"We used to have grad students do it,


00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.040
And that was OK, but it was really variable,


00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.640
like the mood of the grad student mattered.


00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.040
For example, at Oxford, they always


00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.080
had cookies and coffee at 3.


00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.640
So more exoplanets were found after 3 than before 3.


00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.840
There's no difference in the data, but you know.


00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.000
And they're like, if we could bring some automation,


00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.280
that might make science a little more scientific.


00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.000
Developer productivity tip-- add cookies and coffee


00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.680
to your daily routine, right?


00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.000
Yeah, for sure, for sure.


00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.720
So I'm thinking about a particular episode


00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.040
that I was on where you had Rivers Cuomo from Weezer.


00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.520
- That was one of the more known words, yes.


00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.260
- That was, I just, I remember getting the message


00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.280
from you of like, hey, you're gonna be on the show


00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.520
this week, and I was like, I can't, I've gotta,


00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.640
he's like, no, no, no, no, no, you are going


00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.960
to be on the show this week.


00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.080
- You'll want to be here, trust me, yes.


00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.960
- And then just being like, having to pick my jaw


00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.540
off the floor because like, you know,


00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.480
you had a rock star on the show.


00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.460
And I think that that is one of the beauties of podcasting


00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.880
is that just like Python is kind of stretched outside


00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.600
of developer community and is kind of branched


00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.320
into data science and branched into automation


00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.660
and hopefully we'll see Python in more and more spaces,


00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.660
like we're seeing it in places that no one would expect,


00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.880
like on stage, like with Rivers Cuomo.


00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.720
What was that like?


00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.760
How did that happen?


00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.880
So Rivers has an assistant who coordinates a bunch of stuff


00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.840
and send me a message and said,


00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.400
the assistant sent me a message.


00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.480
Rivers would like to be on the show.


00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.240
I'm like, "That is amazing."


00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.920
But you do understand it's a Python show and I


00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.360
hadn't realized how much coding he had done.


00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.760
So I actually got to go out and spend some time with


00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.080
him when he was in Portland at a concert.


00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.680
>> Rub it in. Rub it in. I like it.


00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.880
>> We hung out a little bit. He's like, "Let me


00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.080
show you all the code I'm writing."


00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.320
And we just had a great time geeking out before the show.


00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.920
And after I saw him like,


00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.000
"You have to be on the show.


00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.600
What you're doing is so awesome.


00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.200
So yeah, he's doing legitimately cool stuff.


00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.480
>> I think now he's actually contributing


00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.600
to open source in Python as well.


00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.880
>> Yeah, I saw him and Brett Cannon


00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.200
going back forth on some work.


00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.560
>> Let's not talk about Brett Cannon.


00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.640
He's not here right now. He'll be back tomorrow.


00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.080
You can ask him questions about that at the Ask Me Anything.


00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.880
>> Anyway, it was really awesome to have him on the show.


00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.720
It was cool to have you there as well.


00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.840
That was a real popular one.


00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.280
That was in the vein of what you opened this conversation with.


00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.840
It was a bunch of little automation tools that don't count as


00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.060
like, "Hey, I built Instagram," but they're like,


00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.280
"This is a really amazing thing I built,


00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.840
even if it only took a day,


00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.000
it was super powerful."


00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.520
>> Yeah. All right.


00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.960
So, we're about halfway through the interview.


00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.040
We understand that people want to get to talk.


00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.440
So, what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead


00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.720
and raffle off a pair of Surface earbuds.


00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.560
Also, if you want to catch the talks,


00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.760
feel free to go do that.


00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.360
This will be on the podcast.


00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.880
Where can people find the podcast while


00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.880
you're looking for a number here?


00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.160
I don't want to be biased.


00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.000
- You want to influence me?


00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.840
I'm not even looking.


00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.660
- Yeah, how do you?


00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.360
- Talkpython.fm or you go to your,


00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.280
any podcast player and just search for Talk Python.


00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.120
- Okay, okay.


00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.280
- How do I read the number?


00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.800
- Yeah, just read the number, read the number.


00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.480
- All right, I wasn't paid that much for this, so.


00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.000
The last four numbers are five, four, eight.


00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.640
- Oh wait, five, four, eight.


00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.440
- Five, four, eight, congratulations.


00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.280
- Aw.


00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.240
- Thank you, love the numbers.


00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.320
- Congratulations.


00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:25.620
So, going back to that, kind of that idea of like,


00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.760
hey, these are little tools and now they're being


00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.340
used with super amazing people in the Python space.


00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.640
Have you heard of anybody getting


00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.960
into Python because of your show?


00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.840
>> I've heard of a lot of people getting into there.


00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.780
You know, when I started the show,


00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.980
going back to the beginning a little bit,


00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.340
when I started the show, I expected,


00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.460
well, I tried to think, well,


00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.400
who will listen to a show about


00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.340
the people making these frameworks in these libraries?


00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.980
It's got to be the most hardcore developers,


00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.660
the people who maybe wrote that library or really,


00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.980
really into it, right?


00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:59.820
>> Yeah.


00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.980
>> Sure, people like that listening, it's great.


00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.940
But there's a bunch of people who listen and they'll say things like,


00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.580
"I'm starting to understand what you all are talking about after six weeks."


00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.060
I'm like, "Why have you listened to six weeks and not know what I'm talking about?


00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.740
It's really a kind of an honor,


00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.380
but why would you do that?"


00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.580
What they do is they're using it as language immersion.


00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.440
If I just immerse myself in this community,


00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.980
soon enough I will be a Python person.


00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.100
If I move to Brazil,


00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.580
maybe I could learn Portuguese if I just force myself to it.


00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.380
And there's a lot of people like that.


00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.620
So, there are a lot of people on that journey.


00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.820
>> And then I guess in the same vein,


00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.020
has any of the feedback from the show that you've done,


00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.620
kind of gone into some of the other things that you


00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.100
do like Talk Python Training?


00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.820
>> Constantly. I'll talk about something like this,


00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.440
might be interesting in everybody's. This is so amazing, so interesting. I want to


00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.460
learn more. I'm like, okay, well, maybe I should put some more effort into it.


00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.480
Either have more shows or do a course or something like that. Yeah, absolutely.


00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:08.080
Very cool. So I guess I got one more question and then I'm gonna go, I'm gonna


00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:14.400
do the thing that you do at the end. All right. So you have, the show itself


00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.080
has kind of migrated. It started as a podcast only and then I saw you start


00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.880
doing some videos, and then of course,


00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.400
the courses were always kind of a big part of this.


00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.240
And now you've kind of integrated


00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.280
that live stream component to it as well.


00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.000
How was making that change from it being pre-recorded,


00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.240
pre-talked, just you and the person you're interviewing,


00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.200
to now you have all of those things,


00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.120
but also a live audience listening over the internet?


00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.020
- Yeah, so smash the bell on YouTube, right?


00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.960
- Yeah, yeah.


00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.520
Like and subscribe, ring the bell, all that stuff.


00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.240
- Yeah, so seriously though, it was a big decision


00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.160
to make it a live show.


00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.160
And there were two things I was worried about.


00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.220
One is, will the guests who used to just sort of


00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.280
call up one-on-one and say, let's have a conversation,


00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.240
and then you'll edit it right?


00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.440
Because if I say something, I'm really new to this,


00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.280
and if you edit it, I think I can build up


00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.080
the confidence to be on there, like, oh guess what?


00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.960
We're live streaming it to the world,


00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.600
and it'll be written in ink on YouTube.


00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.840
That's a different sort of deal.


00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.920
And for the most part, people haven't minded.


00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.160
At first, they're like, "I'm a little nervous."


00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.880
I'm like, "It's fine, really, you'll be fine.


00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.720
"It has been fine every time."


00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.680
- It's always like the first time you go on a live stream,


00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.900
you're like, "I don't know what to do.


00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.980
"Do I stare at the camera?


00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.360
"Do I look at the screen?"


00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.280
But then after that, they're like,


00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.540
"Oh, that was so fun engaging with the audience live


00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.640
"and seeing the comments and doing all that stuff."


00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.480
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.500
From a logistics perspective,


00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.160
it's taken the effort down a little bit.


00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.080
Ironically, doing more, you'd think the livestream


00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.440
would add something, but we have people join the livestream


00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.820
and ask questions, so we can kind of make the audience


00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.320
part of the show, and like, oh, I should've asked


00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.540
that question, but so-and-so in the live chat did.


00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.600
That helps, and then also, if it's already live,


00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.720
you don't have to edit it as much, 'cause it's kind of,


00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.880
you're a little more on focus, because you're like,


00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.240
instead of like, hey, can we do that again,


00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.600
or can we talk, or can we pause it,


00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.720
like, you know we're livestreaming, we're just gonna go,


00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.200
And it works out, but it kind of takes away some of the going


00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.200
back and fixing it up.


00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.280
But it's been really cool.


00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.280
I got into it--


00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.120
I think the real motivation to get into it


00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:25.600
was through a common friend of ours, Cecil Philip.


00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.120
And I interviewed him and Brian Clark


00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.360
about their live streaming, their developer stuff.


00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.560
And I was like, that's pretty cool what they're doing.


00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.480
How are you doing it?


00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.320
The stuff over at Stripe that they're doing?


00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.400
No, no, when he was at Microsoft.


00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.600
Oh, OK.


00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.360
some of the like ask the expert stuff that we do.


00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:43.720
>> Yeah.


00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.120
>> Well, now we're doing it on the Microsoft YouTube channel.


00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.600
I was like the YouTube at Microsoft developer.


00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.360
>> Right on.


00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.000
>> Cool.


00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.400
>> Yeah. So anyway, he got me inspired watching what they were


00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.800
doing and got me using things like StreamYard.


00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.940
Yeah, it's real good.


00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.400
>> Very awesome. I love it. All right.


00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.440
So normally you have some rapid fire questions at the end.


00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.500
So I have some rapid fire questions for you.


00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.540
We're at PyCon 2023.


00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.560
What was your first PyCon US?


00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.960
My first PyCon US I think was in Portland,


00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.520
my hometown in 2015.


00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.760
>> In 2015.


00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.520
>> 2015, 2016.


00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.480
The irony was for that one year I was living in Germany,


00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.000
so I had to fly back,


00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.360
rent a hotel, stay a mile from my house,


00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.600
who someone else lived in it at


00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.120
the time because I was renting it,


00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.440
and then go to PyCon.


00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.280
So it was like a huge trip even though it was


00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.040
only two miles, three miles from my house.


00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.120
But it was a great time.


00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.680
>> What is the one conference talk


00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.080
that you always go back and listen to or watch?


00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.420
- Oh, the one conference talk, oh boy.


00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:47.600
I would say,


00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.600
The Birth and Death of JavaScript by Gary Bernhardt,


00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.120
which is, have you seen this?


00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.960
- I think I've seen it once.


00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.000
- It's, whenever I gotta do reference stuff


00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.720
with like low level JavaScript and stuff,


00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.740
I mean I know it's, this is Python and all,


00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.140
But I think he gave that at a Python conference


00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.980
as a comedy thing.


00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.060
But it's also a really interesting history


00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.100
of JavaScript as both drama.


00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:14.820
I don't know.


00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.780
If you haven't seen it, it's worth checking out.


00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.480
All right, two more rapid fire questions.


00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.700
What is your favorite addition or update to Python


00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.780
since you've been using it?


00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.460
I thought I was going to--


00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.060
I almost started like, oh, that's easy.


00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.420
But then there's two things that are really, really--


00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.460
OK, you can do two.


00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.380
I'm going to do two.


00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.460
I'm going to take two.


00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.020
Async and await, type hints.


00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.180
OK, shout out to type hints.


00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:39.860
Type hints is--


00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.360
Shout out, yeah.


00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.260
f-strings are probably up there for me.


00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.220
f-strings are like in the top five.


00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.060
Type hints are definitely up there.


00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.980
Walrus operator, you got a special place in my heart.


00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:49.660
You can take a site down.


00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.620
You can take a whole website down in a matter of seconds


00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:51.980
with that thing.


00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.420
No, the walrus operator is great.


00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.100
And then the last question is one that you normally ask.


00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.580
What is your favorite Python module or package?


00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.060
>> Yeah. There's a bunch of


00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.340
interesting ones I run across with Python bytes.


00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.420
Like Brian Okken, we find a bunch there.


00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:16.300
One that is really cool to me is Unsync.


00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.760
It just unifies threading,


00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.340
multiprocessing, and async and await in a nice cool way.


00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.620
I haven't been able to use it as much as I'd like,


00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.380
but I really like that one.


00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.260
I just want to give a shout out to Latexify.


00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.100
>> Okay.


00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.000
>> You sure it's not latechify?


00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:32.360
>> Yeah.


00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.320
>> You don't want the latech people,


00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.440
or sorry, latech people coming after us.


00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.880
>> Let me rephrase it. I meant latechify.


00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.360
You can put a decorator onto a function.


00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:42.880
>> Okay.


00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.920
>> A Python function that does math inside,


00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.320
and will write the symbolic


00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.080
mathematical representation of the Python code you wrote.


00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.040
>> Oh, that's really cool.


00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.040
>> It's insane.


00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:52.720
>> That's really cool.


00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.480
>> You can't do everything, but it'll be like, okay,


00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.200
well, that's an infinite sum from zero to infinity of this.


00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.520
How does it know? It's insane.


00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.360
>> Anyway.


00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.060
>> That's awesome. Well, Mike, again, thank you so much.


00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.040
Again, we've known each other for half a decade now.


00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.920
I hope we make it to a decade and more of


00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.240
working together and doing Talk Python stuff.


00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.240
Again, give people one more opportunity to


00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.240
know where they can learn more about the show.


00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.920
>> Yeah. If you're not subscribed,


00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.880
check it out at talkpython.fm or look for


00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.080
Talk Python in your podcast players.


00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.460
Really, really appreciate everyone.


00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.520
I mean, since I'm on this side of the microphone,


00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.800
Right, I genuinely want to say thank you to everyone here,


00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.240
but everyone who listens to the show.


00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.200
It's been such an honor,


00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.840
and it's so cool to be able to do that.


00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.320
You know, that's my full-time job now,


00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.520
is running the podcast.


00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.400
- That's awesome.


00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.800
- And I just, when I started,


00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.120
I thought, oh, this would be a cool hobby on the side.


00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.320
Like I said, five episodes,


00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.120
and I got to figure it out from there.


00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.440
It's just been such a great response from everyone,


00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.640
and thankful every day.


00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.920
And thank you for working.


00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.800
I also, 10 years.


00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.680
Let's do it, it'll be easy.


00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.960
>> Yeah. We'll make it happen.


00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.280
Thank you for letting us host


00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.600
this event at the Microsoft booth.


00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.120
I think we actually have a gift for you as well.


00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.480
Aaron, do you have one of the-


00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.640
>> What?


00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.040
>> We have an extra pair of Surface earbuds.


00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.880
>> Oh, that's awesome.


00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.560
>> Especially for you.


00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.720
As a thank you one for doing this,


00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.080
but also a thank you for all that you


00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.240
do within the Python community.


00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.640
Everyone, this has been Michael Kennedy.


00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.600
I've been Jay Miller. This has been Talk Python Live.


00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.080
Let's give Michael a hand, wonderful hand,


00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.480
for all that he's done for the past several years.


00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.440
(audience applauding)


00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.600
- Thank you, everyone.


00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.500
Hey, Mario.


00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.760
- Hey, Mike.


00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.520
- Great to see you here at the conference.


00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.680
- I'm happy to meet you.


00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.160
- Yeah, same here.


00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.480
First of all, before we get into it,


00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.320
just tell people quickly who are you.


00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.360
Introduce yourself.


00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.280
- My name's Mario.


00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.200
I live in Southern California,


00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.480
and I write a blog called Python by Night,


00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.600
which, you know, it's my hobby thing I do


00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.600
when the kids asleep, when my wife is asleep.


00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.780
That's what I do.


00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.400
- Yeah, some people play games.


00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.720
We write code or write blogs or whatever, awesome.


00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.440
So how's the commerce going for you?


00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.960
- Oh man, I'm having a great time.


00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.800
- Are you?


00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.440
- It's my second PyCon.


00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.320
And this morning I gave a lightning talk


00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.320
about being either a fly on the wall or a busy worker bee.


00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.160
And I've been a busy worker bee.


00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.280
- Yeah, you said the first time you came here,


00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.400
were speaking at lunch. You said the first time you came here, you kind of just held back and


00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.520
you're kind of just observing and watching from the outside and you kind of dove in with your


00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:36.320
feet first. You know, I tend to, I tend to be in the background most of the time, but yeah,


00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:42.720
I saw a tweet, I think asking for help over at the Python software foundation booth last year.


00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.920
And it includes beanbags by the way. It includes beanbags. Anyway, I went and helped out last year,


00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.400
met a lot of cool people. Then I just thought I should volunteer more. I got to meet a whole


00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:58.080
bunch of people I had only heard of or seen online, like some to me, Python heroes. And I


00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:03.760
thought this was excellent. So this year I just dove in and tripled that or quadrupled that, I


00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.920
guess. Yeah. Awesome. It seems like you're having a great time. I'm having a great time. Awesome.


00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.720
What is your plan Ben? Some people try to go all the talks and people hallway track it. Some


00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.800
Some people just go to the parties.


00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.320
What's your, what's your plan?


00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.080
let's see.


00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.960
So I guess I was so intent on getting my tutorial, which was on Wednesday, the


00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.000
very first tutorial that I hadn't even made a plan.


00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.960
I just was so focused on that.


00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.680
Once I gave the tutorial, I was breathing easy, but I had already


00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.880
volunteered to help with the online platform.


00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.280
I was helping with the booth again.


00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.760
So that kind of kept me busy.


00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.520
I had planned to attend a couple of talks.


00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.560
I've only been to two maybe.


00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.120
Yeah.


00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:41.320
Yeah.


00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:41.720
Yeah.


00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.280
So the plan was to survive the tutorial and then figure it out for them.


00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.240
And then figure it out.


00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:47.720
How'd it go?


00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.700
It was HTMX, right?


00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.680
One of the fine technologies integrated with Python.


00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.360
Fantastic.


00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.400
I feel like I've been talking about it all conference.


00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.640
I've talked to people individually.


00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.340
I had an open space about it.


00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.880
I talked about it at lunch.


00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:05.760
So it's, there's a real kind of a very palpable energy that people feel


00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.040
when they see what it can do.


00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:07.880
It's pretty exciting.


00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.800
A bunch of people have been putting off learning JavaScript because


00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.000
they felt they have to, and you're like, wait.


00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
You don't actually have to do that.


00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
- You don't have to. - You don't have to.


00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.720
- You really, keep it by the--


00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.640
- I haven't learned JavaScript, so.


00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.480
- Yeah, exactly.


00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.800
Not knocking on people who have and they're welcome to,


00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.680
but if you don't want to, you shouldn't be made to.


00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.040
- Yeah, it's not an either/or, it's both/and,


00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.320
but if you don't have to, you don't have to.


00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.000
- Yeah, the irony is, even Node.js JavaScript,


00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
people like it, because they don't have to write front-end


00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.680
JavaScript, they can write back-end JavaScript.


00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.520
- Right, yeah.


00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.760
- There's something in it for everyone.


00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.000
- Yeah, so that's been mostly it.


00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.760
I love the hallway track, I love meeting people,


00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:46.000
I, I got a picture with Ned who, you know, he gave it awesome opening keynote.


00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.460
You know, all sorts of people that I'm meeting for the first time.


00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.680
Other people I met last year.


00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.480
It's fantastic.


00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:52.840
Yeah.


00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.280
Awesome.


00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.560
What's your big takeaways?


00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.360
What has stood out for you?


00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.680
I mean, there's a bunch of cool stuff back here behind us at the expo hall and.


00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.720
Other things you probably saw talks like what, what stood out.


00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.240
What stood out.


00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:10.080
I think, you know, part of it is just coming, coming away from it.


00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.440
from these past couple years have been tough.


00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.400
Just not seeing a lot of people.


00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.920
And it is still kind of weird to see a lot of people.


00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.160
You feel that kind of hesitancy.


00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.560
People are still kind of feeling it out.


00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.640
But in spite of it all,


00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.200
I just think the Python community


00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.220
embraces people of all walks of life,


00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.120
no matter where you're coming from.


00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.500
Even flies like myself who tend to be,


00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.360
you know, trying to masquerade as a bee.


00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.520
Even so, I feel like it's a safe space to be vulnerable,


00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.560
to learn a lot, and to teach a lot.


00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.760
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.720
It's a very welcoming space, and we're stronger together.


00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.720
That means we ought to take time to be together, right?


00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.680
- Yeah, correct.


00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.680
- Right on.


00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.000
Well, thanks for taking the time to share your experience.


00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.840
Great to see you.


00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.160
- All right, awesome, thank you.


00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.000
- Yeah, thanks.


00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.820
Hey, Nick, how you doing?


00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.960
- Hey, hey, Michael.


00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.040
- Hey, it's good to see you.


00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.880
- Good to see you too.


00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.560
- Yeah, in person this time.


00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.400
- Yes, in person.


00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.040
- 'Cause last time it was on Python Bytes, right?


00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.640
- Yes, last time it was on Python Bytes.


00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.880
- Yeah, but here on PyCon.


00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.520
- Yes, PyCon 2023.


00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.040
- Yeah, so I just wanted to get together


00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.440
with a couple of folks, including you,


00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.560
and just ask, what's your PyCon experience this year?


00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.440
How's it going?


00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.840
- It has been actually quite amazing.


00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:27.000
This year was the first time I gave a talk at PyCon.


00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.280
My first ever talk.


00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.200
- How'd it go?


00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.120
- It went really well.


00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.240
I think I felt so encouraged by the Python community,


00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.880
people that came up to me and really appreciated


00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.200
what I had to say and that made me feel more engaged


00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.200
and wanted me to do it again.


00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.640
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, fantastic.


00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.680
What was it on?


00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.480
- It was on improving the transportation networks


00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.060
using Python.


00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.960
As a data scientist for Trimble Transportation,


00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.680
I work in the transportation industry


00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.000
and they face a lot of problems in terms of reducing waste,


00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.420
optimizing their networks,


00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.520
and that's what my team at Trimble do day to day.


00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.980
So I needed to share with the Python community,


00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.020
the kinds of things that we do


00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:13.140
and try to really get at the core of it.


00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.200
And show that we use really a lot of Python to do it.


00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.340
- That sounds awesome.


00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.460
I'm just kind of wondering as you're telling me that,


00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.940
do you get extra frustrated at traffic jams and stuff?


00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.780
'Cause you know behind the scenes


00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.820
how much it could be better.


00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.020
- I get frustrated at when my Amazon package


00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:29.860
doesn't come on time.


00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.180
- Yeah, okay.


00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.940
But then again, I also feel a lot of empathy too,


00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.100
because I know these drivers that are driving.


00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:37.940
It's a lot.


00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.360
- I think like half the traffic in the world


00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.980
might actually be Amazon drivers.


00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.300
(laughing)


00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.220
But anyway, more, here hold on, let me move this real quick.


00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.060
There we go.


00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.500
Tell me about what you thought this year.


00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.740
It seems like the conference,


00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.140
people really happy to be back,


00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.620
but what stood out for you?


00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.900
- I think what stood out for me


00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.700
is the number of new attendees we still got.


00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.700
- Yeah, quite a few, yeah.


00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.820
- Quite a few, and it's pretty amazing


00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.820
because there were a lot of layoffs and economic struggles.


00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:13.000
And the conferences, it's not like you're all free,


00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.700
but people still came.


00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.220
And I think that's partly due to the PSF


00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.900
and the great work they do with their financial program.


00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.540
- Right, some of the scholarships, yeah.


00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.020
- Companies that we see here in the booth


00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.420
really understanding the importance


00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.980
of sending their people out here.


00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.620
So it's really great to see all those first-time attendees.


00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.460
Yeah.


00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.860
- Yeah, excellent.


00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.300
You said you're kind of trying


00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.780
the hallway track out this year?


00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.260
- Yes, that is a secret feature of PyCon.


00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.500
- The one thing not on YouTube, not live stream,


00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.320
none of that.


00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.160
- None of that.


00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.020
And I was at the keynotes with Ned Batch Elder


00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.460
and he really talked about talking to people


00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.940
because we have, and also like Marietta,


00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.620
the chair of PyCon this year,


00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.280
I talked about there's 2000 people here,


00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.920
like over 2000 people here.


00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.020
And this is the only time you're gonna get to talk to them.


00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.580
So I opted, made a conscious effort.


00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.060
- Yeah, sorry, I got cut off there, but the hallway track.


00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:10.900
- Yeah, the hallway track.


00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.940
- 'Cause Ned talked about talking to people.


00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.720
- Yeah, Ned and Mariana talked about talking to people.


00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.300
So I made a conscious effort to try and interact


00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.020
with the fellow people that are walking around


00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.080
this hallways and this expo booth


00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.000
and does get into on this.


00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.540
And I really got a lot of like really nice interactions.


00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.700
I met up with old friends, people I met at PyCon,


00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.600
that we're gonna do activities together and all that stuff.


00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.680
So it's been really, really, really like fruitful.


00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.520
- Yeah, awesome.


00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.000
Well, great to run into you.


00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.120
- Same, likewise.


00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.040
- Yeah, yeah, thanks for taking the time


00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.960
to talk to everyone and sharing your experience.


00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.000
- Bye guys. - Bye.


00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.840
- Bye.


00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.660
- Hey, Sean.


00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.500
- Hey, Mike, how's it going?


00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.800
- It's fantastic to see you again.


00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.640
And in person, imagine that.


00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.400
- I know, first time in a few years, it's been great.


00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.840
- It has, since the before times.


00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.680
- I know, right?


00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.200
- Since the before times.


00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.040
But here we all are back together at PyCon.


00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.880
Yeah, it's great.


00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.700
Before we get into it,


00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.200
just tell people quickly about yourself.


00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.440
- Sure. - Fellow podcaster.


00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.880
- Sure, so my name's Sean Tyber.


00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.680
I'm a senior cloud engineer at Mondelēz International,


00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.780
which nobody knows except for we make all of the Oreos


00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.300
and the Nilla wafers and Cadbury chocolates,


00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.520
all the good stuff.


00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.960
And we also do a lot of really cool stuff in the cloud.


00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.160
So I'm also the co-host of the Teaching Python podcast.


00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.520
I feel like I'm missing my right arm


00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.520
Kelly couldn't make it this time.


00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.520
- Shout out to Kelly.


00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.520
Kelly, you should be here.


00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.520
We miss you.


00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.520
- Yeah, well, we'll get her next year, you know.


00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.520
- Yes, exactly.


00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.640
- Yeah, and just here running the education summit on Thursday and attending the rest


00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.640
of the conference and enjoying it like any other Pythonista.


00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.920
- How was the education summit?


00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.920
- It's amazing.


00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.240
We had some wonderful speakers, educators coming from all over the country, from all


00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.560
over the world.


00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.280
We had people speaking from as far away as South Korea at the education summit, and it's


00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.960
It's the one time of year when people who are teaching computer science and teaching


00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.920
Python specifically get a chance to come together and talk about what they do with other people.


00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.600
It's just a unique experience.


00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.600
Yeah, it's excellent.


00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.080
And if you're teaching actual students, it's hard to get away, right?


00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.520
You've got the school year and you've got a structure on that, so it's a big deal.


00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.200
Yeah, it's been a great experience.


00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.560
We did some workshops talking about the impact of generative AI on education, some of the


00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.720
implications of that, and just tried to figure out what it's going to look like in the future.


00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.320
So what did you decide, Chet, GPT is going to do to our education system?


00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:27.160
Well, we still have way more questions than we have answers, but we also are looking at


00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.920
it from the lens of there have been other tools that have transformed education.


00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.200
Calculators were supposed to ruin the teaching of math, and yet we figured that out.


00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.120
So we're confident we can do the same here.


00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.200
Same thing for search and the internet also kind of broke it, right?


00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.880
How are you going to test if people know history?


00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.280
If they can just type in, when was the war of 1812?


00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.280
Right.


00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.280
what we found is that these are skills that we can teach.


00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.860
We can teach students how to search more effectively,


00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.080
how to find things, how to solve problems.


00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.120
And I think with generative AI,


00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.120
it's about how to evaluate what's happening,


00:30:59.120 --> 00:30:59.960
what you're asking for,


00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.000
and making sure that it is appropriate


00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.640
to the problem you're trying to solve.


00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.760
- How do you ask good questions,


00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.320
and then how do you assess whether it's real,


00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.160
whether it's ed?


00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.000
- Exactly. - Interesting.


00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.160
All right, well, what stood out for you


00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.000
at the show so far?


00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.820
How's it been?


00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.000
- I mean, it's the people.


00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.100
Like always, it's the people getting to see everyone,


00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.760
getting to have those great conversations,


00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.200
to sit down and have lunch together and talk about things


00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.860
and just, I find myself looking at everyone's badges


00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.080
to figure out where they're coming from


00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.640
and what kind of cool work they're doing.


00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.160
And I'm just curious about how they're using Python


00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.240
and how I could connect with them


00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.560
and make something cool happen together.


00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.520
- It's always surprising.


00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.420
You run into such cool people.


00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.760
And that is my favorite part as well.


00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.520
It's just kind of the, honestly, the hallway track.


00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.560
I know, not dissing the speakers.


00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.360
I'm looking forward to those talks on YouTube,


00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.540
but it's the parts that are not recorded


00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.940
and are spontaneous that really make it


00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.940
worth coming to, I think.


00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.780
- That's true.


00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.940
And I've been enjoying the talks too.


00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:57.020
There's been some really phenomenal talk tracks this year.


00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:01.400
We're just seeing, I think, a new wave of energy


00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.100
coming out of the pandemic.


00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.880
And I can't wait to go to Pittsburgh next year


00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.720
and do this all again.


00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.660
- I know, that'd be awesome.


00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.020
Well, thanks for taking the time to share your experience.


00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.060
- It's my pleasure, Michael, thanks.


00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:11.900
- You bet, bye.


00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:12.720
- Bye.


00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.560
- Hey, Chris.


00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.200
Really good. Really good. Enjoying PyCon. How about you?


00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.880
I am having an absolute blast here.


00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.240
It's always fun, isn't it?


00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:28.440
Oh, it's... This is my favorite conference. The energy, the vibe, the people, the willingness


00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:34.520
to share is bar none the best conference that I've ever attended. And I've been to a lot.


00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:39.880
Yeah, I know you have. It really is unique in that regard. Tell people quickly about yourself.


00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:45.560
Hey everybody, my name is Chris Williams. I am the host of the vBrownBag podcast.


00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.440
I'm a dev rel manager for HashiCorp and an AWS hero.


00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:55.560
Yeah, awesome. And I've been on your brown bag a few times. That's been very fun.


00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.760
You're a friend of the vBrownBag show. I am a friend of Talk Python.


00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.240
That is right. Yeah, we're all friends here. It's amazing.


00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:01.740
Yay.


00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:06.920
So, how's this conference going for you? How is it in 2023?


00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:14.760
It's been going really well. I'm glad that there's a bit more energy than last year. There's more


00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:21.960
interest. I think people are just exuberant to be out of the house and meeting new folks


00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.920
and getting back into the vibe of the before times. What are we good for?


00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.800
We miss people, right?


00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.760
Yeah, exactly.


00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.480
Zoom is fine.


00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.360
But it's not a patch on actually hanging out with folks.


00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.800
It's not a replacement. That's right.


00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.520
Correct. Yeah, totally.


00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:42.040
So what's your game plan here? Are you on hit all of the talks? Are you on hallway track? Are you


00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:46.360
trying to get all the swag? What's going on here? So I'm actually changing it up a little bit this


00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:53.160
year. I love the hallway track and meeting folks. So I found an entire contingent of people in


00:33:53.160 --> 00:34:01.960
Boston that I didn't even know were out there. The keynotes have been... I am now trying to find


00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:08.680
ways to improve my public speaking. So paying attention to truly good folks like James and Ned


00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:14.440
and their keynotes were masterclasses in presentation and humorous pauses and things


00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.760
like that. And so I'm furiously scribbling down notes like, "Oh, that sounded great. I'm going


00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:24.440
to try that." - Yeah, you can watch the talks, you can attend the talks, or you can study the talks.


00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.920
Whenever I go there, as somebody who's done a ton of public speaking, I'm like, "That was nice." I


00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.920
I don't know if people caught that, but they appreciated that.


00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.420
Yes.


00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.880
So yeah, that's good.


00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.920
So I'm doing the keynotes as a study session.


00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.160
I am doing the hallway track.


00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:44.200
Generally, if something is going to be recorded, I will catch it after the fact.


00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:48.440
So I tend to not do them unless there's something that I want to talk to the


00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.040
presenter about, like on the spot, then I will tend that.


00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.200
But I'm just trying to catch up with some friends.


00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.360
a good friend of mine spent an inordinate amount of time teaching me new things in Python over the


00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:07.000
past couple of days. He's a contributor, and he was showing me some stuff that as a newbie


00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.640
developer, I'm kind of too dumb to know the right questions to ask. And I know that people don't


00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.080
like saying you're too dumb. Nobody's too dumb. >> There's no dumb questions. But, well, you do


00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.960
need to sort of find your way, right? >> The questions that I don't know I need to ask yet.


00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.960
- Yeah, sure. - Exactly.


00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.840
So, yeah, it's just been really good to catch up with folks,


00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.680
learn new things, and absorb as much as humanly possible in three days.


00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.520
Ah, yeah, it is tiring, but it's fun.


00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.960
- Converse is fun, after parties are fun. - Yep, yep.


00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.160
Yeah, really, really good stuff, so thanks.


00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.400
Before I let you out here, what in Python are you excited about right now?


00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.680
So, I'm gonna be checking out the new releases in 3.12.


00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.120
They're making some announcements on fStrings that I need to dig into.


00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:55.480
like that we're making f-strings better. I'm like, okay, how? So I'm gonna be doing a lot of googling


00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:00.440
after everything is said and done to figure it out. And as a content creator myself, I will be


00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:07.400
spending a lot of time parsing through the stuff that I've been making and just finding new ways to


00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:12.520
reach out to people, get content. I mean, I don't know about you, but for me, this whole


00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.520
experience is a great way to find interesting people to talk to. You could have people on


00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:21.400
V. Brown bag, right? There's a bunch of resumes they didn't know they submitted to you.


00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:27.160
Mike: Oh, absolutely. I've been scribbling down names and my little notepad on my phone


00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.840
is filling up furiously as I find people to pester after this.


00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.480
RG: Awesome. Well, thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts.


00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.440
Mike: Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it.


00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.800
RG: Yeah, you bet. Bye. Hey, Ray.


00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.440
Ray McLendon (00:01:00): Hey.


00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.080
RG: How are you doing?


00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.120
Ray McLendon (00:01:01): I'm doing wonderful.


00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.400
RG: Great to meet you.


00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.760
Ray McLendon (00:01:03): You as well. Yes, yes, yes.


00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.600
RG: Thank you. Tell people quick who you are, a bit about yourself.


00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.480
Let's see. So I'm Ray McLendon. I'm actually a data scientist at the Kansas City Fed.


00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.880
I mostly work in natural language processing, that kind of fun stuff.


00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.200
Yeah. Oh, that sounds really awesome. Yeah. So just talking to people about


00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.520
their PyCon experience and how many times you've been here?


00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:08.760
So this is my second PyCon. My first one was last year, sort of like right on the back of


00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.000
everybody getting back together from the pandemic.


00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.320
Yeah. So I'm not sure how representative your experience was last time. It was a little,


00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:21.400
a little different, but how was it this year? Oh, I'm really enjoying it. I actually gave a


00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:28.280
tutorial this year, which was exciting. Feature engineering is for everyone. So trying to just


00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.040
kind of share our knowledge of feature engineering, I co-presented that with a,


00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.440
with a coworker of mine, Leah. And yeah, it was fantastic. We had a great time.


00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.960
Yeah. You had a good experience doing it? Absolutely. Looking forward to doing it again.


00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.260
Cool.


00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.400
And what library is that like PyTorch or what was it?


00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.840
Oh, that's really interesting.


00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.400
So it was a mix.


00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.980
There was some exploration with Y data profiler.


00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:51.720
Okay.


00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.180
And then there was building various features.


00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:01.740
Some of it was kind of just using pandas or NumPy and scikit-learn.


00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:06.180
We use some of the libraries for feature engineering that are built into that.


00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.820
So it was a mix of libraries.


00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:08.020
Yeah.


00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:08.900
Cool.


00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.040
Well, what stood out to you so far this year?


00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:18.460
Well, I guess the interesting part that I did was I went to open spaces.


00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.880
I didn't do that the previous year.


00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.580
And I went to one this year around civic data.


00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.520
So that was really fascinating.


00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:24.820
Yeah.


00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:25.120
Yeah.


00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:31.780
Enjoyed the real community vibe and learning about, I guess, honestly, how


00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.640
difficult it is to get your hands on civic data, quite frankly.


00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:34.800
Yeah.


00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:39.120
I can imagine that it is, but you know, we can complain a lot about


00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.080
the government and systems.


00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.880
And that's easy to do, but at the same time,


00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.600
like we have all this technology and all this data


00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.000
and people can really put in, you know, make a difference.


00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.480
You know, I see actually the US Digital Services


00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.820
have a booth over there, right?


00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.500
And that's kind of like trying to bring people in


00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.680
from industry to say like, look, you built Instagram,


00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:01.040
now could you help us build something else


00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.440
for the government that we could, so people won't complain.


00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.640
It's kind of cool, actually.


00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.680
- Yeah, so they were at the Civic Data Group.


00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.520
- Oh, they were?


00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.760
I hate to say it, I had never heard of the US digital service before.


00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.280
So I was really excited to hear about the efforts and the work that they're doing, including


00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:20.080
some of the best practices guides around UX and UI that they even provide.


00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.520
It's a very cool service.


00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:28.520
I interviewed David on Talk Python years ago, but maybe I should talk to him again.


00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.980
But anyway, it's a cool service.


00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.880
So what stood out to you this year?


00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.360
- Strangely enough, I come to PyCon,


00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.160
I expect some really technical talks, to be honest.


00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.880
That's an expectation.


00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.400
It was really the keynote from the first day with Ted,


00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.160
where he kind of broke down communication.


00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.680
- Yeah.


00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.400
- That strangely, that was the thing


00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.560
that stood out the most to me.


00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.520
- I've heard so many good things from his keynote,


00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.560
and I was doing, preparing for a live event


00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.840
that started the minute it ended,


00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.460
so I couldn't be there, like, oh,


00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.800
but I'm gonna watch it on YouTube,


00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.480
and I'll check it out, so cool.


00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.440
- Absolutely.


00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.900
Yeah, you've been walking around doing the hallway track a little bit as well and joining


00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:05.900
me and people?


00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:06.900
That's right.


00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.900
Yeah, I sure have.


00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:13.200
I've bumped into a few folks and we've been throwing ideas around.


00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.680
You know, I'm really big into the whole GPT thing.


00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.680
Oh, it's crazy.


00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.680
Yeah, it's pretty wild.


00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.680
Yeah.


00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.960
So it's been interesting to see some folks that are really thinking deeply about ethics


00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.160
and security in that space and giving me new ideas to bring back.


00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.160
Yeah, cool.


00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.160
- We have a lot of ML and a lot of AI stuff


00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.240
around here this year.


00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.080
- Alright.


00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.320
- Well, thanks for being on the show.


00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.560
Thanks for taking the time.
