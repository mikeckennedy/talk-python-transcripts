00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
- Hello YouTube, hello Michael.


00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.040
- Hello Michael.


00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.280
- It's great to have you here.


00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.640
We're gonna talk databases, it's gonna be so fun.


00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.080
- We are, thank you for having me,


00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.440
I'm looking forward to it.


00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.280
- Absolutely.


00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.800
All right, folks out there in the audience,


00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.740
feel free to ask questions if you're watching live.


00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.720
Thanks for watching the replay


00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.440
if you're watching afterwards.


00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.480
And with that, let's kick it off.


00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.380
Michael, welcome to Talk Python to Me.


00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.640
- Thank you, thank you for having me.


00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.960
It's a pleasure.


00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.200
- Yeah, it's a pleasure to have you.


00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.080
I'm honestly pretty psyched to talk about database stuff.


00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.240
I feel like databases are these magical centerpieces


00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.400
of so many applications,


00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.400
and yet, yet they are so unoptimized in many situations


00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600
that if you could just sprinkle a few of these ideas


00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.400
that we're gonna talk about on them,


00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.640
they'll make the entire app and the entire experience


00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.440
for everyone involved better, right?


00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.640
Easier for the developers to have code that goes fast


00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.800
if their queries are fast,


00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.640
customers will be happy that it's not like, wait, did I click the button? Oh, yeah, it's still


00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.560
spinning. That's right. You know, like all of these experiences, just like every time I have them,


00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.040
I'm just like, remain calm. Somebody didn't put an index somewhere. There should have been one. And


00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.440
if this thing will probably work eventually, I don't know if you have those feelings as you go


00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.800
around the web. Yes, 100%. I might have taken it a bit far in trying to fix them. But yes,


00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.640
I'm going to send a support request and here's the explain document that I've come up with


00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.640
for you.


00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.640
Fantastic.


00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.640
All right.


00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.600
Well, we're going to dive into specifically Postgres, but we were chatting a bit before


00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.440
we hit record.


00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.760
And this much of this guidance expands beyond Postgres, right?


00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.680
Even beyond relational potentially.


00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.920
Yeah, absolutely.


00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.400
And going back to something you said just briefly then, the beauty of databases is they've


00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.180
worried so much about performance and you can get up and running, you can get a lot


00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.680
of performance out of them without doing even the basics right sometimes.


00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.040
But at a certain scale that starts to fall down.


00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.600
So yeah, once you're past the first few stages, quite often the performance problems you're


00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.560
hitting tend to be database related.


00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.000
So yeah, that's what I'm excited about.


00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.800
But it's not, yes, most of my recent experiences with Postgres, but the performance is mostly


00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.900
about trying to work out how to do less work or how to not do the work in the first place.


00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.080
And that's the same whether you're, whichever database you're working with, or yeah, data


00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.440
in general, basically.


00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.680
Yeah, databases seem magical.


00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.240
They take all this data and they come up with answers incredibly quickly, but they're not


00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.240
magical.


00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.660
and then they know how to sort of estimate


00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.920
and plan those together and take guesses.


00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.920
And our conversation today will be how to understand


00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.200
those different things that databases can do,


00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.080
how we can interrogate them


00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.480
to tell us what they're trying to do


00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.560
and then what changes we can make to make them faster


00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.360
and some tools along the way.


00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.160
But before we do that, how'd you get into databases


00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.000
and being associated with databases?


00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.200
- Yeah, so I'm gonna start with the database.


00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.640
being associated with PG Mustard and all the stuff you're doing?


00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640
Yes.


00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.760
So I, it goes back in university, I studied mathematics.


00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.760
So that involved a tiny bit of programming, but really not much, just a little bit of


00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.400
statistics that I quickly dropped.


00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.600
Tiny bit of mechanics that I dropped as well.


00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600
Very pure.


00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.320
There must be something about math in the air.


00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.120
The last three episodes I've done have all been like people with PhDs in math and doing


00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.200
all sorts of interesting stuff. So and I have a math background as well. But yeah.


00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.480
Amazing.


00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.280
Yeah, it is. So it started in math. Yeah.


00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.800
Yeah, absolutely. No PhD here. But I then went to a... Well, I thought I wanted to be a management


00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.320
consultant for my sins back in the day. And then the financial crisis happened. So luckily,


00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.840
that got scuppered. And I ended up finding a job at a company called Red Gate, which


00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.240
I understand you're actually familiar with.


00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.200
So they did database tools, and were predominantly for SQL Server, but also developer tools for


00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.240
.NET as you've seen, and then expanded out from there.


00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.520
So I started at a time where their most popular product was called SQL Compare for comparing


00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.080
databases.


00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.520
And just a few months into when I was there, they launched a product called SQL Source


00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.520
Control.


00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.120
So it got into kind of the change management side of things.


00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.120
And luckily got so many opportunities there to do various roles and landed mostly in product


00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120
management.


00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.040
Luckily, got a chance to take on their Oracle tools team.


00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.320
So it's a tiny team compared to the rest of the company.


00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.160
And it was the first foray into their tools for Oracle.


00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.600
We also span off a couple of tools for MySQL as well.


00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.960
And in working in that small team, we started to see, I wouldn't say the rise of Postgres


00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.640
because it's been going for so long, but the kind of the resurgence and the slow and steady


00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.080
improvements from that. So yeah, that's that was my kind of first five years of getting


00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.240
to know databases. And then what a cool place to do it, right? I mean, there are some very


00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:32.640
hot database companies, you know, Postgres, the MongoDB folks, obviously, Oracle, Microsoft,


00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.300
where they make them, but then there's only a few places


00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.800
where they really say, and what was missing?


00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.260
Let's just fix all of that, right?


00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.740
Let's make the developer experience


00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.180
really right on databases.


00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.740
And I feel like Redgate was very much like that,


00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.180
like SQL Compare and the source control stuff.


00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.080
That was all very neat.


00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.920
- Yeah, absolutely. - Probably still is.


00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.740
I haven't touched it for a while,


00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.060
but I don't mean to speak of it totally in the past.


00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.620
That's my experiences that was in the past.


00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.660
- Yeah, and they're doing some cool things now.


00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.660
They're doing some of their products across database now.


00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.140
They're doing some Postgres things.


00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.900
They acquired FlywayDB, which a lot of people use.


00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.500
But yes, the thing that first attracted me to them


00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.740
was their slogan, believe it or not.


00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.120
It was ingeniously simple software,


00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.860
which is something about,


00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.340
I guess it's the math background as well,


00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.060
about getting to a simple solution.


00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.940
And we've talked about databases sometimes feeling magic.


00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.700
But even if you realize they're not magic,


00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.020
they're still complicated or there's certain complexity


00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.300
to dealing with them.


00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.620
And if you can make that easier for folks,


00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.980
or at least help them with better defaults,


00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.580
like people designing databases are exceptionally smart


00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.580
and they pick the defaults for a reason.


00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.700
But in the real world,


00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.860
sometimes you can afford to be slightly less conservative


00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.660
or choose a certain perspective on something


00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.740
and make a tool that's only for a certain subset


00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.260
of the users. So you can be a bit more opinionated as a tools vendor versus a platform provider.


00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.940
And I like that kind of space where you can differentiate a little bit more on usability


00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:14.260
and performance, maybe a little bit less on the absolute fundamentals.


00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:20.180
Sure. Well, there's so many different situations in which databases are used, right? Are you


00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.780
Google? Are you talk Python? Or are you a single little app that one person is using?


00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:32.780
Like these are all very unrecognizable to each other in significant ways.


00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.880
Yeah absolutely and the mad thing is they can all run off the same type of database.


00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.880
So you could run.


00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.880
Yeah that is mad.


00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880
Yeah.


00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.380
Yeah that's a really good point that you can run off.


00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.020
Basically everyone installs the same database, does some sort of schema creation thing and


00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.500
goes from there.


00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:01.060
Absolutely. Or even Mongo, right? Run well. I think that's the key thing. Run well, probably


00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:08.260
most I mean, Facebook still runs off, albeit an admittedly highly modified, very impressive


00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:15.380
MySQL setup. And I think just today we saw a couple, well, maybe in the last two days,


00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:23.060
we've seen a couple of really impressive companies launching SQLite on the edge, you know, so there's


00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:31.420
Really, pretty much any database that's made it to this point can probably support you


00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.420
at any scale if you know enough about it or if you want it well.


00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.420
Yeah, for sure.


00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.420
How interesting.


00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:45.460
All right, now before we get into optimizing these, first let's get the order right.


00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.780
Understanding the performance and then optimizing, right?


00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.220
Not take a shot at optimizing and then we'll figure out if we got the right spot.


00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.980
like profiling and performance optimization of code.


00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.660
Let's just talk for a minute about


00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:04.260
of we were no matter what,


00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.880
GUI tools for managing databases.


00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.820
Because I saw that you were using


00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.380
in some presentations you're doing,


00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:16.380
you're using DBeaver, which is pretty interesting.


00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.460
And I feel like a lot of people


00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.120
don't end up using these tools.


00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.700
So maybe you could highlight a couple


00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.900
that I think sort of stand out for just interesting database stuff.


00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.980
I mean, coming from a tool vendor, of course.


00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.980
Yeah, no, go ahead.


00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:33.980
- I do apologize.


00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.420
I got a tiny bit of lag there.


00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:44.340
But yes, so if you can hear me clearly, then I do like dbeaver for doing demos.


00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.900
It's very easy to run multiple queries in a row that you don't have to type out or copy


00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.140
paste around.


00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:59.780
It's also exceptional for post GIS, which is for geographic data.


00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:05.140
I know a few people are really keen on its visualizations for that.


00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:11.300
I tend to not use it day to day anymore, but only because there's so many tools out there


00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.700
that you can use.


00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:19.140
I think you've listed a few, but a lot of people are very keen on the default one that


00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.180
that ships with Postgres called PSQL,


00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.060
which is a command line interface.


00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.660
Very, very powerful.


00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.500
Can do a lot of things that other tools can't,


00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.900
but has quite a steep learning curve in my opinion.


00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.900
There's some people doing really good tutorials on,


00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:39.340
I think Leticia is doing some really good conference talks


00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.620
at the moment on this and has done them in the past


00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.660
and has a website around PSQL tips.


00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.420
So yeah, there's loads of good gurus out there.


00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.060
My, at the moment I'm using a really modern one


00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.060
called ArchType, only recently launched,


00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:01.740
but I tend to try out tools probably earlier than most would.


00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.300
- But wait, this looks nice.


00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.140
- Right?


00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.300
(laughing)


00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.460
- It's real nice.


00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.460
ArchType, A-R-C-T-Y-P-E.com.


00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.580
- You got it.


00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.820
- Yeah, right on.


00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.500
This is cool.


00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.100
Okay, and this works on the different databases


00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.100
that you might.


00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:23.360
So they stripped back down to a couple, maybe a year or two ago.


00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:29.860
So it was Postgres and MySQL, I believe, but I think they're adding some back in.


00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.480
Not 100% sure though, sorry.


00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.040
I'm Postgres through and through.


00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.300
Yeah, it solves the problem.


00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.240
What else do we need to worry about, right?


00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.240
Absolutely.


00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.520
And if we're talking specifics, actually, because I'm on Postgres on a Mac, I think


00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:48.800
probably the best long-lived option and one that's been around for years, I would say


00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:56.180
is Postico, which is a Mac-only app. But, yes, it's lightning fast, which I -- so Postico


00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.180
with an O at the end.


00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:07.620
>> Cool. Okay. Oh, Mac-only. Okay. Yeah, that's pretty nice. But this other one, this


00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.820
archetype looks really nice.


00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.380
that looks on everything, right?


00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.340
- No, no, of course, you're absolutely right, they're not,


00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.060
but they need to work well.


00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.500
So the two others that I was gonna throw out there


00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.500
that are kind of nice, this one clearly is not for Postgres


00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.620
because it's DB browser for SQLite.


00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.700
But at the same time, I feel like a lot of people


00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.180
are interested in databases, generally not just Postgres,


00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.220
right, you can come across SQLite all over the place.


00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.140
So I think this one is nice, this one is free.


00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.740
And then have you done anything with Bkeeper?


00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.500
No, I have seen it around.


00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.100
- Yeah, Beekeeper's pretty nice.


00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.180
It gives you like auto-complete for your queries


00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.120
and ways to explore your schemas.


00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.500
But what it seems to not have really


00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:56.500
is any sort of exploration of the schema visually, right?


00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.260
There's not like a UML looking diagram type thing, so.


00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.540
- Yeah, one last one before we,


00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.180
I think a company that are doing great things


00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.740
in ID space in general, JetBrains,


00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.900
and their DataGrip product is very good as well.


00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.580
And very, very cross-platform in terms of different support


00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.780
for different databases.


00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.900
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.580
I think, yeah, DataGrip is really great, right?


00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.820
Like if you use PyCharm, for example,


00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.540
and when you're doing the database features of PyCharm,


00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.100
it really is just DataGrip, right?


00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.860
If you just want the standalone edition.


00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.420
So super cool.


00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.700
Yeah, these are all really nice.


00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.580
and I discovered a few myself as well from this.


00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.260
So, awesome.


00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.820
I just think it's kind of important


00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.420
for people to have these tools


00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.500
and maybe you end up just on CLI tools like PSQL,


00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.100
but when you're starting,


00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.660
I think that that can be the difference of,


00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.820
I can do this or I can't do this.


00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.660
You know what I mean?


00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.580
Rather than efficiency.


00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.620
People might just look at it and go,


00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.780
that's too much for me, I'm out.


00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.900
- Yeah, well, it's also about discovery.


00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.060
I think sometimes you don't know what's there


00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.940
on what's possible and in a command line tool,


00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.140
it's really on you to figure that out.


00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.220
Whereas in a GUI, they can leave you hints,


00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.020
they can show you the tree of things.


00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.380
You can start to realize what is and isn't possible.


00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.740
And they've got a lot more freedom to educate you


00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.900
as a new user, whereas in a command line tool,


00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.200
there's very little they can do on that front.


00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:35.260
So yeah, not all of the GUIs take advantage of that,


00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.780
but the good ones. - The possibility is there.


00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.220
Yeah, the good ones.


00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.780
All right, I was talking about schema


00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.300
and I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.


00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.100
I'm sure you're more well versed in it than I am.


00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:51.100
When I think about schemas, I think about the tables,


00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.540
the maybe the columns, the types of columns that are there.


00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.380
So this one is a Varchar 16,


00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.980
this one is a float or whatever.


00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.980
Would you consider indexes part of the schema?


00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.740
- I would, yes.


00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.480
- Yeah, okay.


00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.580
- I think, yeah, I guess it depends on,


00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.200
definitions are hard.


00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.000
Two mathematicians discussing definitions,


00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.100
how long have you got?


00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:24.620
But I guess when I'm thinking about schema changes


00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.080
and deployment scripts and things like that,


00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.920
I think it's just as important


00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.320
for the functioning of your app.


00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.480
An index existing or not


00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.520
can be the difference between you effectively being up


00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.840
or being down.


00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.600
And if it's that important, then I'd probably say it does.


00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.880
It is integral.


00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.760
>> For sure.


00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.000
Quick audience question from William.


00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.040
What's the most powerful utility you personally


00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.960
got out of PSQL?


00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.400
>> Good question.


00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.920
>> What's the most powerful thing


00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.520
you find yourself doing with PSQL,


00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.400
maybe is a good way to phrase it.


00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:17.900
So, yeah, I actually don't, it feels like I'm probably not the best person to ask.


00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.140
I tend to use it for really quick things.


00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:25.960
So it's more of like, it's by far the easiest and quickest to throw a quick query into and


00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.280
get a really quick result back out of.


00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.360
There's zero load time or anything like that.


00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.360
Right.


00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.360
And you get text output straight back.


00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.360
You don't have to worry about any formatting or anything.


00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:45.360
Right. Open your terminal, type psql, some query, you see the answers right there.


00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:52.360
Yeah. But that's not like, there's probably people ripping their hair out and screaming at the screen saying,


00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.360
"Why didn't you mention this amazing feature of psql?"


00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:00.360
But the truth is I'm not a heavy database user in the grand scheme of things.


00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.960
You know, people doing DBA work.


00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:09.440
I make and help design and run a tools company, not a, like we don't have a massive database.


00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.240
I don't do tons of analytical queries day to day.


00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.280
So those, yeah, it's the DBAs of this world and the people that have got a lot of hands-on


00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.720
database experience probably do a lot more of that.


00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:29.400
But I would, in terms of recommendations, I think Leticia Avereux does a, has a website


00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:35.720
called psql tips and I think if you go to it, it just loads a random tip of about 100


00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.840
and something that she keeps adding to and I think that's a great, like that's a fun


00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.920
way to get some discovery or learn some features in a tool.


00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.920
Yeah, absolutely.


00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.880
All right, you spoke about the being in a tools place.


00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.640
You want to just give a quick shout out to PG Mustard and we'll come back and talk about


00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.640
it more later?


00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640
Yeah, sure.


00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.560
That's sort of the second question I was gonna ask you,


00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.980
or not making a speedy progress, which is great.


00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.400
But, so you were at Redgate,


00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.400
and now you've gone on to start your own company,


00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.080
co-found your own company around database tools.


00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.000
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.920
So I worked at a couple of companies in between,


00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.880
one of which was a big fan of Postgres.


00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.960
So there was a company called GoCardless,


00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.320
and the team there were exceptional,


00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.800
loved my time there,


00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.600
and they ran quite a big payments company


00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.960
by the time I left on a single Postgres database.


00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.680
And it was, yeah, the team were big fans


00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.180
and completely converted me.


00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.240
I was already keen on Postgres or the idea of it


00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.920
from Redgate time and hearing what customers


00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.640
were saying about it.


00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.440
So I was pretty sold on the idea.


00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.280
I loved the platform, I loved how extensive it was,


00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.200
I loved that you could see the source code,


00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.920
you could even contribute back to it.


00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.000
So I was a big fan of the platform.


00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.120
But my first ideas for a business were pretty lukewarm, let's say.


00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.920
So there's a regular product I love called P-SQL.


00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.120
So you mentioned autocomplete in, I think it was Beekeeper.


00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.600
They had an autocomplete tool in SSMS, which is SQL Server Management Studio,


00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.840
which people loved and it's an everyday use tool and you could easily see yourself


00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.600
making it better and better for years.


00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.560
So that was my kind of ideal tool.


00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.140
But building it would have entailed either integrating


00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.580
into the 25 IDs that we've looked at so far,


00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.220
or picking one and really maybe not being that useful.


00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.380
So ended up trying to build something


00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.020
a little bit more standalone.


00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:41.020
And there's a few really good open source query plan


00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:46.380
visualization tools, and they do a lot of work


00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.560
to help you see where the time's going in a query


00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.560
and give you some basic kind of guidance


00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.560
and maybe not basic, maybe super DBA friendly guidance.


00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.760
So it's often built by DBAs for DBAs type tools.


00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.720
- Advanced but maybe basic in his presentation.


00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.560
Something like that, right?


00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.400
It's just like, here's a wall of text.


00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.980
It speaks your language, go figure it out.


00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:11.960
- Yeah, exactly.


00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.280
And I quite often saw in different places,


00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.200
people would post links to them and say,


00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.360
I've put it into this tool,


00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.200
but what can I do to speed it up?


00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.200
So there was clearly still a missing step


00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.160
of what can we do about it?


00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.520
Okay, here's where the time's going,


00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.000
but what can I actually do about that?


00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.440
So tried to build something that would help solve that,


00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.400
solve that problem, and this is what we came up with.


00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.880
- Yeah, it's really cool.


00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.880
And the way it works is you give it explain,


00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.920
you have Postgres explain your query plan to it, to you,


00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.920
and then you give that query plan to bgmustard


00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.560
and it puts it into a graphical form


00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.920
and into a more digestible form.


00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.880
And it's interesting.


00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.080
But what's really interesting is it gives you advice.


00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.840
It says, you know what?


00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.540
This sort is happening without an index


00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.140
and that's where you're spending most of your time.


00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.240
Here's your big opportunity for a win.


00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.400
We'll come back to this, like I said,


00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.400
after we talk about finding these problems.


00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.320
But I just wanna point out,


00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.600
I had, we'd covered this on Talk Python.


00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.740
One of our guests mentioned it.


00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.440
I think it was Henik.


00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.680
And then we also talked about it on Python Bytes.


00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.400
My other show is just one of the topics.


00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.120
And I don't remember which place we talked about it.


00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.800
But somebody made the joke of,


00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.720
oh, this is my new consulting job.


00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.920
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna buy a license to PG Mustard


00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.240
and I'm gonna go around and optimize people's databases


00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.720
by dropping the query plans in here


00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.160
and just taking its advice.


00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.440
which I thought was hilarious, but also plausible.


00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.640
- We have some consultants that use us.


00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.440
- I can imagine.


00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.240
I mean, it's really good visualizations


00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.360
and interesting, often useful advice that it gives.


00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.420
So, all right, that is all super cool,


00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.960
but let's go back more broadly to Postgres,


00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.280
but then maybe even, like I said, more general.


00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.280
I feel like a lot of this applies to


00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.280
MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and even Mongo.


00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.280
So let's just start out about


00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.280
maybe you're the unfortunate person who is running one of these websites


00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.280
that makes me think about the optimizations that were missed


00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.280
as I wait for the spinning thing to load.


00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.280
And it's your job to figure out what is wrong.


00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.280
So maybe we could talk about some of the techniques for finding


00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.280
problems with your database.


00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.280
Let's just start there.


00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.280
My database is slow. Help.


00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.280
Perfect. So


00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.280
a lot of databases


00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.280
will have some version


00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.280
of a slow query log


00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.280
or a built-in


00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.280
monitoring view


00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.280
or you'll have a


00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.280
monitoring tool set up


00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.280
yourself to


00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.280
log and aggregate this kind of thing.


00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.280
And


00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:15.480
Normally the starting point, so I guess there's a few starting points.


00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:20.640
Either customer reports, customer or team member or somebody reports something's slow


00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.800
or your database is on fire.


00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.200
It's you know maxed out on some something.


00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.800
- CPU memory disk, some combination thereof.


00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.960
- Yeah exactly or in the cloud maybe you've run out of your provision.


00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.960
Yeah anyway so there's that.


00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.720
But yeah, let's take the I've got one slow query.


00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.040
So in that case, you probably know or can get


00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.040
from the query log, the actual query that was being run.


00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.000
- Sure.


00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.720
Let me just, yeah, let me just make a little side comment


00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.280
here is like, if you're using an ORM,


00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.360
it can be a little bit harder to see what that is, right?


00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.040
You might have to attach some kind of real time


00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.760
logging tool to the database or get it to log it to a file


00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.600
and go track it down.


00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.780
But also, a lot of the ORMs have features


00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.200
that you can make it spit out the queries


00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.760
like in super verbose mode.


00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.160
So for example, SQLAlchemy, when you create the engine,


00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.140
you can say echo equals true,


00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.400
but it's not just SQLAlchemy,


00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400
you can do it with many of them,


00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.240
and it'll start printing the queries,


00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.000
and maybe that's a place to start, right?


00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.120
- Yeah, absolutely, and some of them have,


00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.320
there's some tools now increasingly


00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.040
that let you even do the explain.


00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.680
So yeah, the first step is get the query,


00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.520
but in some of these frameworks and ORMs,


00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.200
you can even ask for the explain plan directly as well.


00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.800
Increasingly even with,


00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.160
and this is where we start to get a little bit more technical


00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.900
and a bit more database specific,


00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.240
but I think it's the same across many databases,


00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.680
but you want explain will give you the plan


00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.200
of what the database has chosen to be,


00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.360
probably the optimal route to do that query or to get you that data or to


00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.120
insert that data and


00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:21.000
But it if you if you want to get the performance information and get really start to dig into exactly why it's slow


00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.620
you need to run something called explain analyze which will also run the query so


00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:34.840
Be careful around that if you're running kind of big delete or something and probably not run it on production, please please please


00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.020
Why is this delete slow?


00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.380
Oh, wait, why is there no data?


00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.300
It's fast now.


00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:39.860
That's great.


00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.540
Wait, why is it fast?


00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.220
There's no data.


00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.020
Or you go to run it a second time


00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.100
and don't understand why it's not--


00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.300
Yeah, it's different somehow.


00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.500
Yeah, so explain, analyze, we'll run the query behind the scenes.


00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.940
But instead of getting the data-- or instead of, let's say,


00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.300
getting the data back or getting a normal return,


00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:01.060
you get a query plan back with performance data in it


00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.340
with quite a lot of statistics.


00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:09.340
So yes, you just append that to the beginning of your query,


00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:15.240
run it as normal, and then it gives you the query plan.


00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.080
So that's step one is get that information


00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.660
from your database.


00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.980
- Right, and the way that that looks is


00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.620
instead of writing SELECT * FROM table where,


00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.420
you write EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM that,


00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.540
or EXPLAIN ANALYZE, depending on


00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.320
whether you want that timing information, right?


00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.320
- Exactly, so if you have, and this is probably,


00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.760
hopefully not many of you are in this situation ever,


00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.980
but if you have a query that never returns,


00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.700
let's say it's gonna take six hours maybe,


00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.660
you probably wanna get the explain plan,


00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.720
just to get a query plan, because explain analyze


00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.320
is gonna take as long as your query,


00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.280
because it is executing behind the scenes.


00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.440
- It runs it and figures out how much IO it's doing


00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.880
and stuff like that, right?


00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.040
- Yeah, exactly, oh, good question.


00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.080
So to add IO information, at least in Postgres,


00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.120
you need to include an additional parameter.


00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.000
So it would be explain analyze buffers.


00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.520
And this is part of my advice to people is,


00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.600
especially when, well, probably everybody,


00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.380
but especially when you're new,


00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.640
and you might need to ask for help from somebody else,


00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.000
if you add as many parameters you can to that explain,


00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.100
if you're in an IDE, just select them all.


00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.560
Once you're getting timing,


00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.280
there's not that much additional overhead


00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.040
to get in the other information as well.


00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.960
But in Postgres, we recommend buffers for both settings.


00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.760
And there's even a new one


00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.960
that gives you right ahead log information as well.


00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.020
So if you ask for all of it,


00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.320
then you only have to get it once.


00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.240
And even if you have to go to ask,


00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.360
maybe you're pasting that into a tool,


00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.400
but maybe you're asking a colleague for help,


00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.080
they might spot something in that extra information


00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.840
that helps them help you.


00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.400
- Right, right, right, okay.


00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.440
Michael in the audience asked a question which makes me


00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.920
think of my next one here.


00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.960
Says Google Cloud SQL just added some sweet query


00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.320
monitoring and planning visualization.


00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.560
So that's pretty nice.


00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.560
- Yeah, Google Cloud SQL doing some really cool things.


00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.480
They also just recently announced


00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.480
that you can do major version upgrades


00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.760
much more easily now, which they didn't have before.


00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.680
So yeah, the cloud providers are doing


00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.760
some really interesting things.


00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:39.720
The query plan visualization stuff is obviously very interesting to us, but there is a natural


00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.360
trade-off with performance as always.


00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:49.560
There's a trade-off in general between monitoring constantly for these things versus getting


00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.960
them when you need them.


00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.240
There's a small overhead, well I say small, but normally small overhead to constantly


00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.280
profiling constantly monitoring for these things and getting timings does have some overhead.


00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.080
So there is some advice out there to not do this in general for most applications.


00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:12.240
But we have customers that get the query plan for, they don't log it for every query, but they get it


00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:18.080
for every query so that if it's slow, they put it into the logs and it can be investigated later.


00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:43.880
Interesting. Yeah, so my question is, let's suppose I'm going to get some cloud database type thing, right? Managed Postgres, let's say, and I also happen to have Postgres running locally. Or maybe I'm fully insane. And I have SQL lite local, but then Postgres and yeah, that's gonna make make you worry. I'm sure but


00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.640
I run one of these explain analyze plans against them.


00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.640
Are they comparable?


00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:56.840
Do I need to make sure that I pointed at my production system when I'm asking these questions?


00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:01.720
Yeah, let's take, let's start with a Postgres, Postgres example.


00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.280
That's going to be easier.


00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:09.520
And yeah, my main, the main thing that's tricky there is, well, there's a few things to get


00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.520
right.


00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:19.360
Naturally, the schema being as similar as possible is pretty important.


00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.960
The config of the database as well, as similar as possible.


00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.200
So there's a bunch of config changes that you might have made on production that's pretty


00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.400
important to have locally as well, so that the planner's making similar decisions.


00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:39.600
And then the big one that we see people do, sadly, far too often, is having a really tiny


00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:46.200
data set locally. So, you know, generating 100 rows or even worse, inserting three rows


00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:56.600
or not having any data in a table. And databases, as we've discussed, magical or let's say clever.


00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:01.360
And they know that if there's the amount of data is really important to them in terms


00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:08.280
of their choices. So, you mentioned different, I think, the join algorithms. Postgres, for


00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:13.160
Yeah, has multiple join algorithms that can use and if there's very little data, it will


00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.000
choose one that has a very low startup cost.


00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.040
Even if it gets would get expensive at lots of data because it knows there's or it thinks


00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.520
there's not much.


00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:27.160
Whereas in a world it's saying if locally you've got not much data but then on production


00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:32.000
you've got a lot of data, it might choose a different join algorithm.


00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
So the choices it's making are very different depending on the amount of data.


00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.960
So that tends to be the one that trips people up most.


00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.620
But it's not just algorithms, it's also whether it would pick an index or not.


00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.480
That's the one that really confuses people.


00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.760
So you're like, I know there's an index in here, why isn't it using it?


00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.760
Exactly.


00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.120
It's a super common question.


00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.880
And it turns out you've only got 10 rows there.


00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.720
They all fit on a single block.


00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.640
And it's much faster for Postgres just to return that single block to you than it is


00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.600
to look up each entry in an index.


00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.340
So yeah, exactly.


00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.360
- Yeah, okay.


00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.060
So I did wanna give a shout out to a couple of tools


00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.100
for having fake data.


00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.260
Maybe you've got some recommendations as well,


00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.740
but there's really cool tools like this one at makaroo.com.


00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.420
Are you familiar with Makaroo?


00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.700
- I'm not, no.


00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.660
- So what's cool about this,


00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.500
like you can go and generate fake data, right?


00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.300
So of all sorts of things,


00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.400
but one of the problems is like,


00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.940
well, the fake data is too fake.


00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.420
It doesn't look like the right structure


00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.240
or it doesn't validate or, you know,


00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.700
it's also good just for developing things.


00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.460
But like, for example, you can have


00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.300
all sorts of stuff in here and it gives you,


00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.260
it has the thing that's cool is there's a library


00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.000
of types of things that I can get.


00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.140
So I could get like all sorts of stuff to do with cars,


00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.980
that has real car makes and models and years


00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.980
or VIN numbers or credit cards or genders


00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.460
or those types of things.


00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:05.000
And then you can go and you can export the schema


00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.080
as CSV or JSON or a create table SQL insert script,


00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.340
which is pretty cool.


00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.360
So if you need more real data,


00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.440
places like this for generating them or Faker,


00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.800
which is a package for Python and these other ones


00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.020
that you can just make enough real fake data, right?


00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.760
- Yeah, exactly, and this is super powerful


00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.760
in terms of getting as similar data as possible


00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.400
to your production system without having to worry


00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.080
about personal sensitive information.


00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.760
- Yeah, that's a big concern, right?


00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.080
It's like, if you take production data,


00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.520
let's suppose it's not that massive,


00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.080
and you give it to all the developers,


00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.320
somebody's gonna lose it.


00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.720
Somebody's gonna lose their laptop


00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.920
without the drive being encrypted.


00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.080
They're gonna put it on a USB stick to transfer it.


00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.760
that's just like fat 32 with no security


00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.320
or something terrible, right?


00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.320
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.000
And then you might not even want people


00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.020
to even have select access to some of that stuff


00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.220
in certain environments.


00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.460
So yeah, but it's, you know,


00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.660
probably the more important thing in my world is,


00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.240
or the first stumbling block is the sheer amount of data.


00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.440
- Yeah, the number of rows, right?


00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.560
- Yeah, so even if, you know,


00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.240
some of these fields aren't perfect,


00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:30.600
maybe you've got numbers in as names and things like that.


00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.200
It's probably not gonna make a huge difference


00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.440
to performance unless you're really far out


00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.200
in terms of the size of that data.


00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.240
So if you're inserting kind of multi-kilobyte blobs


00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.840
instead of gender,


00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.180
then you're gonna maybe see some differences,


00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:49.000
but not as much as if there were a million rows


00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.120
versus if there were two.


00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.640
So step one is make sure you've got enough.


00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.480
And then step two,


00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.320
maybe if you need to make it a lot more realistic.


00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.000
- Yeah, size and data type,


00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.760
but not necessarily super precise, yeah.


00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.800
- Great point on data type as well, yes,


00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.720
especially when it comes to indexing.


00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.920
- Right, exactly, 'cause indexing a string case


00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.340
and sensitive is different than a number.


00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.920
- Yes, yes, great point on case and sensitivity.


00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.200
The other thing I wanted to call out


00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.640
on the Postgres side of this is it's got


00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.420
a really powerful generate series function


00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:28.620
that can be used to mock up data quite quickly and easily.


00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.300
Not as powerful as some of these,


00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.980
but simpler and built into Postgres already.


00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.860
So that's quite cool.


00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:40.140
And Ryan Booze from Timescale has been doing


00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.240
some quite fancy demos of that,


00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.380
of using that to do quite interesting time series,


00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.660
you know, huge amounts of data being populated via it.


00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.520
So it is surprisingly powerful as well.


00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:58.300
- All right, speaking of time series,


00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.980
Michael asks, "Any tips for storing machine learning


00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.660
"embeddings in Postgres?"


00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.780
Best thing he's seen is storing them as binary blobs.


00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.060
I have no advice here.


00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.140
Sorry, I don't have any experience in it.


00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.620
How about you?


00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.140
- I don't think I fully understood


00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.440
what would be different about it.


00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.300
In terms of binary blobs--


00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:26.600
I think generally what happens with the machine learning stuff is people will train up these


00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.900
models and they just save them as just binary blobs.


00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:37.180
So it's more of a tips for storing binary data perhaps in general.


00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:42.380
So this is second hand.


00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:46.340
This is not something I have direct experience of, but I've read a lot about performance,


00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.160
believe it or not, over the years.


00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:55.160
It seems to me that the advice is in the early days, keep it simple.


00:36:55.160 --> 00:37:00.080
Maybe you want to store blobs in the database, but you could also -- there's very cheap blob


00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:06.600
storage out there, and you can store IDs to those in the database.


00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.480
But if you want to, if you want to only have one tool to start with, you can store them.


00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.880
The database allows you to.


00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.520
There's specific types in Postgres for that.


00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.400
Jason Beef support in Postgres is amazing.


00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.000
And I think probably led to,


00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.200
well, it was partly responsible


00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.040
for why it's popular today, I think.


00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.640
- I think so too.


00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.620
I think people see it as a significant,


00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.200
let's say a really good choice


00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.720
that's like some middle ground


00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.440
between a purely relational database


00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.280
and document databases like Mongo.


00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.920
They're like, but we can kind of have both, right?


00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.400
- Yeah, and I don't even know


00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.240
if you need to say the word kind of,


00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.760
because I think maybe there's, I don't know many,


00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.600
but maybe there's some use cases


00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.880
where Mongo is gonna really outperform Postgres


00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.160
using JSON-B, but I've not seen them


00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.320
and I don't know what they are.


00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.020
So it's super powerful and I guess the key difference


00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.280
between that and pure blob storage is you can index it.


00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.040
So you can, yeah.


00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.680
- You can index it and query it.


00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.920
You can index into, go to this object in JSON


00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.060
and then here and then here.


00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.760
and if they have that value, I want it back as an index.


00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.040
That's the magic.


00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.020
- Right, but it's not as performant


00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.480
as splitting those out into columns in a schema


00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:27.200
and indexing those, but it's a trade-off again.


00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.560
Back to trade-offs.


00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.680
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.000
Do you have a billion of those things or a hundred of them?


00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.720
'Cause if you got a hundred, you're probably fine.


00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.240
I mean, you probably weigh more than a hundred,


00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.560
but billions is there, you might be pushing your luck.


00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.960
Yeah, okay, pretty interesting there.


00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.920
Other real quick shout out just to like another thing that these guys,


00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.840
disclosure, they were sponsors of Talk Python


00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.440
but I found them before they were sponsors.


00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.440
I thought they were cool and started talking to them.


00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.520
It's this place called Tonic that you connect it to your real live data


00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.400
and it will generate like PPI cleaned up or stuff that looks like your real data,


00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.400
but it's not actually your real data.


00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.000
So you sort of base it off of your production data.


00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Anyway, if people are looking for fake data,


00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.600
there's I guess my whole reason of going down that


00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.640
is there's not a lot of choices,


00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.180
not a lot of reasons to not have enough data.


00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.400
There's a lot of options for getting enough data


00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.200
at various versions of realism.


00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.940
- Yeah, good point.


00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.440
- Yeah, all right, so we were talking about,


00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.280
can I run this explain, analyze against my local machine


00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.360
and against, say, compare the results


00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.740
to how it's gonna be in production?


00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.700
So one of your big pieces of advice


00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.120
is make sure you have enough data


00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.200
and data types that are representative and probably relations, right?


00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:51.240
If you're doing joins, like you want to have like similar amount of related data and whatnot.


00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:58.120
Yeah, ideally, but again, in step one, and that website you talked about that has a spinning


00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:03.920
loader, they're going to be fine, you know, they're going to spot their problems without


00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.920
very accurate.


00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.920
Yeah.


00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:11.880
So if a certain, you know, if a foreign key isn't indexed and they're doing a lookup on


00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:15.600
that, they'll notice it even if the distribution is slightly off.


00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:21.840
So yeah, the nice thing about performance is you don't, often you're talking about 10x


00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.120
difference, 100x difference, you know, thousands sometimes.


00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:30.240
All the blog posts talk about, you know, how we made Postgres 20,000 times faster.


00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.240
But it's just-


00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.240
All the stuff was added in an index.


00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.240
Well, there you go.


00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.240
Yeah.


00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.320
And there's other things, right?


00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.400
There are, performance isn't just indexing,


00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.380
but when you're talking about the absolute basics,


00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.000
it's, yeah, it's normally,


00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.440
you're probably gonna get pretty close


00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.440
as soon as you've got even,


00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.280
like as soon as you've not just got 10 rows


00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.440
in your database.


00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.560
- Sure, sure, sure.


00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.760
Okay, so because there were interesting things


00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.240
that you'll find, maybe you'll only find this


00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.080
if you do the buffers also,


00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:08.080
in addition to just analyze is if you're doing a sort


00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.400
and you have a ton of data,


00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.760
it might say there's too much data to sort in memory.


00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.320
So it might do a, what was it called?


00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.000
A merged sort on disk.


00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.960
That's crazy.


00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.560
It writes data to the disk and sorts it as the database.


00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.240
You're like, wait a minute, what is it doing?


00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.640
It's taken out of memory.


00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.480
Are you insane?


00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.300
What is this?


00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.760
- Well, yeah, it's, I mean, it's super clever, as you said,


00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.840
but the alternative is risking an out of memory exception


00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.840
the whole thing should be.


00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:40.280
- Do you want it fast and wrong or write slow and correct and working, right?


00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.960
Like, take your pick, right?


00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.200
At some point, it can't do it otherwise.


00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.040
But that goes back to the real data.


00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.440
If you don't have enough data, you'll never see the problem as it's going to disk because


00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.120
why would three records go to disk?


00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.120
That would be crazy.


00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.120
- Yeah, exactly.


00:41:53.120 --> 00:42:00.960
So, well, this is a really good example because Postgres determines what it would do in memory


00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:07.720
versus on disk by a couple of parameters now, but the main one being work mem or working


00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:15.440
memory and that's set very low for most production workloads. So that's four megabytes by default


00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:21.840
and I've seen a really good one of the top Postgres consultants giving a talk at a conference


00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:27.040
even a few years ago. So this might even be out of date saying they just automatically


00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:32.600
change that to 16 megabytes wherever just always as a starting point and sometimes bump


00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.560
it you know for analytical workloads it could be a lot lot higher than that but they have


00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.760
there's loads of formulas you can see out there but that's an example of a default that


00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.200
probably is a little bit low in Postgres.


00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:49.920
But if it's running on the cheapest server you can get it somewhere like Linode and it's


00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:55.440
got you know 200 megs total well then you you want it to still be right and slow not


00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.240
wrong and crashing or fast and crashing.


00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.160
- Yeah, exactly.


00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:03.840
- Yeah, but you do need to know these defaults.


00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.580
I think part of being successful is like,


00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.040
okay, this is my context.


00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.560
So these are the defaults that make sense.


00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.620
And these are the ones that I should be tweaking.


00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:16.220
So in another presentation I've seen you give,


00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.960
you talked about the process that you go through


00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.320
for finding these,


00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.720
you sort of determine there's a problem,


00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.320
figuring out what it is and then solving it.


00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.920
You want to talk through your process there?


00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.840
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.760
And this is a process I recommend


00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.880
and I'm guilty of not always following,


00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.920
but this helped me as well.


00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.760
So yeah.


00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.640
- Learn the rules first,


00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.720
so then you can break them later.


00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.560
There you go.


00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.920
- Right, exactly.


00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.120
But I tend to regret breaking these actually.


00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.240
So yeah, the first couple,


00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.920
I think we've already covered briefly,


00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.920
were run on a realistic data set.


00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:57.400
and then second one being make use of the parameters that explain has in your database.


00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:04.200
So for Postgres, use as many as your version supports is my, it tends to be my recommendation.


00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.800
So get a lot of information is the short version of that.


00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:15.080
With Postgres query plans, I think, especially if people are used to reading text format


00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:21.280
they'd be very easily forgiven for starting at the English-speaking world, start at the


00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:28.920
top, read left to right, makes loads of sense. But the plans are indented, so they're a list


00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.440
of operations that Postgres is doing, and the first one you see is the last one it does


00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.480
to give you the data back.


00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.360
Think of it like an onion, right? It's the outer shell of the thing that you're being


00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.360
given.


00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.600
Yeah, exactly. It'd be difficult to start in the inside of an onion, wouldn't it?


00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:53.680
So, yes, my advice tends to be, so firstly, you need to know that the plan is executed


00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:59.840
from the most indented inwards, just to be able to understand what's going on.


00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:04.720
But secondly, it reports some really important statistics right at the bottom.


00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:10.400
So the total execution time being an obvious example, but also the amount of time it spends


00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:16.560
on planning, on triggers, and on just-in-time compilation.


00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:25.600
So these are... don't worry if you don't know what all of those mean, I didn't, but those can all,


00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:32.640
in rare cases, be the dominant issue. So if planning time is 300 milliseconds and your


00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:38.080
execution time is one millisecond, but you've got 20 operations that the query's done in that one


00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:43.920
millisecond, you could spend easily an hour trying to understand that entire query plan,


00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.560
maybe more, maybe you've been interrupted a few times, and then you get to the bottom


00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.680
and you see that planning time was the problem the whole time.


00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.000
You're like, I have five seconds, five milliseconds I could possibly save.


00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.760
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.


00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.120
Do things like cache the query plans or stuff like that?


00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.560
Yeah, yes, so that's a whole topic in itself.


00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:11.860
But a lot of a lot of our arms do that kind of thing for you.


00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:19.080
Yeah. But. The the big advice there is not so much on the planning time front, it's more


00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.480
check out that bottom.


00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:24.600
If you're on Postgres, especially check out that bottom section first and look for dominant


00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.720
issues before you spend ages reviewing the rest of the query plan.


00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:32.480
So that's my, that's the third of the five.


00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.800
And the fourth is then the bit that I sometimes mess up


00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.800
and forget to do, which is work out which,


00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:44.960
so if you then have to look through that tree


00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.400
of operations, don't look at any of the statistics


00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.280
until you've worked out where the time is going


00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.760
or where the majority of the work is happening.


00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:05.040
So Postgres especially is difficult in this area because it will report, I think MySQL does the same, I'm not sure about Mongo and others,


00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:10.600
it will report all of the operations including the statistics of their children.


00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:16.120
So you have to do a bunch of subtraction and some slightly more complicated stuff than that, sadly,


00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:22.440
to work out where this time is going and it's very easy to get distracted by a pattern that you've seen before.


00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:28.760
Like, you know, the obvious, the one that gets me and lots of other people is spot a


00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:33.240
sequential scan on a relatively big table and you start to, you just jump to that and


00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.880
think that's probably where the problem is.


00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.280
- Missed index, we're gonna go fix that, yeah.


00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:42.160
- Exactly, but in a big enough query, a scan of even a few hundred thousand rows might


00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.600
be the, especially if it's returning most of them, might be optimal.


00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.320
Or it definitely might not be the bottleneck.


00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.400
There might be bigger problems.


00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:57.280
So yeah, my advice is work out where the time's going or the work's being done first.


00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:02.320
And then the last step is once you've found like, is there a big bottleneck?


00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.920
Where's the time going?


00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:12.000
Then narrow down into looking at just that operational, that cluster, that subtree.


00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Like and it could be a programming pattern.


00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.960
It could be, well, this query is returning 200,000 rows.


00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.120
when it gets back to the app,


00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.400
the app is iterating over the first 10


00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.640
and deciding it's had enough, right?


00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.640
But meanwhile.


00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.500
- Yeah, and yeah, exactly.


00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:35.160
So yeah, I mean, it could be that.


00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.760
- Yeah, and the fix would be a simple limit 10


00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.600
and skip a certain amount.


00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.920
Like you just put paging in the app as part of the query


00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.020
and you're good to go.


00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.740
- Yeah, exactly.


00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:45.880
Pagination's huge,


00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.800
especially once you've got good indexing.


00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.800
can be so, so powerful.


00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.800
But yeah, I mean, to be fair, we're probably,


00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.800
this process is mostly for a query that you've


00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:01.800
worked out is slow and you want to make faster, and that would be a great example.


00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.800
But then there are also other application side things, so it might not be that any of


00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.800
these queries are slow necessarily, but you're firing off


00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:13.800
the typical N+1 example, you're firing off a lot when you


00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:18.240
you don't need to, you could, instead of going, doing a lot of round trips, or...


00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.920
Yeah, instead of doing like an eager join, eager load on an ORM relationship, you're


00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.560
doing, I got a 50 of these back, and then I'm doing the relationship 50 times. Yeah.


00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.560
Yeah, exactly.


00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:34.480
Yeah, and that echoing out the database calls of your ORM, you'll just see stuff ripping


00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.440
by like, why is there so much database stuff here? This seems insane. And they're like,


00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:43.600
well, n plus one. That's the problem. Really quick, I want to just follow up on that. There


00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.880
There was a question out in the audience saying,


00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.400
what would you like to use?


00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.960
Would you wanna use maybe Postgres and SQLAlchemy


00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.920
or PsychoPG2, maybe the async version these days


00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.320
would be really nice to use.


00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.840
I said, well, you might also consider a SQL model,


00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.480
but with either of those, SQL model,


00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.040
both on top of SQLAlchemy or just SQLAlchemy,


00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.480
the question was, can it handle getting millions of rows


00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.240
back in a short amount of time?


00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.520
Yes and no.


00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.180
I like to hear what your experience is with this,


00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.420
Michael, if you have any.


00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:21.080
What I've seen is a lot of times the database


00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.080
will really quickly give those results back


00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.880
and actually even ship them over the network to the app.


00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.520
But the deserialization of like, here is a record


00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.080
and I'm gonna make a class out of it,


00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.000
and here's a record and you're making a million classes


00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.920
and then setting probably 10 properties on each one of them.


00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.900
You know, 10 million assignments, like that's,


00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.280
it doesn't matter how fast your database is gonna be,


00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:47.160
just don't return 10 million rows into an RM almost ever.


00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.320
Very, very rarely, let's say.


00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.200
- Yeah, exactly.


00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.760
The general advice I think is


00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.960
if you're gonna be doing aggregation work,


00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.840
try to do it database side.


00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.240
They're designed to do that stuff.


00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.720
They have incredibly smart algorithms built into them.


00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.820
I'm sure there's exceptions,


00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.600
but it seems to be the wise way of doing things.


00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.920
I mean, of course, analytical stuff,


00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.520
maybe you are presenting a report


00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.120
that needs to be hundreds of thousands of lines long,


00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.880
But there aren't many apps that there is a good argument


00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.720
for that, I don't think.


00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:20.640
- Yeah, and so many of these ORMs have a way


00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.400
to limit the returned fields, right?


00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.760
Say I only need the title and the ID,


00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.560
or I need the title, the price, and the ID,


00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.340
'cause I'm gonna do some local data sciencey stuff


00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:32.920
with price or whatever, right?


00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.200
But you don't need the full description


00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.640
and all the user reviews or whatever, right?


00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.720
So that can save a lot.


00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.800
- That's such a good point.


00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.760
And yes, I think I might even see that one more often.


00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.880
So requesting, you know,


00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:48.400
it's effectively the select staff from equivalent.


00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.400
- Yeah, it is, yeah.


00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.800
- You'd be surprised how many different things


00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:57.380
that can affect the number of operations down that tree


00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.420
that can be affected by the number of columns


00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.680
you've requested is huge.


00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:06.480
And it affects things like, oh, by the way,


00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.720
the same goes for how many columns you ask


00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:14.200
it to be sorted or ordered by. So it can make the difference between being able to do, for


00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:22.880
example, an index only scan versus an index scan. And that can be a huge performance difference.


00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:28.640
Just that one alone. In terms of aggregation, it can make a big difference. Yeah, there's


00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:33.740
so many things you'd be kind of the knock on effects of passing that many data. We talked


00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:40.180
about sorts. If you're having to keep that many rows in memory and each one's bigger,


00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:41.700
they're going to use that work memory more quickly.


00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:45.340
Right. It might fall back to one of those write to disk and sort it rather than sort


00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:46.340
it in memory.


00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:47.340
Exactly.


00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:52.460
Interesting. Okay. I hadn't thought about the knock on effects as much. Let's talk a


00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:57.900
little bit about fixing this. We've set up the problem, things you shouldn't do, but


00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:03.480
how do you know whether you're doing them? So you've got a couple of free tools that


00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:07.380
people can use that you might give a shout out to and then let's talk about


00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.780
PG Mustard and maybe talk through some examples there as well.


00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:16.140
Sure, so yeah there's I mean there's so many query plan visualization tools a


00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:22.200
lot of the ideas we discussed also have them inbuilt as well and amazingly all


00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.740
of them a lot of them seem to choose to visualize it quite differently so it's


00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:31.940
quite be quite interesting looking through some of them but this the one


00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:38.060
One you've got up on screen at the moment is a free tool written by a French team, a


00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:41.740
Postgres consultancy called, I don't know how to pronounce it, it's either Dalibo or


00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.700
Dalibo.


00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:50.740
And they, this tool is inspired, I think it's even a fork of a product that was written


00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:54.020
many years ago by a great guy called Alex Tatyants.


00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:59.540
So a lot of people will recognize the Tatyants name from the URL, that was a tool called


00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:00.540
Pev.


00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:05.500
So back in the day when I started the two tools were Depez and Tatyants.


00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:10.220
So Depez being the one you just flicked to briefly there.


00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:12.980
This is like the original, this is the first one.


00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.700
Let's start with the OG first then.


00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:20.220
This guy is a bit of a legend in the Postgres community.


00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.620
He's so helpful on so many of the chat forums.


00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:28.420
And he's a Postgres DBA and has been for many, many years.


00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:36.280
And he built this tool because the text format of Explain, I think he described it as unreadable.


00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:41.600
So he's written a whole great blog series on maybe six parts now on reading Explain


00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:49.000
plans and this tool he's using to highlight in red here kind of big problems or where


00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.160
a lot of the time is going.


00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:54.600
So that's that step four that we talked about, work out where time's going first.


00:54:54.600 --> 00:55:01.680
So if you've seen the explain text, it's kind of indented and talks about the problem and


00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.000
it has things about timing.


00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.760
But here's an HTML table that has columns that shows you the timing and then the number


00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.040
of rows is very important.


00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.560
And then it has, again, still the actual text.


00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.920
And it sounds to me like you think this is pretty important to still have the text that


00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.680
people expect.


00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.840
I think that text is super important for experts and people that have been doing Postgres performance


00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.160
work for years.


00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.520
So they can fall back to that text.


00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.600
If the left-hand side's not helping them,


00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.400
or in the case we're looking at right now,


00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.720
there's a lot of red,


00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.560
it might be tricky to know where to start.


00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.840
You might fall back to looking


00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.120
at the right-hand side for something.


00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.640
Interestingly, that rows column


00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:45.020
is a row count estimate multiplication.


00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:48.560
So it's how many rows did Postgres expect to get


00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.600
versus how many actually came back.


00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:54.200
And that's super important for the cases we discussed


00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.120
briefly around which join algorithms are gonna choose


00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.640
or multiple other, join order is really important as well.


00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.680
It'll try and filter out as many as possible


00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.640
in the first few joins so that there's less data


00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.400
to worry about in the future ones.


00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.640
So if it's really far out in an estimate somewhere,


00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.200
that's really important.


00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.760
So yeah, this tool's doing some of those things


00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.240
and doing it really neatly.


00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.940
but that text format I think is super expert friendly.


00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:24.700
People that are very used to the Postgres text format,


00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:28.980
this is probably the tool they're gonna like best.


00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:31.140
- Yeah, yeah, it's really nice.


00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:34.980
Okay, and then there's the Dalibo,


00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.740
other one that's similar, right?


00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:42.180
- Yes, so this one's the one that's based on PEV.


00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:43.540
So they call it PEV2, I think,


00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.980
and it's open source GitHub repos PEV2.


00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:49.740
And this is their hosted tool.


00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.300
Again, free to use, open source.


00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:56.540
And like the other one, this supports both text format


00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.420
explains and JSON format explains.


00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:00.340
So I think that, yeah, that's what they're saying


00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:02.100
up at the top there.


00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.260
This is much more visual as a tool.


00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:06.660
So this displays the query patterns.


00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.100
- Sadly, they don't have an example I can just pull up.


00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.740
I'd have to like put it all together


00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:11.580
and drop it in there.


00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:12.420
Or do they?


00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:13.500
I didn't see one when I clicked on that.


00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:16.220
- No, it's at the bottom, they might have sample plans.


00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:17.060
There you go.


00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:21.720
So the gray button on the right.


00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.720
- Oh yeah, yeah, okay, you're right.


00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.420
Okay, let's just go with that one.


00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:27.520
Cool, and then I'll submit it.


00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.800
Yeah, how did it, oh, well, it's gray.


00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:29.640
That's why I missed it.


00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.720
Okay, yeah, this looks fantastic.


00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:34.360
- Yeah, so this is a visualization,


00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.160
very similar color scheme to the last one.


00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.520
So you'll see things in red


00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:40.640
that they're saying are really bad,


00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.180
orange if they're medium bad,


00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:45.640
and then yellow if there may be a problem.


00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.640
Yeah, exactly.


00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:50.880
Don't worry about it for now, get back to it later.


00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:57.640
And then, so this is good for visual stuff if you're that way inclined.


00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:04.080
The other thing, some people that are still extremely competent at this love the left


00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.460
hand side especially.


00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:15.600
So it looks unassuming but those little bars are kind of like a flame chart on its side


00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.140
And they'll show you, in this case,


00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:20.220
we're looking at the amount of time spent by each operation,


00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:23.220
but you might be able to take buffers there


00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.180
is a really popular way of looking at it.


00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:31.620
That's a feature that's not in a lot of the other tools.


00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:35.200
So that's a common reason that people really like this tool.


00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.420
- Fantastic.


00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.620
Okay, so these are both totally free, web hosted,


00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:41.860
sounds like some of them are open source.


00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.060
You can probably download them as well.


00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:45.580
They look nice.


00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:48.780
Let's talk PG Mustard a little bit.


00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.780
So like I said, when I came across this,


00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:54.980
I thought, "Wow, this is really a lot nicer


00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:57.280
than the other tools that I've seen for doing this."


00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:01.280
And maybe the best way to understand it would be to talk about two things real quick.


00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.280
You can tell me how you want to talk about it.


00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:07.280
But I think maybe talk about the performance advice.


00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.280
What do you think about that? We could maybe go through that real quick.


00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.280
Some of the things that are in mind for you.


00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:20.360
Well yes, I know there's a lot listed there, but the short version is that we're also trying


00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:24.600
to, we've got some strong opinions on the visual side of things, you know, the red gate


00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:27.880
trying to keep things as simple as possible has not left.


00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:34.280
So my co-founder of this is a guy called Dave, and we worked together for a couple of years


00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.080
almost full time building this.


00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:40.320
So we've also spent a lot more time than some of the others on building this.


00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:46.920
There's a different level of polish and attention to detail if something is your job and the


00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:51.360
maker or breaker of your success versus something you work on in your spare time because it'll


00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.360
help a little, right?


00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.040
Like there just is.


00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.280
Yeah, well, absolutely.


00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:02.760
And hopefully that shows but also the others have done an amazing job and there's surprisingly


01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.080
few differences if you consider how much time difference there is.


01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:11.160
But yeah, so the big differences are on the visualization front, we try and keep things


01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.160
that bit simpler.


01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.160
We're also a lot more opinionated.


01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.980
We assume you are trying to speed up your query.


01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:21.360
And that might sound stupid, but it's not the only reason you would look at a query


01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.360
plan.


01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:27.940
So there are reasons why that we might not be a good fit for people.


01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.840
Let's say you're working on the Postgres source code and you're trying to implement a new


01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.980
feature and you just want to look at some explain plans.


01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.700
You probably want the text format and you probably really want the costs.


01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:43.900
So the things that the plan is using to choose between plans, you probably want those highlighted


01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.220
and we don't highlight those.


01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:49.280
We hide those really far away from you because most of the time when you're trying to speed


01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:54.980
up a query, that's not what you're going to be wanting to see.


01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:55.980
So yeah, so it's super.


01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:56.980
Yeah.


01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:01.660
So which ones of these really do you feel like are both highly valuable, highly recommended


01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:05.020
Or maybe some that are like, wow, I can't believe it would find that I would have never found that


01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:10.380
Good question. Sadly, the most valuable are the index related ones


01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:17.340
So as you mentioned that we call it we call it high index potential when there's a lot of rows being filtered


01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.660
Versus the amount being scanned


01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:20.060
um


01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:26.220
So that's the big thing to look out for in the text format is when there's high numbers of rows being built not just on


01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:32.140
sequential scans, but also if you've got an index scan that's still having to filter out a lot of rows


01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:37.820
that we call that an inefficient index. But it's only inefficient for that query. It's


01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:42.220
there's nothing wrong with the index. It's more that your query doesn't suit that. It's just


01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:47.740
Postgres. That's the best one Postgres could use. Right, right. So yeah, the indexing one's super


01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:51.500
valuable. Operations on disk we've already discussed a few times that comes up a lot and


01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.860
and poor row estimates.


01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.840
These are the most common.


01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.660
All of the others are either rarer


01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.380
or less valuable when you hit them.


01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.580
But sometimes when they're rare,


01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.540
they can be extremely helpful.


01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.260
- Sure, well, once you pass the advice


01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.660
of look for table scans and then add an index


01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:13.660
and don't select star if you got a big result set


01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:14.860
so it doesn't go to disk.


01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:18.580
Those are pretty, not super easy,


01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.200
but those are somewhat easy.


01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:25.240
If it's not fast enough, you're like, well, now what?


01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.240
I added an index.


01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.240
It's not fast enough.


01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.240
Now what?


01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.240
Yeah.


01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.680
One more that I'd love to discuss actually is something we talked about really early


01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.600
on is the idea of trying to do less work.


01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.180
So either not doing the work.


01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:42.620
So what I think something I'm quite proud of is that we'll try and not highlight anything


01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.920
if it's pretty optimal already.


01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.880
Now that's if your query is pretty optimal already and doing a lot of work and still


01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.840
not fast enough for what you want, you kind of need to rethink. You either need to think,


01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.200
should we estimate this number? Do we need to materialize it and run it once every few


01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:05.840
minutes and have every user look at kind of a cached version of it? So that's quite powerful.


01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.200
And then the other side of it, if it's not efficient, it might be a sign of something


01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:19.640
else going wrong. So in Postgres, one of the things that it gets beaten with is effectively


01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:26.180
its equivalent of garbage collection. So the way it does multi-version concurrency control,


01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:32.120
it ends up bloating the tables and the indexes a little bit, sometimes a lot, which is a


01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:38.880
problem. It has automatic systems that people sometimes disable around that. But it also,


01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:44.300
old versions especially, indexes on heavily updated tables for example can quite quickly


01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.580
and easily bloat.


01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:51.820
So pointing out, so if you include the buffers flag we talked about, you can spot when Postgres


01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:56.060
is doing a lot of reads versus the amount of data it's returning and that's sometimes


01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:03.380
a sign that for example an index has got really badly bloated and rebuilding that index, ideally


01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:08.260
concurrently if you're on production, but yeah rebuilding that index.


01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:09.260
This is how you fix it, Michael.


01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.820
What you do is you put that little banner up there and you say we're going to be down


01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:14.380
for four hours on Sunday.


01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:19.040
So if you just don't mind, don't use our website on Sundays because that's when we rebuild


01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.040
the index.


01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.740
Those are often on the same site that have the really bad queries when they're not offline.


01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.340
Anyway, yeah.


01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:30.340
So we're trying to help them and trying to educate and trying to teach them how to avoid


01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.340
those things.


01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.780
But yeah, I know exactly what you mean.


01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.780
So yeah, those are the kinds.


01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.780
Yeah, that's good.


01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:40.940
Yeah, and that I think the more I talk to people that really know this topic and they've spent 20-30 years on it


01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.480
they focus mostly on work done and


01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.820
Really trying to minimize and reduce that as much as possible


01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:52.860
Less is more and all of that. So yeah. Yeah. Okay


01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.480
So let's maybe highlight this through a couple of examples


01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:01.820
I also have one maybe final tool to suggest you have a couple of examples that show how you can


01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:08.060
Check this out over at app.pgmuster.com.


01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:11.520
It will give you the visualization that you can dive into


01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.100
and then the recommendations, right?


01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.740
- Yeah, so this is just an example we've published.


01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.080
Maybe not the best example ever, but it's one that I like.


01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:20.920
- Sure.


01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.540
All right, well, maybe let's just talk


01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:24.540
through the three examples here.


01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.740
Maybe really quickly, the UI.


01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:28.700
So you've got these nodes that are connected,


01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.680
sort of graph theory-like,


01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:42.360
And you can expand and collapse the sections to get details about very much the indented way of the explain text, right?


01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.440
Yes, so we're trying to mimic the text format with that.


01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:50.760
So people that are used to text format, this is the exact same structure but with less data.


01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:58.360
We're doing some of the calculations there, so those 200,000 that you see there, that's the number of rows being returned at each stage.


01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:05.160
And one thing you saw was that those two of those operations were hidden by default at the beginning when you first loaded it.


01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:11.160
That's one of the opinionated things we're doing. By default we'll hide subtrees that are really fast already.


01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.960
So you can, in this example, it's not great, you know, there's only four nodes.


01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:22.520
But you can get queries that have hundreds of nodes, and even ones that return quickly.


01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:27.520
So hiding far sub trees is a very opinionated thing to do,


01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.720
but I find very valuable.


01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.720
- Sure, I like it.


01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.520
And it's about find, you know,


01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.840
bring your attention to the part


01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.880
where you can make improvements.


01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.320
- Yeah, exactly. - Where the time is being spent.


01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.160
Yeah.


01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.640
- So yeah, so that's what we're doing.


01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.680
At the top there, we have a timing bar,


01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.680
which is a bit like a flame graph, but viewed from the top.


01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.200
So kind of like a bird's eye view on that.


01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.440
Maybe this one's got a little better breakdown.


01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.280
- Definitely.


01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.640
So you can see the width of those


01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.040
is the amount of time spent


01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.200
and they're ordered by slowest to fastest.


01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.240
So the idea is to quickly show you


01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.600
if there's one dominant issue


01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:06.560
versus maybe quite a few


01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.000
that are taking a similar amount of time.


01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.320
- Sure, so for people listening,


01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.320
there's this tree of nodes that you can explore


01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.540
to see what's happening,


01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.500
like a gather merge or sort and so on.


01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:22.060
and there's the timing and the likelihood


01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.500
of good recommendations.


01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.140
They all have numbers and then across the top,


01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:28.100
you can see, well, number one was the worst offender


01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:31.660
of performance and then number zero and then number two.


01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.820
- Yeah, I've just realized how un-podcast friendly


01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:35.700
this might be.


01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.340
So apologies to people listening.


01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:39.580
- Well, you know, I'm gonna link to these examples


01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.500
and people can go check them out.


01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.740
- Yeah, well, yeah, thank you.


01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:44.700
And then, so the last thing that we're doing,


01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.060
so the other tools do that quite well, in my opinion,


01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.900
in terms of showing you where the time's going.


01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.660
I prefer a very visual way of seeing that,


01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.820
and that's similar to the Dalibor one we looked at.


01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:57.020
You can see quite quickly where those time bars are going.


01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:00.420
The thing we do additionally is these scored tips.


01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:05.420
So we're trying to look for every issue we know about,


01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:06.260
and we're trying to look at them


01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:08.260
on every single operation we see,


01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.440
and then we're calculating roughly how much time


01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.660
we think you could save if you fix the problem


01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.260
that we think might be there,


01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:16.640
and then scoring that so that we only show you


01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:21.360
the top three, maximum three, in this case, just one.


01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:27.480
So even in this case, you can see that most of the time is being spent doing 200,000 loops


01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.940
of an index only scan.


01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:33.720
So something that's probably extremely fast on its own, but the fact we're doing 200,000


01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.240
loops of it adds up quite quickly.


01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.880
Yeah, exactly.


01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.560
And the real problem is a bad row estimate.


01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.400
So in fact, it's the exact example we were discussing earlier.


01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:52.720
picked a nested loop because it's not expecting to have to do that many loops.


01:08:52.720 --> 01:09:00.200
But in reality there were nearly 200 times more rows than it was expecting and that was


01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.520
probably a bad choice of join algorithm.


01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.080
Right, okay.


01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:09.880
Yeah, so if I click on, if you just open it up, right on the left it says top tips 4.6


01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.200
out of five likelihood of improvement,


01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:16.280
operation zero, row estimate out by a factor of 191.8.


01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.280
Then I can click on the details here.


01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.040
If I click on the node that it pulls up,


01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.200
it says that same thing, you can expand it out


01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:29.200
and it gives you a nice human English language description


01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.240
of that and then the operations,


01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:35.560
the nested loop it describes like what that is,


01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.200
gives you some stats on the buffers


01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.000
and then the operational details


01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.120
like it was an inner join and how long it took and so on.


01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.280
- Yeah, absolutely.


01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.160
And actually, it's a really good point


01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.440
on the operation descriptions.


01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.520
I also spent ages, probably a couple of months solid,


01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:55.280
making documentation page or a glossary of terms


01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.040
that you can come across in WordPress.


01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.440
- Writing a manual, but in like two paragraphs at a time


01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.880
to be delivered.


01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.760
- Yeah, so we put a lot of them in the product,


01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.440
but we've also put them online for people


01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.680
so they can freely access them as well.


01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:14.280
sort of yeah those are all available on glossary on our website as well.


01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:20.520
Yeah okay so in this example what do I do like it tells me these things what is what


01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:24.040
should I go do to make this better is there anything I can't?


01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.880
Well exactly I mean here's what we're looking at.


01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:35.560
Vow estimates are tricky but Postgres has a thing called analyze where it will gather


01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:43.440
statistics on each table, it will take a sample of them, it will look for most common values,


01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:49.720
so it can kind of estimate joins accurately, that kind of thing. And it might be that analyze


01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.160
hasn't run in a long time for whatever reason.


01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.440
I see the data has dramatically changed since it last took stats. So it's using out of date


01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.160
stats to make its decisions.


01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:04.440
Exactly. A really common cause of that is if you do a major version upgrade in Postgres,


01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.880
doesn't bring along your statistics so you do need to run and analyze as part of your


01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:13.400
upgrade so that's really important.


01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:18.320
But then if you, there's a learn more link here as well with, it will go into quite a


01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:23.320
few more things you can do so if it's not analyzed there's a bunch of other ways you


01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:29.320
can teach Postgres or ask Postgres to gather more statistics so if it's a heavily skewed


01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:36.080
column. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so we've gone into quite a lot of detail in that blog post.


01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.560
But yeah, there's a bunch. I love it, though. Because if I if somebody told me this, I'm


01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:46.840
like, well, I don't really know what to do. To be clear, I'm basically a beginner on Postgres,


01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.880
but not on relational databases, especially not on databases in general. Right. So I might


01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.080
look at this go up. Great. But does Postgres even have a way to fix this? Right. And then


01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.160
you're right here next to it. You're like, OK, you just run this command and you'll probably


01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.160
And I think that's super valuable,


01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.160
because it's one thing to say, "Here's your problem,"


01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.160
or, "This is where the problem resides."


01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.160
It's another, like, "Now what?"


01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.160
- Yeah, and these days, engineers and developers


01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.160
are expected to know, well, there's so many people


01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.160
that started back-end, and then they kind of went full stack,


01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.160
but then they have to worry about the database as well.


01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.160
And it feels like the surface area is expanding


01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160
in a lot of cases.


01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:26.160
So we meet a lot of extremely smart developers


01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:31.320
developers that have been doing back-end work for decades that only have to deal


01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.120
with Postgres every few months or maybe even every couple of years.


01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.560
Those people, we kind of want to help them because they know what


01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.160
they're doing, it's just this information is not top of mind right now.


01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:48.240
So that tends to be who we can help most easily and we're trying to


01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.160
make it a bit more beginner-friendly as well.


01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.160
Yeah, that's fantastic.


01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:55.160
Okay, so that's example one, which I'll link to.


01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:03.160
Example two, we've got a more significant challenge here, more stuff happening.


01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.160
This one we're throwing away too many rows.


01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:12.160
Yeah, so well this is a great example actually of a tip I didn't mention, but it's probably index related.


01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:22.160
So we're throwing away rows at the end here, going down from 45,000 in the second to last operation, down to 100 in the last one.


01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:30.200
last one, if we could filter down to ideally a much smaller number very early on, we could


01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:36.720
avoid, there's a couple of large sequential scans there, a couple of hash joins, all on


01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.640
tens of thousands of rows of data.


01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:45.920
In this case, there's no big filter until the end, so we're not giving an index potential


01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:51.920
tip, but we're saying if you can, yeah, so in fact, we'll actually see on the sequential


01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:56.000
scans we're saying index potential is zero.


01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.600
Because no rows are being filtered there.


01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:07.840
But the late filter at the end, the rows discarded, is depending on exactly how it's discarding


01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:13.780
those and what it's doing, I think I remember from this example, we're actually sorting


01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:24.340
by columns in two different tables. So we're ordering by a column from one and then ordering


01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:30.800
by a column from the other and neither of those columns is indexed. So if we could get


01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.660
the data from each of those in an ordered manner, this would probably be a lot faster.


01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:40.380
But it's a tricky investigation because we don't know from what Postgres is telling us


01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:45.720
here exactly how those are distributed and how many of them are going to be appropriate


01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:46.720
at each stage.


01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.720
Yeah.


01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.160
Another thing I find value is not necessarily the advice, but the non-advice.


01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.380
Like you know what, there's zero index potential here.


01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:56.700
This is fine.


01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.660
So don't look down that path.


01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:00.660
Go look somewhere else.


01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:01.660
Right?


01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:02.660
Row estimates, perfect.


01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:03.660
Operation happened in memory.


01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:04.960
Don't worry about those things.


01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.780
Go find the problem somewhere else.


01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.520
Yeah, exactly.


01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.800
That was actually user feedback quite early on.


01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.520
People wanted to see the things that were not an issue.


01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:22.080
So it's been really helpful working with people and trying to understand what they do and


01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.080
don't find.


01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:27.520
It wasn't something I thought of, but through feedback, it was really helpful to know that


01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.520
is exactly what people want to see.


01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520
Yeah.


01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:35.600
I mean, I think this is super valuable.


01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.560
So people want to check out PG Mustard.


01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.680
It's worth pointing out that it does cost money, right?


01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.880
It is a product.


01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.280
- Yeah, sorry, for our sins, it's commercial.


01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.720
But if anybody's, if there are students listening,


01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.680
for non-commercial use, we give it away to people.


01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.620
All you need to do is just contact us.


01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:57.480
And yeah, there's a couple of other reasons


01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.000
we give it away for free.


01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.840
So yeah, feel free to reach out.


01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.080
But we hope it's not too expensive as well,


01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.520
especially if you're doing this for work.


01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.940
Yeah, it starts at 95 euros per year for a single person.


01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:12.860
So hopefully affordable.


01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.580
- Yeah, and I think it's,


01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:17.020
I don't mean to make that derogatory, not at all.


01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.060
I just wanted people to know,


01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.980
like the other ones we talked about were free


01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:22.100
and open source and this one, it is a product,


01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.060
you do pay for it.


01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:28.820
But boy, if you could save a database upgrade


01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:31.220
to a new machine, or if you could save,


01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:35.180
you know, spending $100 a month on a larger server


01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:39.820
in the cloud every month because this thing help you find


01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:40.820
that, oh, you actually don't need it.


01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.580
You're just doing it wrong, right?


01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:46.740
Well, $100 once seems like a pretty good bargain, you know?


01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.660
- Yeah, absolutely.


01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.740
And I mean, not even talking about PG Mustard,


01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:51.700
but tools in general,


01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.900
I think developers probably underestimate


01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.380
how valuable their time is,


01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:58.500
not just from a salary per hour perspective,


01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.100
but also from a, if your management team


01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:04.180
or your boss or whoever could choose


01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:08.460
whether you would ship the next year's worth of features today,


01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:11.340
and they could pay, let's say, 10 times your salary,


01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:13.940
a lot of them would actually take that trade.


01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.660
I think every company in the world is hiring developers.


01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:20.220
Most people have a huge backlog that they want to be building.


01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:26.460
So this is an awful example in terms of spending money to solve that,


01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.060
but even if it comes to more expensive tools,


01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.420
I think you'd be surprised how much,


01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:33.860
if they can make you more efficient,


01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:37.580
companies will probably think of it as a better trade than you do.


01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:43.780
Yeah, I agree. I do think that we often muddle along using


01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:47.060
something that we should be better off paying a decent


01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:50.060
amount. I'm talking about like $2,000 a month subscriptions of


01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:54.980
some insane tool that may or may not be helpful. But also, just


01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:59.020
from a joy, you're like, do you want to go to work and work on


01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:02.260
stuff? Or are you like, God, I'm in the log files again. I just,


01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.660
I can't do it, I can't do another day of this, right?


01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.580
Versus, oh, like I really have a good understanding


01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:10.020
I'm building something that I'm proud to share with my friends


01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:11.860
look how fast and zippy this site is


01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:15.100
versus, yeah, we're working on it, you know?


01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:18.340
Like there is a pride and a joy aspect of being better


01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:21.020
and if tools get you there, that's great.


01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:23.700
All right, speaking of tools,


01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.420
I think we're about out of time for this


01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:27.920
but final two questions before we get out of here.


01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:35.140
I think I want to focus on database GUI editors


01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:37.180
rather than text editors for this episode.


01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.660
And we talked about a bunch.


01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:41.900
So maybe we could just quick reference back to that.


01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:46.300
But favorite database GUI tool these days?


01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.820
- Oh, I'm going to give it a shot.


01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:52.300
- Do you want to go with PSQL?


01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.860
- No, I'm going to risk the wrath of the Postgres crowd


01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:57.060
and say Archetype.


01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:57.460
- Archetype.


01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:00.660
All right, yeah, Archetype looks pretty neat.


01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:05.620
And then, normally I ask about Python extensions,


01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:07.660
how about Postgres, or Python packages,


01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.980
how about Postgres extensions for a notable one?


01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:15.220
- Yeah, so I think the Postgres extension


01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.020
that everybody should install really,


01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:20.280
if you're using Postgres of course, is pgstatstatements.


01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.420
If you're using a cloud provider,


01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.880
it's probably on by default already.


01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.440
So in that case, I'd give a shout out


01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.740
to my favorite, autoexplain.


01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.020
- Cool, awesome.


01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:34.060
All right, Michael, well, thanks for giving us insight


01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.120
to all these different things we can do


01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.820
to make our databases work better, especially Postgres.


01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.700
And thanks for making PG Mustard.


01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:42.340
I'm sure it'll help a lot of people.


01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:43.180
Final call to action,


01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:45.580
people wanna get better with their databases.


01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.420
Maybe pick up some of these tools or these ideas.


01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:48.500
What do you tell them?


01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:52.940
- Ooh, don't be scared to learn.


01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:56.020
It probably looks more intimidating than it is.


01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:58.000
The Postgres documentation's awesome,


01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.720
so a lot of the other databases out there.


01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.920
I know it's a bit of a meme and a joke these days,


01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.520
but do read the documentation.


01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.800
It's written, it's been written and revised over years


01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.160
by some really smart people,


01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.800
but it's very approachable still.


01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.480
- Fantastic, all right.


01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.320
Well, thanks a bunch.
