00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
- Yeah, for sure.


00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.680
- Yeah, for sure.


00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.880
So, I mean, I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.


00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.280
So hopefully you're looking forward to it as well.


00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.680
- Yeah, for sure.


00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.520
- Yeah, for sure.


00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.720
So, I mean, I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.


00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.960
So, I'm excited to talk about ML Ops


00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.600
and your community and some best practices


00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840
and tooling and all that kind of stuff.


00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.080
And I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.


00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.680
So hopefully you're looking forward to it as well.


00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.760
I mean, think about one of the hottest areas of technology


00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.720
right now, whether it's trying to get a job,


00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.960
or it's VC funding, or whatever, right?


00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.000
The machine learning and AI is like one of the peak buzzwords


00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.720
right now.


00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.480
And so I think this is going to be a fun conversation,


00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.200
both to talk about this hot topic,


00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.440
but also maybe to demystify it a little bit.


00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.480
Yeah.


00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.980
Yeah.


00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.680
I hope we can do that.


00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.560
I think we can.


00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.640
I definitely think we can.


00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.160
You all built this cool community, mlops.community,


00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.600
which we're gonna talk about a lot,


00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.040
but before we get into that topic,


00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.040
let's just start with your background


00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.600
and how you got into machine learning and all this stuff.


00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.960
Kate, let's start with you.


00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.360
- All right, so my background's probably


00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.200
not so conventional for the field,


00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.680
although nothing is conventional for ML,


00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.240
I guess, at this point.


00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.680
So originally, I actually started studying business


00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.280
and economics back in the day,


00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.920
And then I slowly shifted into basically digital analytics for marketing and stuff like that.


00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.280
At which point I realized that I'm more interested in the numbers than in influencing people.


00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.120
So I went through a boot camp and then one thing led to another through consulting, internships and so forth.


00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.960
Once you get your foot in the door, I guess it's easier to establish yourself.


00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.800
And then I ended up continuing on that path, mostly data science.


00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.800
So not crazy robots or anything.


00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.160
- No self-driving cars right now.


00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.040
- Don't sell their cars yet.


00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.040
So it's still mostly basically ML for commercial purposes.


00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.760
So like working with sales data,


00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.040
with text data and so forth.


00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.880
- Cool.


00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.840
- That was it.


00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.720
- Yeah, fantastic.


00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.560
I think there's a lot of people that come from economics


00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.560
in that area and get into sort of get into computation


00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.280
and then get into data science.


00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.200
It's a bit of a gateway, I think.


00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.080
- Yeah, and I mean, economics is also kind of


00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.640
this easy choice of subject when you're finishing school.


00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.440
You're kind of like, "Hmm, I can do math,


00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.000
"so I'm not gonna do just social science."


00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.560
It's okay, let's go for economics.


00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.080
And then you're like, "Hmm, what can I actually do with it?"


00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.200
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.


00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.760
I had a similar experience with my math degree, but.


00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.720
Yeah, fantastic.


00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.880
So you said you did a bootcamp, which I think is interesting.


00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.600
When I think bootcamps, I think JavaScript front end, not necessarily the best thing


00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.120
to just produce a whole world full of JavaScript front end folks.


00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.280
But that's sort of the main bootcamp story.


00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.800
It sounds like yours was in data science.


00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800
Was that a good experience?


00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.640
What was that like?


00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.920
So we actually did have those paths as well with Java and front end.


00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.560
I just decided to go for the data science one.


00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.360
I think they even called it big data in AI or something like that.


00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.440
But technically it was just like pure, nice Jupyter notebooks where you are massaging


00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.040
the data a little bit and then running your first couple of models.


00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.320
It was very nice in a sense that it was like all of us struggling together was very intense.


00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.720
So you kind of can test drive your idea of whether it's actually for you or not in a


00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.720
very short time.


00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.800
And ours lasted like, I think three or four weeks.


00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.920
And after that internship, the same company, sorry, Bootcamp, would get you into an internship.


00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.320
If you pass the whole Bootcamp, you pass the last test, do the project, and then do the


00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.100
interview, you can be a candidate there.


00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.960
And I think that was very appealing to me because it had some consequence.


00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.880
It wasn't just, oh, let's try this out, and then I don't know what I'm going to do, who's


00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.840
going to hire me, whatever.


00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.240
It was very well thought out.


00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.440
So in that sense, I think it's a great program that they have put together.


00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.760
I think they're not doing it anymore, like specifically for data scientists, because


00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.480
they found out it's very hard even in consulting to employ very, very junior data scientists


00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.260
and get value out of them.


00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.600
So now they're training people in data engineering and then a little flavor of data science so


00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.680
that later you can develop the skill and maybe apply that knowledge down the road.


00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.640
- Yeah, interesting.


00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.460
I do think it probably is a little bit challenging


00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.520
to get in as a junior,


00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.760
because there's not a huge team of data scientists


00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.120
a lot of times, so interesting.


00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.360
Demetrius, how about you?


00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.520
- Yeah, so I fell into this very, very happenstance,


00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.840
in a happenstance kind of way,


00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.360
which was I was working on the sales side


00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.720
of a company that was selling tools


00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.360
to machine learning engineers,


00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.360
and so I was that guy that would spam people


00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.960
And so if I spammed you, please forgive me back in the day.


00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.880
If I tried to reach out to you on LinkedIn


00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.200
and I tricked you into connecting with me,


00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.140
that was my past life.


00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.880
I have repented for my sins


00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.880
and now I do the community stuff full on.


00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.360
But yeah, the company was doing ML tooling


00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.520
and we were really focused on provenance


00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.300
and trying to be able to reproduce your runs


00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.180
or your data, your models,


00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.420
everything that comes along with the modeling side


00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.260
of machine learning.


00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.740
And so what happened was though,


00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.260
when the pandemic hit, that company went out of business


00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.700
and just about like three weeks


00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.220
before the company went out of business,


00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.620
nobody was picking up the phone,


00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.580
nobody was connecting with me on LinkedIn.


00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.220
And so our CEO said,


00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.840
"Why don't we try and do something around a community?"


00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.200
And we basically--


00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.720
- So people don't want us to come to them,


00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.260
maybe we can make a place for them to come to, right?


00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.900
- Exactly, and so our CEO, I gotta hand it to him,


00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.360
his name's Luke Marsden, back in those days,


00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.800
and he was the CEO of this company called DotScience,


00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.080
which is now defunct, he said,


00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.000
"You know what, he has open source in his blood.


00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.240
"He can't help but do the open source thing."


00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.040
Even though this company wasn't open source,


00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.120
He wanted the community to be very open source


00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.800
and vendor neutral and open to anyone.


00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.320
And in the beginning, I didn't understand that.


00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.160
I was like, wait a minute,


00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160
you're gonna let our competitors come in here?


00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.360
And not only that, you're gonna let them give a talk?


00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.080
No way, man, this is crazy.


00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.520
And so he was all about it.


00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.480
And he helped me to understand the value of community


00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.960
and what it's about.


00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.440
And then because of that, those first weeks,


00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.400
I just was interviewing people


00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.140
as a podcast host because I needed to ramp up.


00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.360
And so I was interviewing people,


00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.280
basically I was learning on the air.


00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.360
And I was talking to different machine learning engineers


00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.560
when we would have the meetups


00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.040
and we would run it like a,


00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.420
like almost like a podcast slash meetup.


00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.940
And it would be live podcast,


00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.620
kind of not too dissimilar to what we are doing right now.


00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.700
And then I was able to talk to enough people


00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.720
and then more people started joining the community


00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.460
and then I started learning more about it.


00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.980
And now here we are, like two years later,


00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.980
and I'm still running with the community.


00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.780
It became something that is like my pride and joy.


00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.980
And I can't see, it's part of my identity now,


00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.620
which I don't know if that's a good or bad thing,


00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.380
but it's part of it.


00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.180
- It sounds really fun.


00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.500
And these communities are super fun to build.


00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.140
And two years, that's a long time to be building.


00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.380
And so it's the kind of stuff


00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.060
that doesn't necessarily explode overnight,


00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.100
but if you sort of take the long view


00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.740
and then look back, you're like, wow, look what we built.


00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.540
That's pretty neat.


00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.380
- Yeah, totally.


00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.500
I mean, and Vishnu was in it at the very beginning


00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.460
and Vishnu and I talked quite a bit.


00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.420
And it was like, when there was,


00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.900
I remember in the first couple months,


00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.740
I was sitting there and thinking,


00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.500
wow, if we hit 600 people in Slack,


00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.500
that will be like, uncomprehendable.


00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.700
And so, yeah, then it's kind of, like you said,


00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.920
it's just grown from there and you look back and you go,


00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.200
How did we get here?


00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.040
Wow, this is incredible.


00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.960
- Yeah, I think one of the things


00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.040
that's easy to lose sight of for creators


00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.580
and community members or organizers and stuff,


00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.600
it's really easy to get tied up.


00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.000
You look at like a famous YouTube person


00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.840
with a million views on their videos,


00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.840
or you look at some crazy TikTok thing or something,


00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.840
but 600 people, that's pretty close to a keynote


00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.620
for a lot of conference.


00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.160
That's like the premier group where you try to get them all together.


00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.180
Like that's pretty, pretty amazing.


00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.780
So and I know it's grown from there, which is awesome.


00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.780
Yeah.


00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.340
Vishnu, how about you?


00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:17.420
Well how I got started in ML, I think if I really had to trace it back, it was maybe


00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:25.360
around 2017, you know, around that time I was really kind of thinking about what I should


00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.360
try and do in my career.


00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.320
I was really passionate about, I am, continue to be very passionate about healthcare and


00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.760
biotech and sort of life sciences field.


00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.160
And I was reading a lot and kind of thinking, "What do I want to do with my career?"


00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.280
It was maybe kind of similar to Demetrius, actually contemplating some of the more sales


00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.040
or business development or product management side of things in the industry.


00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.160
But I was like, "It doesn't feel tangible enough.


00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:56.000
It doesn't feel like I'm actually helping make people healthier in a very hands-on way."


00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.040
And so I started to read more papers as part of a master's program on the impact of machine


00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.800
learning in health, healthcare, and biotechnology, and decided, "Okay, this is what I want to


00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.800
do."


00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:12.000
And just spent some time teaching myself how these things work, took some courses, became


00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.360
a machine learning engineer in a medical device company.


00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:20.200
And quickly after starting that, realized, "Well, there's a lot more to machine learning


00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.060
than just doing model.fit."


00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.140
And that's when I joined the MLOps community back when it was about 300 people in May of


00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.140
2020.


00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.580
And, you know, I've been in it since.


00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.220
Dimitris and I are pretty, pretty tied to that.


00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.820
And that's kind of tracked my growth as a machine learning engineer in terms of understanding,


00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:41.500
you know, okay, how do we go from model to model and production to system to, you know,


00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.260
business value.


00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.940
And that's kind of been my journey in terms of this industry to date.


00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.940
Yeah.


00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.980
Super neat.


00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:56.820
I think around 2017 was certainly when the promise of machine learning for healthcare


00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.300
really started to gain public awareness.


00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:05.140
You had like, I don't remember exactly the timing, but like that X-Prize around mammography


00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.260
images and stuff like that, where like, this is starting to beat doctors, right?


00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And it's automatic.


00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:18.540
Like could it be both fast and sort of beating radiologists' estimates of whether or not


00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.180
someone has cancer and things like that.


00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.140
And that's, that was, that's pretty neat.


00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.780
And I'm sure I haven't been tracking it that closely,


00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.060
those sorts of developments,


00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.500
but I'm sure it's just grown from there.


00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.620
- Yeah, I mean, I think around that time you had,


00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.220
it's a good memory with XPRIZE


00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.420
that was on sort of available.


00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.500
There was also a chest X-ray work that was open source


00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.980
from the NIH, big data sets around, you know,


00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.180
what's the, what is the promise of machine learning modeling


00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.460
for that problem, diagnosing pneumonia,


00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.020
And then also AlphaFold came out around that time


00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.700
from DeepMind for biotech and protein engineering.


00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.660
And so on all sorts of different vectors,


00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.660
you had a lot of energy.


00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.220
And I guess I was sucked in by that.


00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.060
- Yeah, that's cool.


00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.380
I suspect that the protein folding understanding


00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.580
is even more important really than you have this problem,


00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.340
but like here we can understand how to fix it maybe.


00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.180
For sure.


00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.460
- Yeah, I think the protein folding stuff,


00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.020
it's especially with the open sourcing of AlphaFold2,


00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.820
recently the buzz is pretty incredible.


00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.820
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.340
Well, let's start off by talking a bit


00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.700
about the ML Ops community some more,


00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.180
and then we can dive into a couple of layers


00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.620
of best practices and machine learning


00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.000
in production and stuff like that.


00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.060
So maybe Dimitrios, we talked a bit about it,


00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.900
but you wanna introduce what it's all about for folks?


00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.340
- Yeah, and so we're really trying to just be,


00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.900
- Yeah, this landing page is funny


00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.100
because it's something that we put together


00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.860
whatever years ago and now we definitely need an upgrade


00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.540
and so we're doing that right now


00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.620
because I realized after I surveyed the whole community,


00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.660
a lot of people are like,


00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.100
wow, we're in this community, we're in the Slack,


00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.260
but we didn't realize that there is newsletters


00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.700
you got going on, you've got round table discussions


00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.220
happening, there's reading groups,


00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.740
there's all kinds of different initiatives


00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.780
that people from the community are doing,


00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:22.780
and we don't actually make that very clear


00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.140
for people when they join, right?


00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.260
So maybe they know about the Slack,


00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.620
or maybe they know about the meetups,


00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.180
or the podcasts that we have, but that's it.


00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.420
And they don't necessarily get to go through all of that


00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.460
and have a better overview.


00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:38.780
So that's what we're doing now.


00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.340
And really, like the community for us,


00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.740
it's trying to find this place,


00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.480
We're trying to define and create this space


00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.340
where people can come together, they can learn,


00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.300
they can engage with practitioners who are on the front lines


00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.140
and get their questions answered,


00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.740
but also like meet others and network with people.


00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.740
And we're doing that in this virtual space.


00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.700
We're trying to really share, collaborate, learn,


00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:08.140
and trying to make it fun also.


00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.420
So it's not just like numbers,


00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.240
crunching numbers and stale and boring.


00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.280
- Sure, I'll throw an idea out there.


00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.360
You'll tell me what you think.


00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.080
I already sort of hinted at this,


00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.760
for software developers, a lot of times they're on teams


00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.880
where there's a group of five or 10 of them working together


00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.160
but I feel like that's less true for machine learning folks


00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.680
and more of a specialized role.


00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.040
Not always, I know, and there's teams and stuff


00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.400
but a lot of companies have a data scientist


00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.680
or one or two data scientists.


00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.520
And it seems to me like communities like this


00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.240
would be even more valuable than say,


00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.200
like a software development one,


00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.200
where it's maybe easier to find people in your environment


00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.640
as a meet at a meetup or at a company


00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.400
that you already work at or something like that.


00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.320
- Totally.


00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.160
- Yeah.


00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:58.980
- Totally.


00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.820
Yeah, and it...


00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.280
Go ahead Vishnu.


00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.840
- I resonate with your description there, Michael,


00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.720
because that was me when I found the community, right?


00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.160
You know, I was a machine learning engineer


00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.360
who was putting together some models


00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.760
that I thought could be used better


00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.240
by the company that I was at,


00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.880
could be integrated into our hardware device


00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.520
a little bit better than I thought


00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.840
that then was currently being done.


00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.080
And I was trying to talk to our software engineers


00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.320
and realize like, hey, there's kind of a,


00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.040
just like a translation gap.


00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.120
Like what is this field of like taking a model


00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.720
that exists and has some value in terms of like accuracy


00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.920
and precision or whatever else,


00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.200
and turn that into an artifact


00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.560
that's consumed by software teams


00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.280
and then ultimately by business teams.


00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.520
And I read about ML Ops in 2020,


00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.200
but was really not clear what exactly that meant.


00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.680
It felt more like a buzzword than it did like a field


00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.840
at that time, you know?


00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.920
And I joined the community


00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.520
and it essentially became real-time stack overflow for me,


00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.780
right, where people are asking and answering questions daily


00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.080
about how do you actually implement production ML?


00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.920
What does it look like?


00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.180
What are the best practices?


00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.720
and how can we help each other do that at work


00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.120
and be better ML practitioners day to day.


00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.400
So it's been great from that standpoint.


00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.800
- Yeah, fantastic.


00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.640
Kate, how about you?


00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.360
How'd you come to the community?


00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.280
- I'm not actually sure exactly,


00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.520
but I think it was also like the whole pandemic,


00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.800
you try to connect to the world and including MLOps.


00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.000
And at the time a friend of mine


00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.120
who was also starting a community in Riga,


00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.160
it wasn't MLOps, it was data science in my hometown,


00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.440
because again, we couldn't meet in person.


00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.680
So we did that.


00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.780
And along the same time,


00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.560
we discovered that there are other Slack communities


00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.320
and it was just fun to, we had a different focus.


00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.560
So it was just fun to be kind of part of both


00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.560
and in different directions.


00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.760
And I do agree with the Stack Overflow notion.


00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.000
Like sometimes, especially if you're working alone


00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
on a problem, you just go there to feel like


00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.080
you're not crazy, first of all,


00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.600
think what you're thinking.


00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.280
And secondly, just basically I can search right now.


00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:09.880
is like such a huge knowledge base because so many questions have been asked so I can go there to


00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:16.280
quickly validate some ideas, see which angles have been taken into consideration, so in that sense it


00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:21.800
was fun and definitely the networking aspect. Luckily Berlin is full of ML people and that's


00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.480
definitely one of the places you can reach out for questions. I had some people reach out to me,


00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:33.080
ask about like what are the companies to apply to, are there any jobs, do you want to refer me and


00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.120
and vice versa, so it's definitely fun.


00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.240
- Yeah, nice.


00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.560
I don't know why this is, but you're right.


00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.480
It does seem like Berlin and sort of generally Germany


00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.220
as well, it's just a lot of times I'm talking to people


00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.760
about data science or machine learning,


00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.880
I'm like, wait, you're both in Berlin?


00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.880
No, it's like of all the places in the world,


00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.560
it does seem like a hotbed of machine learning.


00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.520
That's pretty cool.


00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.040
- And now there's a lot of companies


00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.080
that just source their talent here


00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.840
and work in completely different markets


00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.920
because they know that there are people here


00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.400
and the people will be willing to relocate here as well.


00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.880
So that's definitely adding to the whole dynamic.


00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.720
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.540
It's a cool place to live.


00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.400
And I think probably a lot of folks in Germany,


00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.680
I know the education system there,


00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.680
they end up very good and strong backgrounds in math


00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.600
and stuff.


00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.000
So, right, compared to other places in the world,


00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.120
like the US, certainly coming out of high school there,


00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.000
you come out with a very strong math degree,


00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.980
I know that much, so pretty cool.


00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.200
All right, well, let's start by talking about,


00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.920
I wanted to cover sort of the, your overall thoughts


00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.780
on some different layers or stages


00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.480
of a machine learning project,


00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.460
so we could structure our conversation around that.


00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.680
So I wanna talk about prototyping,


00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.880
come up with ideas, choosing frameworks, things like that,


00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.760
and then talk about building the project with development


00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.920
and then running and maintaining it over time,


00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.200
the whole ops sort of machine learning


00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.400
and production side of things.


00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.800
So let's start with prototyping.


00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.120
So I guess the first question I wanted to ask,


00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.520
and this might be, I don't know,


00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.960
you all can laugh at me or whatever,


00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.080
but deciding is a problem actually


00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.360
a machine learning problem?


00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.560
Because there is so much hype around AI


00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.760
and machine learning that sometimes I think


00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.880
a series of if statements.


00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.640
It is called artificial intelligence.


00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.240
I remember there was this scandal,


00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.400
I think it was in the UK,


00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.760
there was some airline company


00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.800
that was specifically finding families traveling together


00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.760
and booking them apart from each other


00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.520
and then charging them money to book themselves back,


00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.320
like a premium so they could sit with their family.


00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.000
Like, sorry, your seat didn't get put next to your family.


00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.920
Whoopsie, but you can pay 50 bucks or 50 quid or whatever


00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.040
and get back by your family, right?


00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.200
And it was in the lawmakers there were like,


00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.880
they're using artificial intelligence to do this terrible,


00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.760
I think that sounds like an if statement.


00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:09.280
So, you know, like I think deciding,


00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.320
should I just encode some decision making into software,


00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.160
which we often call programming,


00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.800
versus is it a real machine learning problem


00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.480
where like, you know, neural networks or NLP,


00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.480
like, how do you all think about


00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.880
this is a machine learning problem


00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.880
versus this is just a software problem, traditional style.


00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.680
- I'll just say one thing just before


00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.900
I let Vishnu and Kate jump in.


00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.720
And it comes from one of the community members, Eugene Yan,


00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.240
who has a famous tweet and blog post


00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.580
about the first rule of machine learning


00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.200
is don't use machine learning.


00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.140
And so if you can avoid it at all costs,


00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.400
it's probably better,


00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.600
just because you're adding additional complexity.


00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.200
And if you don't need to do that,


00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.540
then it's gonna be infinitely easier on you to not.


00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.040
That being said, there are a lot of times


00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.320
where you do need to add it.


00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.920
And there are a lot of businesses


00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.120
that are realizing business value from it.


00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.720
So that's like kind of a hand wavy answer,


00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.640
but I'll see if Vishnu or Kate have anything more.


00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.480
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.360
Also, I just wanna give a quick shout out.


00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.360
I did have Eugene on the podcast back in March of last year


00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.800
and we talked about the seven lessons


00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.720
that machine learning can teach us about life


00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.760
or something like that, which is pretty,


00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.400
he's a very thoughtful guy, it was interesting.


00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.440
- Yeah, he's great.


00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.640
- Yeah. - He's awesome.


00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.480
- Yeah.


00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:44.680
- I mean, your question is about whether or not


00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.400
to use machine learning versus


00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.040
maybe more traditional approaches.


00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.280
- Right, right, someone comes to you with a problem,


00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.720
so we need to make our API do this


00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.200
website do this or our app do that? And how do you decide like, this is a machine learning problem


00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:03.440
versus just, you know, you just need to decide if statement or switch statement or whatever.


00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:10.720
Yeah, I mean, I deal with this problem a lot in my role right now. So I'm a data scientist at a


00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:16.800
healthcare services company, actually the first data hire. And, you know, a lot of times, you


00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.440
know, I have people come to me that says, Hey, this is a clinical population, this is a group


00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.600
group of people that we want to serve, you know,


00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.760
how do you think about delivering our intervention to them?


00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.360
I'm speaking in generalities, but I can,


00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.200
I can talk a little bit more specifically to some examples


00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.300
of this later on.


00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.000
And to me, what matters most is driving value


00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.440
on a single business metric, because to be honest,


00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.840
that's the simplest way that your company does better


00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.120
and you do better, right?


00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.480
It's not through, let's say,


00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.840
implementing the most fancy algorithm, you know,


00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.880
we're not working in research environments anymore


00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.000
when it comes to machine learning as often as we used to.


00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.080
If you're in a research role, be my guest,


00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.120
use the most advanced algorithm


00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.720
or whatever the coolest latest model might be.


00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.360
But for me, the number one thing is


00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.040
what is the business model metric I'm trying to drive?


00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.280
Is that engagement for our population?


00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.480
Is that some sort of like quality metric


00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.880
in the healthcare sense that I'm trying to change?


00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.600
And then what is the simplest possible way


00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.280
that I can advance that number?


00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.340
Is it just like a standard SQL query I run?


00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.140
Is it some kind of template in SQL query


00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.640
or is it a machine learning model?


00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.360
And the idea is simple is reliable and scalable


00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.320
much more so than something complicated.


00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.000
And that's something, that's kind of the way that I triage


00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.540
whether or not machine learning


00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.740
is the right intervention for a problem.


00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.560
So to kind of recap, it's like,


00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.640
what's the business model metric I'm trying to push


00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.560
and then what's the simplest possible thing


00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.640
knowing that it's something that needs to be reliable


00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.920
maintainable for the long term.


00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.920
Yeah, excellent.


00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.920
Kate?


00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.920
I agree with Vishnu.


00:23:52.920 --> 00:24:01.920
Well, my advantage as a newcomer to this career path, I guess, was that I was just unable


00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.000
to go very fancy in many of the cases.


00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.720
So it was a no brainer to go, what is the simplest way and what is actually the way


00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.920
I can solve the problem?


00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:18.080
And then just by having adopted that mentality early on, you basically hack the problem,


00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.080
And then also coming from more business marketing background,


00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.080
again, I'm not thinking about what is the fancy, shiny new tool that I want to use.


00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:32.080
Sometimes I do now because I'm bored, but this is more for the cases where nobody cares what I'm really doing.


00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.080
And I show something sparkly.


00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:47.080
From my side, I would say it's very important to communicate the solution rather than thinking about whether it's an ML problem or not at the end of the day.


00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:52.680
So if you give the people what they want and with the shine and sparkle that they want,


00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.240
they will forget whether there's AI behind it or not.


00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.880
Having said that though, in consulting experience, sometimes people really come to you and they're


00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.400
like, I want this predictive model and just like leave it or take it.


00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.680
And you do it for them, even though it's not the most, the best approach, or especially


00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.480
if you try to explain maybe that it's not the best approach, but sometimes people just


00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:20.460
need to, I don't know, maybe they have a KPI of having developed one and introduce one


00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.520
ML project into their teams and this is it, like whatever way.


00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.320
So there's some, I think most people here can be reasoned with.


00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.320
Yeah.


00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.320
The stockholders demand more AI, so we need more AI.


00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.280
We don't know what that means, but we definitely need it.


00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.280
No, no, that's, that's great.


00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:43.440
And I do resonate with the idea of just start simple and evolve.


00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:51.440
Like so many people perceive software and software projects in the broader sense as


00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:57.280
I have to think about it for a long time and get it right, rather than let me try to build


00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:02.800
something over a day. And if it doesn't work, I'll try something else. Or we can evolve it over time.


00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:09.520
And maybe that comes from back when software was harder to change and the tools were crummier or


00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.680
or whatever, but yeah, I think just jump in, try something,


00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.160
and go with that.


00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.680
Yeah, I wanted to say something real fast on machine learning


00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.780
especially.


00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.680
And this is something that I think a lot of people


00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.200
don't realize until later on.


00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.720
And I see it time and time again from the veterans


00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.560
in the community coming and answering questions


00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.720
that are being proposed.


00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.040
And that is really taking it back.


00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.740
when you're proposing a solution


00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.520
or when you're asking a question in the community,


00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.800
it's like, but what is it exactly?


00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.880
What is the business value here


00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.000
that you're trying to affect?


00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.920
Because machine learning is so closely tied to business


00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.280
that you can't really, it's like that Venn diagram


00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.280
is so overlapping on the business side


00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.680
and it also has the technology side,


00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.280
but a lot of times we just take for granted


00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.800
that it's technology, but you can't do that, right?


00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.000
like especially with machine learning.


00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.360
Like if you're an SRE and you're just focusing on SLOs


00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.520
and all of that, it's a lot easier to be like,


00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.480
okay, cool, this is a very technology problem.


00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.580
But when you're machine learning, and like Vishnu said,


00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.680
like you really gotta know what kind of metrics


00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.700
are you trying to move the needle on


00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.740
and how are you gonna go about that.


00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.720
So that was just something that I noticed comes up


00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.680
quite a bit from the veterans saying like,


00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.880
wait a minute, slow down.


00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.800
Before you go for that next one,


00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.720
what is it that you're trying to do here?


00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.840
- Probably someone comes in with a question like,


00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.200
I'm trying to make PyTorch do this thing


00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.320
and I'm having a hard time.


00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.160
And like, whoa, whoa, whoa,


00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.360
but do you really need to do it that way?


00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.680
Like, is that really, maybe it's cool or whatever,


00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.160
but is that really what you need in this situation?


00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.000
Could you just--


00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.040
- Actually, that's exactly what it is.


00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.280
And oftentimes it's something even more complicated


00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.480
than that where like, I'm trying to have,


00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.880
you know, I'm trying to use Kubernetes


00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.040
to do this retraining job 100,000 times


00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.160
so I can see which of these models is most effective


00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.440
at this particular metric.


00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.820
And you're like, whoa, whoa,


00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.480
you're about to undertake a huge engineering project


00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.480
with all kinds of complicated tools, why?


00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.760
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.320
Yeah, it's exactly the way it is.


00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.600
- People into existential crisis, so that is.


00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.440
- I guess so.


00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.240
- It's not funny.


00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.560
The audience, Cam asks or says rather,


00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.840
A lot of times I have researchers propose algorithms


00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.260
that are too computationally complex to run


00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.600
at the speed we need for production.


00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.760
And I think that's probably also an interesting thing


00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.400
to consider when you're doing the sort of prototyping,


00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.280
getting things started is maybe here's a algorithm,


00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.200
I'll give you a great answer,


00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.200
but Vishnu, you talked about training 100,000 ways, right?


00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:01.600
Like, can you really spend $25,000 to decide,


00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:07.400
compute in the cloud or something to decide if this is even going to work, right? Or could


00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.360
you do that in production over the data you have or something, right?


00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:16.680
A lot of times in, I'd say like a lot of times in machine learning, our default in terms


00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:22.760
of technical requirements is pretty unilateral, you could say, right? It's like increased


00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:28.200
accuracy or the precision or whatever the score is. But in software engineering, and


00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.440
and other forms of engineering,


00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.600
they're much better at understanding


00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.800
multivariate requirements, right?


00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.120
And I think that's where you see the tension, right?


00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.280
The data scientist says,


00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.080
but this model works at the problem.


00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.280
It does the thing it's supposed to.


00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.000
It's better on this one thing.


00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.560
And the engineer says, well, wait, no,


00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.400
there are a million things I need to think about.


00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.680
I need to think about latency.


00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.960
I need to think about maintainability.


00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.260
I need to think about, you know,


00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.380
how big the file might be.


00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.120
There might be a million different things.


00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.640
And I think that's where you see


00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.880
the kind of thing that Cam's talking about.


00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.480
- Yeah, interesting.


00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.880
- And I think it comes from academia actually,


00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.060
because they just recently, I remember a year ago,


00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:06.060
were doing a meta-science course where they discussed ML,


00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.700
basically model assessment,


00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.740
and how the same researchers


00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.420
could not reproduce their results


00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.380
because they just realized they use different compute.


00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.220
So they will be having different results.


00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.460
And in each of those cases,


00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.700
they realized they need to bring that information in,


00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:28.700
in the academic paper to have comparable scenarios.


00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.460
So maybe you have a little compute,


00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.660
a little compute, and then this is the best model


00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.740
and in the other scenario, the other one is better model.


00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.540
And I think now that there's changes in academia,


00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.780
it will kind of become more standard


00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.780
to consider elsewhere as well.


00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.380
- Yeah, that's a good point.


00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.180
Go ahead, Dimitris.


00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.380
- I was just gonna say that how many times


00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.980
have we heard of stories, and I'm sure people listening


00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.860
have lived these stories of a data scientist coming


00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.020
with a model and it's like, or they go,


00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.700
they get tasked with a problem,


00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.820
they go work on a model for a while


00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.620
and they come back with the accuracy


00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.860
or F score is like perfect.


00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.860
And then they give it to whoever the stakeholder is,


00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.620
another stakeholder and that stakeholder is like,


00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.660
but this is useless to me.


00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.220
I don't care what your accuracy score,


00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.560
you're not actually solving the problem here.


00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.620
And it just goes back to this,


00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.940
Like, make sure you're very clear on what you're optimizing for.


00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:27.540
And then another point I wanted to make, which I feel like is super important,


00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:34.620
is depending on your use case, you really have to be vigilant about what you're


00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.300
trying to do and what you use to get there.


00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:44.180
Because if you're doing like autonomous vehicles, that is a whole nother world as


00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.120
compared to what Vishnu is doing or what Kate's doing, right?


00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.200
Like even if you're just dealing with unstructured data


00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.480
and you have a computer vision problem that's in healthcare


00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.000
and it's deciding if someone has cancer,


00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.280
that takes a lot longer.


00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.040
You can put out like one model


00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.320
and it has to get approved by the FDA.


00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.260
And that takes a long time for it to go through that process.


00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.360
So you don't really care about like updating that model


00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.820
in real time and gathering that data right on the fly.


00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.380
But if you're in autonomous vehicles,


00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.920
that's a whole nother set of problems


00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.460
that you need to get into.


00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.960
And so really like recognizing what is your use case,


00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.600
what is the big things that you need to take into account


00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.000
as you're looking into these use cases?


00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.120
And where do you want to optimize?


00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.920
- For sure, and I definitely want to talk about


00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.720
that trade off of like building the perfect model


00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.780
versus evolving it later.


00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:41.440
So another area that I think is interesting


00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.960
to consider as you're getting started


00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:51.120
has to do with how much compute does it take to solve some of these problems and build


00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:56.640
some of these models like more than a lot of other areas of software development, you


00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:02.200
know, training models takes a ton of energy, which can either mean money or time or both,


00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.920
you know, putting aside like just the carbon costs of like spending a lot of time on servers,


00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:11.720
but just, you know, how are you going to accomplish that? Right? So, you know, how do you think


00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:17.200
about that trade off? Like, can I train this up on my laptop? Or do I need to get a GPU


00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:23.320
cluster? Or what are your thoughts there?


00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:33.440
I mean, I think, you know, it's funny, I actually think the compute part of ml ops is perhaps


00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:40.160
the most solved portion of the stack. You know, we usually think about things in terms


00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:48.560
of data, model, and code in machine learning. Your data is changing. You want your model to


00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.240
change as the data changes, and then your code is just sort of a way that you control


00:33:52.240 --> 00:34:00.400
the model that you're creating based on that data. And when you think about what AWS has done


00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.040
over the last few years to make it more possible than ever, companies like PaperSpace as well,


00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.000
And even, you know, Google Cloud was making cloud free and GPU instances free.


00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.760
Like it's, it's, it's very easy to experiment with compute much more so than ever before.


00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.200
And, and I think that is the hardest part of the process, right?


00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:24.200
It's freedom to experiment, is usually what is the constraint.


00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:24.960
Right.


00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:30.880
and I think, you know, I'll just contrast that with data, right?


00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.080
It's very difficult to, I would say experiment in the machine learning process


00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:41.000
right now with different data sets with trying to work with sort of synthetic data or use


00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.400
different cuts of data that are, you know, correlated with interpretability. That is


00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.840
a very much more complicated area that I would say that I think a lot of machine learning


00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.560
professionals spend a lot of time doing a lot of manual work on, as opposed to compute


00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:00.120
nowadays, which is by and large, I think, like a very experimental and solved problem.


00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.240
- Yeah, excellent.


00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.160
Do you do any edge computing with your,


00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.120
do you do like medical devices or anything,


00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.640
like little devices that people walk around with


00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.400
that you've got to put real-time stuff onto?


00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.760
- I used to, I used to work at a medical device company


00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.320
that was doing an eye imaging device,


00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.000
and we used to put a machine learning model


00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.080
on an ophthalmic imager.


00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.360
And it was interesting.


00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.680
It really gave me a lot of appreciation


00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:33.680
for what some of the folks at Apple and NVIDIA and Fitbit


00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.720
and some of the other sort of bigger companies


00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:40.920
that do a lot of machine learning on device do.


00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.880
It takes a particularly talented group of hardware


00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.920
and software and machine learning professionals


00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.560
to make all that stuff work together.


00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.240
And I would definitely suggest


00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.360
to anybody interested in this field,


00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.520
like check out what NVIDIA is doing.


00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.680
They're doing a lot of really cool stuff.


00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.680
but from what I learned my time doing it,


00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.000
I learned that simplicity is really,


00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.480
it's the way that you can get things done.


00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.280
We were just exporting model weights to a pickle file


00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.800
and then doing some very low level computation


00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.720
to make it as fast as we needed.


00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.560
So that's about my experience working on that level.


00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.360
- Interesting, okay, yeah.


00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.200
I'm always blown away that pickle is still used,


00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.280
but especially in this area, it's pretty--


00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.120
- It works.


00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.320
- I know, it definitely does.


00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.520
It's easy, it's just whatever, just save that,


00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.520
we'll deal with that.


00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:35.640
Let's talk real quick about one thing you have


00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.920
over on the community.


00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.560
You have this, you have a couple of things


00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.440
up at the top here,


00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.360
and one of them is called this feature store.


00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.200
All right, it sounds like it might be helpful


00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.240
for people to get started.


00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.240
Do you wanna tell us about this a little bit?


00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.840
- Yeah, so we tried to, we like set out


00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.520
to demystify a space and like I have so many stories


00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.020
of how this just was like,


00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.040
I didn't know what I was getting myself into


00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.560
when I started creating this because the MLOps,


00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.160
first of all, like right now in machine learning,


00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.680
there's not clear spaces of like, oh, this is this tool


00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.560
and you need this tool if you're doing XYZ


00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.160
and here's the space that it occupies.


00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.040
There's like this tooling sprawl


00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.800
and some tools do a little bit of this


00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.480
and other tools do a little bit of that.


00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.120
And maybe this tool does all of these things


00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.880
but it doesn't get you with that.


00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.120
And so what I've been able to congregate on


00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.000
or like I landed on a few things


00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
that are different spaces that are clearly defined.


00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.920
And one is the monitoring space


00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.520
because I think that's just really easy


00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.320
for people to comprehend.


00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.400
Monitoring is, it's like software development monitoring,


00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.480
but then you add the machine learning aspect to it


00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.940
and you add that data and then boom,


00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.520
you've got lots of new stuff to monitor.


00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.140
And then there's the feature store part.


00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.220
There's also like the metadata management


00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.480
or experiment tracking piece.


00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.120
And then there's the deploy piece.


00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.520
And like, you can ask Vishnu,


00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.680
I've gone back and forth on how we're going


00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.320
to present these things,


00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.560
what we're going to do in order to create,


00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.240
should we create the framework


00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.840
and basically do Gartner's job for them


00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.120
and say like, these are what you should be looking for


00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.880
in the tooling if you're looking for a feature store


00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.880
or if you're looking for a monitoring tool.


00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.480
And that's what we kind of have been trying to do.


00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.020
And we've been working with all the different companies


00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.820
in the community and then also like practitioners


00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.840
who use this and we've been asking them like,


00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.200
hey, is this what you would expect from a feature store


00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.360
or a monitoring company or a metadata management


00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.040
or a deployment tool?


00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.240
The problem is that there's a lot of tools right now


00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.840
that are doing, they're specializing in optimizing compute.


00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.400
And then they also have deployment as a feature.


00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.600
So is that a deployment tool?


00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.280
- Yeah, yeah.


00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.860
Yeah, it's a tricky one.


00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.260
But I guess the takeaway maybe is over on your website,


00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.140
you've got like some different categories


00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.740
that sort of try to do that comparison


00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.660
to help people pick some of these tools, right?


00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.340
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.


00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.860
And so that's where me pulling my hair out


00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.740
for the last like year and a half


00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.200
has been just trying to figure out like what,


00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.560
because I know that if I'm struggling differentiating


00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.480
all of these tools, I'm not the only one, right?


00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.460
And so this is what I go on


00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.500
and people reach out to me quite a bit


00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.740
to tell me about their new MLOps tool,


00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:42.980
and I go onto their website,


00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.180
and I'm like, what exactly do they do?


00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.820
It's always the same stat.


00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.900
You hear like, 80% of machine learning models


00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.460
never make it into production.


00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.620
And that's what they have is their H1 on their website.


00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.660
And then it's like, but what do you do?


00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.740
I don't understand.


00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.860
So we tried to take a non-biased approach


00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:02.300
to figuring that out.


00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.300
- Yeah, very cool.


00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:08.820
Let's move over to the development side.


00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.820
So you sort of figured out your path,


00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.740
you decided it is machine learning problem,


00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.900
how you wanna approach it and so on.


00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:21.980
What are some of the recommendations or techniques


00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.980
that you have for people sort of in that stage


00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.340
of these ML projects?


00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.420
The one that I hear a lot of times is


00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.900
sort of the category I guess is,


00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.740
there's a lot of software engineering practices


00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.520
that don't necessarily get brought into data science.


00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.400
as often as they should, for example, like unit testing


00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.880
or version control or stuff like that.


00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.780
Like, what are your thoughts, Kate and Vishnu especially?


00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:51.160
- I'll let Kate go first.


00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:56.400
- Yeah, it's a good one.


00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.160
I wouldn't call myself a super awesome engineer.


00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.880
I'm still on that path, trying to just be tolerant


00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.320
and understanding to my other folks on the team


00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.800
who actually know what they're doing


00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.240
and not to make their lives too hard.


00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.400
My personal super tiny hack was,


00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.040
especially in the days where I think people


00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.160
are still using notebooks,


00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.480
but I'm using VS Code with this like hash percent percent sign


00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.220
which turns your script into cells.


00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.620
And when I'm done, I just clean it up


00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.160
and it becomes a normal script again,


00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.960
or at least I can basically copy it.


00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.560
- You can still run it, yeah.


00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.480
- I still run it and test it out that way.


00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.920
and that I think really speeds up the process.


00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.800
And of course, yeah, version control.


00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.760
Currently I'm working with teams


00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.200
or just basically either data engineer or SREs


00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.600
who are helping me make things a bit more polished


00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.880
or deploy them a bit better.


00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.640
So I don't have to think about it that much.


00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.480
So I'm happy to hear from Vishnu.


00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.320
- Yeah.


00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.360
- I mean, I think to me,


00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.440
components of the software engineering workflow


00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.800
that I suggest data scientists


00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.800
and machine learning engineers heavily leverage


00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.720
are version control, CI/CD, testing,


00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.960
and in general, clean code, best practices, right?


00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.560
- Code reuse functions rather than just top to bottom


00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.600
with copy paste.


00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.080
- Yeah, I mean, if you do those three, four things,


00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:37.760
like, you know, that's actually, you know, I would say like a good bit of the hard day-to-day


00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.760
stuff, right?


00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:43.280
Just following those best practices and they'll really accelerate you.


00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:49.080
So I try to set those things up, you know, early on in the process of running a project,


00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.520
you know, setting up the repo, GitHub repo the right way, setting up CI/CD to the extent


00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.520
that makes sense.


00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.680
You know, you don't want to over-engineer infrastructure around your project without


00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:03.560
having a project too early on, but I think those kinds of things are very helpful.


00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:09.440
And we had on a guest on our podcast, on our Ops Community podcast, Demetrius and I, a


00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.220
guy named Jesse Johnson, who is the VP of software engineering and data scientists at


00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.320
a company called Dewpoint Therapeutics.


00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:19.440
And he has this concept known as building software from the outside in.


00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.520
And what that means is you start sort of at the finished...


00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.640
You start, like when you're building like a product,


00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.400
a product maybe that involves an API,


00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.360
like define what the API looks like


00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.400
and define what you'd like your end user,


00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.780
what their experience to be like,


00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.960
and then build backwards to all the things


00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.520
that allow for that to happen.


00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.440
And I like to think about the same thing


00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.760
with a machine learning model


00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.800
or with whatever kind of data science output that I have,


00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.560
which is, what do I want that end experience to look like?


00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.960
How elegant should it feel?


00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.160
How reliable, maintainable and well architected should it be?


00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.580
and then build inwards towards that.


00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.880
So that's sort of another software


00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.960
sort of engineering concept I started to apply.


00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.720
- Yeah, a lot of people talk about how unit testing


00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.640
makes your code better.


00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.080
And I think that's actually,


00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.840
you've touched on the key to why that is.


00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.520
Because instead of just thinking about the details


00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.720
of the algorithm, you have to think about like,


00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.920
well, how is this gonna look


00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.560
when somebody tries to use it, right?


00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.120
'Cause that's what you gotta kind of do in the test


00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.560
is use it a little bit.


00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.080
- I talked about one other thing.


00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:21.920
- Yeah, go ahead.


00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.280
- I'm trying to get you guys.


00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.160
- Kate, do you want to go?


00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.000
And then I'll jump in.


00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.280
- I just wanted to do a quick joke


00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.640
that it runs on my machine.


00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.840
So it must be good.


00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.040
(laughing)


00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:33.880
- It must work.


00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:34.700
Do you know about the,


00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.660
it works on my machine certification program?


00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.400
(laughing)


00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.600
- No, what is that?


00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.440
- I hate this.


00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.080
- Oh, it's brilliant.


00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.500
So it has some interesting rules.


00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.400
So yeah, anytime somebody is sort of,


00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.320
can do this, you can give them this stamp


00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.040
And it's brilliant to be certified.


00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.540
You have to compile your application code.


00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:57.340
This is like a language of files.


00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.380
Getting the latest version of any code changes


00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.640
from any other developer is purely optional.


00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:05.920
Launch the app, cause at least one path to be executed.


00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.240
Preferred way to do this is ad hoc manual testing.


00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.260
You can omit this step if the code change


00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.380
was fewer than five lines


00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.440
or in the developer's professional opinion,


00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.540
the code change could not possibly result in an error.


00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.660
Check in your code, certified.


00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:22.900
Oh boy, yeah, I know.


00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:27.340
It's the problem that we all run into, right?


00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:33.460
Is reproducibility and the shareability and so on.


00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:38.260
And you're right that source control and CI and these things


00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.100
are absolutely, absolutely important.


00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.340
One thing-- Dimitris, go ahead and jump in with your thought.


00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.780
Then I want to talk about a tool here real quick.


00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:47.580
>>Dimitris: Oh, yeah.


00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.460
I was just going to say that one of the guests on the Community


00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.460
podcast made an excellent point.


00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.500
We've had two that have come on and talked about testing


00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.500
specifically for machine learning.


00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.100
And one of them, Svet, was talking about how


00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.320
when you properly test--


00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.900
and actually, Mohamed, both of them,


00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.180
they kind of said the same thing in different words.


00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.220
When you have tests set up and they're properly there,


00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.580
not just unit tests, but also like testing the data


00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:17.440
and this kind of stuff, one of the side effects


00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.280
that you get from that is it's documentation.


00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.800
It's like you have these artifacts that are left.


00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:28.280
And so you, as someone who's coming in and jumping in new,


00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.200
you get to see, oh, okay,


00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.600
so this is what's happening with this slice of data.


00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.440
And this is when you are trying to debug something,


00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.480
it gives you a much better picture


00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.360
and it's more clearly laid out


00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.760
than if you were to just leave it all up to chance,


00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.680
we could say.


00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.400
- Yeah, and you know, the open source angle,


00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.560
if you're looking at some package or library


00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.320
to use for your code, and you go and check it out,


00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.720
and it has no tests, there's a good chance you're like,


00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.320
ah, this thing's not really ready.


00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.960
People are not putting the effort to make sure


00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:06.240
it's good enough to remain good enough over time,


00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.920
and to help onboard new contributors


00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.240
that you really wanna depend upon it, right?


00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.760
So I think there's that angle that's important as well.


00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.560
The two tools I wanted to talk about really quick


00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:22.080
in this area is this thing called DCV,


00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.760
which is open source version control


00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.120
for machine learning projects.


00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.760
Maybe, and then also before that is NBDev from fast.ai.


00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.640
Vishnu, you spoke about using get


00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.320
and checking in your stuff and so on.


00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.440
And one of the challenges, I think notebooks are great,


00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.860
but one of the challenges of them


00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.980
is they kind of save their output in the file


00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.660
and every run potentially could be generating


00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.740
a different output, which means some like


00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:52.180
meaningless Git merge conflict problem


00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.180
you gotta deal with.


00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:58.900
Do you have ideas to fix some of that stuff


00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.500
or do you use anything like NBDev


00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.980
to sort of make that simpler?


00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.620
- Good question.


00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:08.700
I like paper mill a lot.


00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.620
I follow the Netflix approach for--


00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:11.460
- Yeah.


00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:15.660
working with notebooks, I think that they're a very useful tool.


00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.660
I think that if you're...


00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.660
Give us a quick summary of what the Netflix philosophy there is.


00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:21.660
Sure, yeah.


00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.660
I really should do that.


00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:31.940
Basically, Netflix's point is, you know, notebooks are a really effective, interactive prototyping


00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:40.100
tool that if given really prescriptive guardrails can be a part of a production process.


00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.600
And they use notebooks in production at Netflix.


00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.480
And they really encourage their use internally and they've developed a lot of tools that


00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:54.620
help make sure that, you know, the known flaws of notebooks, such as the state element that


00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:58.720
you pointed out, don't lead to things falling off the rails.


00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.160
And that's the way I like to think about it as well.


00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.640
I don't use an NBDev myself.


00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:11.880
But I do think it's a great project that for people who are thinking about using notebooks,


00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.880
they should check out.


00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.240
I think another tool that I've heard of is called Plumber.


00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:21.840
But the most important thing is when you're using notebooks, I think rather than getting


00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.960
into a holy war about whether they're the best tool or not, it's understanding that


00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.040
is it the right tool for my job?


00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.040
I view the right context for that as being when iteration


00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.020
and speed is of the essence,


00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.660
there is no tool that is better than a Jupyter Notebook.


00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.100
It's just, it just, there isn't.


00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.860
And then we have the empirical proof for that.


00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.740
So let's just find ways of putting process around it


00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.000
to make it work.


00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.600
- Sure. Yeah, that makes sense.


00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.680
What about tools like DCV,


00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.660
some of these version control systems?


00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:57.660
You know, part of the problem is the data sets


00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:58.620
and data science in general,


00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.940
but machine learning as well,


00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.820
it's just like, it doesn't necessarily make sense


00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:03.480
to check them directly into,


00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.820
into Git, you know?


00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:08.660
- Yeah.


00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.820
- Yeah, so some tools like this have sprung up


00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:15.820
to allow for sort of a side-by-side store of your data,


00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.180
but it's also tracked in Git,


00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.760
but not entirely stored in Git.


00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:22.220
So do you, Kate or Vishnu, or do you using this?


00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:25.860
- This is funny 'cause I try, I'm trying not to,


00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.540
but this is exactly the space that that company


00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:31.040
that went out of business at the beginning of the podcast.


00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.160
This is what they were playing in and trying to make--


00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.820
- Oh, interesting, okay.


00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:39.320
- But yeah, I'll let Kate and Vishnu give their opinions.


00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.040
- Yeah, it's also the kind of tool


00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.560
that you would have to categorize


00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:47.560
into your Gartner four quadrant thing, right, somehow.


00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.880
- What I found, what's so interesting is that,


00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:54.680
I mean, just, this is, and this is horrible to say,


00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.920
but people have, it feels like people have


00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.160
so many other problems with getting their machine learning


00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:06.040
into production that this is almost like a secondary thing


00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.680
that comes afterwards or they don't necessarily care


00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:14.520
as much about this because it is, it's like--


00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.200
- There's bigger, more significant problems, right?


00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.760
That are just like, we've got to solve this


00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.960
for this even matter, yeah.


00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.720
- That's not to say there's not a lot of people out there.


00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.440
I know there's a ton of people that use DVC.


00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.640
Their community is huge.


00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:29.640
It's a great tool, but I do think about that sometimes.


00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:33.600
Like, yeah, there's mission critical things


00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.040
that are really top of mind.


00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.280
And everybody likes to talk about how reproducibility


00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.520
is very important for them, but unless you're in banking


00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.420
and you need to because of the law,


00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:49.520
it's not necessarily the most important thing for them.


00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.360
- Sure.


00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.680
- I would say in my experience,


00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.120
versioning and lineage and stuff


00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.560
tends to be the province of data engineering teams


00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.880
a lot more than it is machine learning engineers.


00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.480
And the way that we think about data


00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.040
in a machine learning context


00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:10.360
as sort of one-off artifacts


00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.960
that we need to associate with a particular experiment


00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.440
is not compatible


00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.600
with the way a lot of data engineering teams


00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.680
think about their data sets as being sort of like


00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:23.620
a baked cake, you know, that is ready for consistent use


00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.800
going forward, right, to use that sort of cake analogy


00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.640
that's common in data engineering.


00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.640
So like, you know,


00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:37.320
I personally, I use DVC, I think it's a well-created tool.


00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.800
It didn't exactly solve my problems.


00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.740
I'm a big believer, like if you're a machine learning


00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.460
engineer and you're having data versioning problems,


00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.440
like go learn a little bit about, you know,


00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.280
data engineering and learn about data warehouses


00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.640
and databases and how you can leverage the existing tools


00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.980
in that field, rather than trying to use,


00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:57.020
maybe something that might have been spun up


00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.460
for a very specific purpose or adopt a platform


00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.540
like a Packarderm that has an end-to-end approach


00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.060
to thinking about the entire machine learning pipeline


00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.500
that does dataset versioning,


00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.420
that helps you do your experiment tracking


00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.220
and helps you with sort of your deployment.


00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:14.580
That's kind of my approach to thinking about


00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.900
dataset versioning as a component


00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.420
of the overall ML workflow.


00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.780
- Okay, interesting.


00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:19.620
Kate, what are your thoughts?


00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:20.460
- Yeah, we expect them more, yeah.


00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.700
So we don't use any specific tools.


00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.980
We're going as many larger companies


00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.420
building our own set of tools, of course,


00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.660
made by people who might not ever touch machine learning


00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:33.780
in their whole lives,


00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.340
with some other people who complain


00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:36.860
about how their models don't work.


00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:38.500
So trying to make everyone happy,


00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.220
but essentially, yes, it's basically our data engineers


00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.220
trying to integrate some kind of extra metadata


00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.420
in our deployment tools


00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.420
so that we know that we can backtrack


00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:52.360
those specific training sets whatsoever


00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.120
to the models that we're training or deploying and so forth.


00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:59.060
So basically it's as Vishnu said,


00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:03.160
in the realm of data engineers who are making things happen,


00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.160
they're the greatest people of them all.


00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.920
- Two thoughts.


00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.320
One, before people get too tied up


00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.480
about trying to be perfect,


00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:16.400
like putting just your notebooks and your scripts


00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:19.880
into version control and straight again is like 80%.


00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:23.540
It's gotta be so much better than not doing anything.


00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:28.960
And then two, I'm fascinated by this comment, Kate,


00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.320
about built by people who don't do machine learning


00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.420
for machine learning.


00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.240
How's that sort of interaction?


00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:40.740
Is that challenging to cross that boundary or whatever


00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.760
to work with folks, companies like that,


00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.320
that are not quite totally experienced


00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.800
of what you're building?


00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.800
- I think it's funny for me because I come from consulting


00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.520
where we kind of closely work together with data engineers


00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.960
and there was kind of always an overlap of your tasks


00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.960
and now I'm coming to a larger organization


00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.760
where people's tasks are pretty well outlined


00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.880
and their responsibilities are more narrow.


00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.560
And sometimes people treat me like, I don't know,


00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.520
something between an alien and dinosaur


00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:11.000
because they have never interacted with like a data scientist


00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:17.240
machine learning person and ask me questions. Like, I don't know, I'm going to just tell them


00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.960
what's the meaning of life all of a sudden. >> We have this data. Find the answers.


00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:27.640
>> And usually it's very basic stuff, but I think it's very important to have those people


00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.720
in the organization. Some people call them data strategists. Some people call them just


00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:37.240
fun people to talk to, like Dimitris, you know, who will bridge that gap and make sure that


00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:44.040
everybody's heard and translated to each other's language to just get that set of requirements


00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:49.440
and not build what data engineers want to build or build just what data scientists want


00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:52.400
to build and create that connection between the two.


00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.400
So that is important.


00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.400
Yeah.


00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.400
Yeah.


00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.520
Very cool.


00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.800
So let's move over to the operations side.


00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:04.640
Now, on the upside, I guess the first thing


00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.160
I really wanna think about is


00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:10.400
where do you run your code?


00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.760
Where do you run your models and APIs


00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:13.740
that back them and stuff?


00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.840
And I looked over around here


00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.760
and I see a lot of stuff about Kubernetes


00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:24.120
on the community for you all.


00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:29.120
And so Kubernetes, Linux virtual machines,


00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.100
run in the cloud?


00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:34.020
Does that take too much to run in terms of sort of compute


00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:36.860
costs you would rather run it locally and your own servers?


00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.540
What are your thoughts on this?


00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:45.580
- I mean, to me, it depends on how intensive


00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:48.060
your training efforts are and how many models


00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:49.900
you have in production, right?


00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.780
Setting up a Kubernetes cluster for one model


00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:56.460
seems to me like overkill, but for a company that's,


00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.000
has tens or hundreds of models in production,


00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.920
it might make a lot of sense, right?


00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.800
To try and set up some sort of distributed training


00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.120
architecture, et cetera.


00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.760
- Especially if someone else is maintaining


00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.920
that cluster for you, right?


00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.840
- Yeah.


00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.200
- One thing to say, I want to have,


00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.460
I want to create and babysit a Kubernetes cluster


00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:16.840
versus I want to be able to give my job to Kubernetes.


00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.640
- Yeah. - It's the same, right?


00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:19.840
- Exactly, yeah, yeah.


00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.260
So I think it really depends on, you know,


00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:23.400
what scale you're at.


00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.680
And that's kind of what we talk a lot about


00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.500
in the community.


00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.680
If you're confused about what scale you're at


00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.200
or what maturity level you're at,


00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.560
I invite you, please join the Slack,


00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.680
the MLOps community Slack,


00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.480
and I'm sure people will be able to provide


00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.160
some very tactical suggestions for your size.


00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.160
But I guess my answer to you is it depends.


00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.280
- Okay.


00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.280
Kate? - I will say--


00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.760
- Or, do we just go ahead? - Go ahead, Kate.


00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:47.440
Go ahead. - I got it.


00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.120
- I would say use the path of least resistance.


00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:52.880
So whatever is there, whatever is available,


00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.720
what is the easiest way to source your data?


00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:59.000
what are the connections that are already set up?


00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.200
Again, because sometimes you work with different teams


00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.380
or in consulting different companies.


00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.640
So that's about it.


00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.600
And if I'm lucky enough, like right now,


00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:13.100
to have a cluster that is babysitted by another person,


00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.640
well, good, then it's a deal, you know?


00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:17.240
Just take it.


00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.960
This runs on my machine.


00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.800
- Exactly.


00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:24.040
What about Docker?


00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:27.800
I mean, I know, sorry, keep going off, go ahead, Dimitris.


00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:31.800
- Yeah, there's been, I mean, we should like pour out


00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.720
some whiskey or whatever, some drink


00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:39.000
for lots of data scientists that have gone in


00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.740
to the Kubernetes world thinking they were gonna pick it up


00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:45.240
and get their models out because they needed to.


00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.860
For some reason, they got brainwashed into thinking like,


00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:50.960
oh yeah, I should just learn Kubernetes real fast.


00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.640
And they never were able to come back.


00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.960
- Yeah, and it's like such a huge detour, right?


00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:00.120
And so we talk about this a lot,


00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.400
and that is like, first of all,


00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.480
what should the team composition look like


00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:07.600
as a machine learning like squad or team


00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.480
or someone trying to just get value out of it?


00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.560
And should a data scientist have to know Kubernetes?


00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.000
And so that's kind of like the joke here


00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
is like Kubernetes is a gateway drug.


00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.720
If you can get past it, if you can get into it,


00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.160
then you're probably gonna go a lot deeper.


00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.280
but it's really hard to pick up,


00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.480
especially if you're coming from a data science background.


00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.720
- Yeah, that's a whole other thing to learn.


00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:33.560
Right on, Kate.


00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.840
- Exactly.


00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.960
- Yeah, Pimple in the audience has an interesting comment


00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.080
that I would love to echo as well.


00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.800
Also, don't forget you're not Google, right?


00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.520
And you're not Facebook, and you're not Instagram,


00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.340
and you're not, you know, all these companies


00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:51.600
that are trying to run at such an insane scale, right?


00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:56.600
that they have to come up and use very interesting


00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:59.340
deployment in DevOps,


00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:03.240
whereas maybe just running it on a server is fine.


01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.080
I don't know.


01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:09.380
- That's probably the most shared blog in the community


01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.700
is that you are not Googled blog.


01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.140
- Yeah, yeah, that was a great article.


01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.260
Came out like a year and a half ago


01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.860
or something like that, I think.


01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:21.540
- I wanted to add one more comment about that.


01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.540
Yeah, go for it.


01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:26.940
Which is, there's a, you know, he's a community member in our community, but also is very


01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:34.100
well known, you know, in the general ML community, Jacopo Talibue, who's the director of AI at


01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.100
Covio.


01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:39.000
He's been putting out a series of articles known as ML Ops at Reasonable Scale.


01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.180
And I think it talks a lot about this entire concept, which is like a lot of what the discussions


01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.780
are driven by about ML is about ML at unreasonable scale.


01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:55.060
It's the Googles and the Ubers that are doing hundreds of millions and billions of events.


01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.340
And for many of us, that's not the reality.


01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:01.220
And what Mike just pulled up here, it's a great series that I encourage everyone to


01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.740
read who feels like, "Hey, that's not applicable to me.


01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.740
What is?"


01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.740
This answers that.


01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.580
And we had a month for a podcast as well.


01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.580
Nice.


01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:09.580
Yeah.


01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.380
The subtitle here is "ML Ops Without Too Much Ops."


01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.380
Yep.


01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.380
That's good.


01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:14.380
I like it.


01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.380
And it's the same idea.


01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.540
- Yeah, it sounds just very focused on machine learning


01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.700
rather than just broad software development.


01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:27.500
Do any of you all use like software as a service type places?


01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.900
I'm thinking of stuff like Streamlit, for example,


01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.060
like Streamlit Cloud and these types of things


01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.100
where kind of build your model and you're just like,


01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:35.940
here, go run it.


01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:40.460
I mean, Heroku would be sort of a similar website


01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.420
equivalent of that.


01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:47.220
- So we do use Streamlit, but we don't use the cloud.


01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.420
- That's an interface.


01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.900
- Right, you can self-host it yourself, right?


01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.740
- We hosted ourselves because then authentication


01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.300
and everything else is kind of linked to it.


01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.820
And then we forget just a nice interface.


01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.920
- Yeah, what are your thoughts on Streamlit?


01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.300
- It's awesome.


01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:08.340
- Yeah, I haven't had to use it for anything,


01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:12.580
but my experience is that like it's the amount of code


01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:15.620
that you have to write to create these


01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:19.880
really interactive dashboards, it's super, super short.


01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.860
- Yeah, and I mean, the alternative usually


01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:23.900
in the organization is that,


01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.560
oh, we have this Tableau dashboard, right?


01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.780
And that requires licenses and training for people.


01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.060
And again, it has its own limitations.


01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.540
At some points with certain amount of data,


01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.380
it just starts crashing.


01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:41.320
And this is an easy way for machine learning professionals


01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.120
showcase whatever they're working on in a way.


01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.880
And it's been a lifesaver for us.


01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.640
Sometimes people just don't get what the hell you're talking about.


01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:54.800
So we were working on an NLP tool that would analyze a lot of unstructured


01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.160
text in a lot of different ways.


01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.640
And we just plugged all the possible ways to visualize that result.


01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.320
And it just clicked for people.


01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.120
And then you add a nice little video next to it, you know, it's just so flexible.


01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:06.600
Yeah.


01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.280
It's really cool.


01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.720
The nice part is it's not just a static notebook output, right?


01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.480
You can sort of play with the dropdowns,


01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.400
click in the places, and it becomes a live,


01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.880
little interactive thing without you


01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.120
having to learn some sort of front-end programming


01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.440
framework like Vue.js or something.


01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.240
Yeah, exactly.


01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.840
And also, on the other hand, we had developed this package


01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.000
to do the analysis.


01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.760
But this gives a no-code interface for people


01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.920
to completely just do it by themselves.


01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.040
And they feel really cool about interfacing


01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.360
with machine learning without having that background,


01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.200
without having to--


01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.120
- Oh, that's cool.


01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.600
Think of it as like a hybrid, right?


01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.520
Like build the real software development bit


01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.020
and then expose it to things like Streamline.


01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.520
Yeah, cool.


01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.800
Vishnu, what are your thoughts?


01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.080
- No, I agree with everything Kate said.


01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.800
I think it's, I remember when it came out,


01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.520
it was, it came out with a lot of great examples


01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.480
and it came out with a lot of,


01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.000
you know, at the time,


01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.080
it was still TensorFlow 1.0, two hadn't come out,


01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.240
and it was really, really hard


01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.080
to work with machine learning models.


01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.960
It was like you had these underlying graphs


01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.880
that you had to kind of struggle with,


01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.780
and people spent so much time just wrangling,


01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:26.780
like how do I get an output for this model training exercise


01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.760
that to have this like really neatly written package


01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.440
that would just take that as a backend


01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.120
and then let me make interactive visualizations


01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.720
like magic. All great tools feel like magic. And I think that's what Streamlit did well.


01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:45.280
As Kate said, it allows non-technical users to interact with outputs of models very naturally,


01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.480
which I think is a really important part of connecting some of this technical to business


01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:54.720
value. And there's a whole set of tools like Streamlit that have since come out that are


01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:59.840
making various parts of the machine learning workflow or the operations workflow a lot easier,


01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.800
whether it's sort of letting you set up APIs


01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.920
on top of those models or visualizations


01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.480
or all kinds of other sort of aspects.


01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.560
So started with--


01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.400
- Yeah, absolutely.


01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.560
For me, the magic is you write a function


01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.160
that looks like it just takes arguments


01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.280
and you don't have to deal with callbacks


01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.320
and interactive stuff.


01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.120
And it just kind of adds that into there.


01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.880
What are some of the other tools like this


01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.640
that people might be using out there


01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.200
to get their ML models online?


01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:36.200
FastAPI right now is really popular as like a way of, you know, serving your model.


01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.200
That's API, not FastAI, right?


01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.200
Yeah, FastAPI.


01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.200
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.


01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:48.200
FastAPI is really popular. There's a new tool I heard of called Banana, which also does this.


01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.200
Banana.dev.


01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.200
Okay.


01:05:50.200 --> 01:06:00.600
Yeah, I mean, I think there's still early on, you know, I'm struggling to remember off


01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.080
the top of my head right now.


01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:08.040
But, you know, just in general, this paradigm of saying like, hey, if I can, like, write


01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:13.400
a neat, sort of like modern Python library, where I can write, as you said, a function


01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:17.360
with a couple arguments, and then do things that are associated with the machine learning


01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.240
workflow, that's a model that works.


01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.360
So like great expectations kind of does that with data testing.


01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.780
You know, kind of works like pytest for data.


01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:31.420
And so I think what we're trying to do overall, the big picture is bring, you know, very Pythonic


01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:36.780
ways of working with code into the realm of data and machine learning models to the extent


01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.300
that makes sense.


01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:45.220
Yeah, banana.dev is totally new to me.


01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.220
Interesting.


01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.420
ML model hosting as an API.


01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:52.500
Instant scalable interface hosting


01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.220
for your machine learning models on serverless GPUs.


01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.940
There's a lot of words there that


01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:01.140
mean interesting stuff about running in production.


01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.600
Kate, are you familiar with Banana?


01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.020
Do you have other tools like this you think are neat?


01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.580
No, I couldn't name anything on top of my head.


01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:09.780
Just blanking out.


01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:11.380
I always blank out at questions.


01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.540
I'm like, what's amazing?


01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:17.100
- Google Colab is the most amazing thing that ever happened


01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.180
I think to data scientists,


01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.940
apart from like the original notebooks


01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.060
because it's just like,


01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.300
it's right there with all your random files in the drive.


01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.780
You can just hook it up, test something quickly.


01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:32.020
So, but that's not related to this.


01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:37.020
- Sure, what roles do places like Google Colab


01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:41.460
and these other hosted notebook places serve


01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:42.980
in the production side?


01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:48.260
I clearly see the value when I'm doing some development and prototyping and trying to


01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:49.420
figure stuff out.


01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:55.300
But would you ever try to make that the final version in production?


01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:01.820
I'm not sure how it interacts with GCP in production.


01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.660
So I tried it for my pet projects.


01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:09.460
It was very fun because I had to transcribe some random lectures.


01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:12.500
And I decided, hmm, what if Google can do that for me?


01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.900
And I literally had it all in my drive


01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:19.800
and ran some code in Colab, linked it to GCP


01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.420
and it gave me all the results.


01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:22.480
So that was like pretty neat


01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.520
because I really didn't have to do any kind of configuration,


01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.180
any kind of thought into it.


01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.140
So for pet projects, that was amazing.


01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:35.140
For production, Databricks notebooks kind of work well.


01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.540
Again, especially if you're in Azure,


01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.820
I'm not sure how it interacts with Azure,


01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.760
if it's as convenient.


01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:45.400
But with Azure Cloud, it was just amazing.


01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.560
It was so much less.


01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.160
As soon as you have your credentials figured out,


01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.080
everything works in the background,


01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:54.140
you just do it as you would do it in a normal notebook


01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.560
and you can put it in prod, no problem.


01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.400
- Yeah, fantastic.


01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.160
That's a good recommendation.


01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.840
All right, I think we are just out of time,


01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.600
so I wanna let you all get back to things


01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.640
before you gotta run.


01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.440
But, Kate, Vishnu, thank you for being here.


01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.440
Dmitry has had to run off, but thank you to him as well.


01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:19.360
Your final thoughts, maybe people want to get started


01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.040
with the MLOps community


01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.560
and maybe get their models in production.


01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.880
Give us your final thoughts.


01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.160
Kate, you want to start?


01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.920
- I think the best way, if you're really just starting out,


01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:34.140
go and meet people in person and the MLOps community


01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:37.720
or any other community that is available in your area


01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.400
will give you the right boost of motivation


01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.400
and also knowledge and just create a support network


01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.840
for you to be able to get through the blocks


01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.520
that you will definitely have on your path.


01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.680
So that would be my word of advice.


01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.560
Don't stay alone, isolated.


01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.360
- Yeah, for sure.


01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.920
Vishnu?


01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.900
- I think that's a great tip, Kate.


01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:02.600
I mean, to anybody starting out in MLOps,


01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.080
I would say, certainly join the community


01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.880
and search the answers to that question


01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:12.060
because it's been asked before in the Slack community


01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.600
and there are a lot of great answers.


01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.160
I would also say like, you know,


01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.580
check out some established resources like, you know,


01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.380
I think a guy named Goku Mohandas has been like,


01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.200
you know, putting together a website, you know,


01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.920
let me just look it up real quick.


01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.320
What's it called?


01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.340
I think it's called ML, Made with ML.


01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:33.040
Made with ML is a great resource.


01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.560
Chip Huyan, Stanford class on machine learning systems


01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.000
design, Eugene Yan, our Slack community.


01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.080
These are places that you can just pick up


01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.120
years worth of knowledge very quickly.


01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.960
It's organized for you, it's structured for you.


01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.880
So definitely make use of those existing resources.


01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.080
- Fantastic.


01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.320
All right, well, thank you for being here.


01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.240
It's been really great to hear your experience


01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.080
and thoughts, so thanks for coming by.


01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.200
- Thanks for having me.


01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.040
- Thanks for having me too, my pleasure.


01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.280
- You bet, bye-bye.


01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.280
- Yeah.
