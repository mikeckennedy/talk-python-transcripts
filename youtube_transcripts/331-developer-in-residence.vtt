00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
- Hello, everyone out there on YouTube.


00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Thank you for being here.


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.480
Thank you for being part of our recording, our live stream.


00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.960
If you're here live, throw something into the chat.


00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.560
We'll try to make it part of the show.


00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.440
Got comments, thoughts for Lucas, that would be great.


00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.960
If you're watching later, well, thanks for watching.


00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.800
All right, Lucas, ready to kick this off?


00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.640
- Sure.


00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.480
- Lucas, welcome back to Talk Python to Me.


00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.240
- Well, I'm very happy to be here.


00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.080
- It's the first time you can see me as well, I guess.


00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.160
So it's kind of a new thing for me.


00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.500
So first times, first times.


00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.680
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.520
Well, you've been on the show three times before.


00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.400
You talked about, let's see,


00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.560
the very first one was gradual typing


00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.120
of production applications,


00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.080
and that was applying TypeHence and mypy over on Instagram,


00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.720
which was fantastic work,


00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.840
and I loved what you're doing there.


00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.240
Then we talked about the Python Language Summit.


00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.920
you gave us a wrap up on that or a rundown on that


00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.920
for 2018 and then diving into CPython 3.8 and beyond.


00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.680
So, here we are again, thanks for being back.


00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.000
- Yeah, happy to be here.


00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.480
Like 3.8 is now already an old release, right?


00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.860
It's already in security only fixes mode.


00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.240
So yeah, like it was new at the time.


00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.160
- Yeah, it was, I think when we were talking about it,


00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.220
it's like, what are the new exciting features?


00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.900
I guess while we're on that topic, just real quickly,


00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.100
is what are the new features that you're excited about now,


00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.140
either 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11?


00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.860
What's out now?


00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.260
What's just about out, and what's coming soon?


00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.940
Yeah, so there's quite many.


00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.300
The one that I'm living with the most right now


00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.980
is actually just better error messages.


00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.100
So this is a trend that is still happening.


00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.260
so there's further changes for 3.11 later,


00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.540
which is already like the main branch right now


00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.380
of development, right?


00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.780
So 3.10 is already in release candidate mode.


00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.660
So like we're gonna get the second release candidate


00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.300
pretty soon and then, you know, the final release.


00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.820
So all new features now go to 3.11 already.


00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.060
But the better error messages, like really kind of,


00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.380
you know, they're kind of this icing on the cake


00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.700
that make, you know, stuff much nicer for you.


00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.580
There's a bunch of typing changes


00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.100
that I was really looking forward to back in PEP 484 times,


00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.660
like when we first added string,


00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.600
well, annotations to Python.


00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.620
I always kind of wanted them to feel more native


00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.820
inside your code.


00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.440
And now with Python 3.10, you can use,


00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.980
I guess it's PEP 604, like union types,


00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.420
like that kind of are not so verbose.


00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.420
they use the pipe operator instead of spelling out


00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.820
capital case union of whatever,


00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.620
which is kind of more compact


00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.580
and also more readable through this, right?


00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.820
Because like now types that aren't super trivial


00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.820
don't look as scary anymore, right?


00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.860
'Cause like you kind of don't have to have


00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.460
the square brackets so much and whatnot.


00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.300
- Yeah.


00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.820
people who haven't explored this deeply,


00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.000
there previously was basically a parallel,


00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.780
a mirrored hierarchy of types


00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.720
that weren't actually the types, but they described the type.


00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.620
So from typing import capital L list,


00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.500
that would say you're returning a lowercase L list


00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.980
as your type.


00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.460
And then it got even more interesting


00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.100
when you have like optional, right?


00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.180
I have an optional user that's returned from this query.


00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.540
And now you can just do things like user pipe none


00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.620
and things like that.


00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.460
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.260
So this was fun, but also like what I really kind of


00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.620
like to use is that like the lowercase types


00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.020
just feel more natural, right?


00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.940
So, you know, kind of just putting dicts and lists


00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.500
and whatever, like just straight out of built-ins


00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.460
and just applying generics to them just kind of looks right.


00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.300
Like feels right.


00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.660
- Yeah, it always felt weird.


00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.420
Like, why do I have to do an import just to talk


00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.420
about this thing I'm already using, right?


00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.540
- Yeah, because if you actually look at how the feature


00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.540
was enabled to allow lowercase list of string and whatnot,


00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.200
this is now part of the interpreter.


00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.580
This was kind of changed deeply in the C code


00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.040
of the interpreter back in 2014,


00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.300
when we first released PEP 484.


00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.620
The value of typing wasn't really so clear cut yet.


00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.740
It was a new idea.


00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.140
We wanted to have this out,


00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.140
we wanted to have people actually test it and say, you know, is this something that Python


00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.140
could actually see value in? So it was a little too early to make, you know, drastic changes to


00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.460
the interpreter just because it would be handy to have for typing. Like, it's kind of, you know,


00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.140
icky in the sense that between here and there, we clearly have this transition period where


00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.420
typing just becomes more natural to use and more ergonomic.


00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.860
And obviously, the tooling like mypy matures,


00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.700
but it's what you have to do if you are dealing with a language that is 30 years old.


00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.340
Right. So we didn't have this clean room experience because the language was already successful.


00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.380
It was already out there.


00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:39.540
So, yeah, like a bunch of new languages now have this comfort, like have this luxury of just being able to just,


00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.540
you know, can look at an empty page


00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.820
and just design from scratch.


00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.660
Like we have--


00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.500
- Yeah, the one that comes--


00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.460
Yeah, yeah, for sure.


00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.820
I mean, Python is 30 years old, right?


00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.660
The language that gives me sort of,


00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.400
that comes to mind when you say that is Swift, right?


00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.100
Swift took a bunch of these ideas,


00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.180
like you have to explicitly say,


00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.100
here's a nullable reference type and whatnot.


00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.300
But like all of that stuff was done looking back at,


00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.980
you know, Python, at C#, at C++,


00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.900
at all these languages that, you know,


00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.440
and then sort of put together the pieces, right?


00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.920
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.160
Like Swift in particular, I kind of like,


00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.560
you know, kind of, it fits my brain.


00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.220
Like I talk with Corey Benfield every now and again about it


00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.560
like he's now working on it actually at Apple.


00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.400
So yeah, I do feel it's a good evolution of Objective-C


00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.520
since, you know, kind of, it's where it all kind of


00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.640
started from. - Yeah, it's definitely


00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.880
an improvement.


00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.440
I don't want to go too far down the rat hole,


00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.640
but I do wish it had something like


00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.980
a better standard library like Python has.


00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.300
I feel like the language is good,


00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.520
but then when I want to do stuff,


00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.100
I'm like, "Oh, there's so much missing


00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.740
"from the foundation of it in terms of the functionality."


00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.060
Anyway, long story short,


00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.520
'cause it still depends on the whole Objective-C


00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.680
sort of really funky class library stuff.


00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.520
- Oh, yeah.


00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.520
- Yeah, I'm sure I'll get mail about that.


00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.240
(both laughing)


00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.000
All right, so sorry, I super derailed you.


00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.680
What else is exciting that's coming in the near term?


00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:17.040
- Well, of course, like the biggest kind of feature


00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.320
that was most controversial probably


00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.040
is the match statement, right?


00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.320
So pattern matching in Python.


00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.480
It is a huge feature.


00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.680
It kind of changes how some of the code


00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.280
that you're dealing with looks.


00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.320
And also it kind of introduces for the first time


00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.720
this concept of context specific keywords, right?


00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.680
Like that's something that maybe not so many


00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.400
what's new in Python 3.10 posts kind of touch on,


00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.720
but just notice that you can still use match


00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.920
and case as regular variable names.


00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.000
You can still name your functions that,


00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.860
you can still use this as argument names


00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.600
and whatnot and whatnot.


00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.640
But when the Python grammar discovers,


00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.920
when the parser sees that, oh, this is in a place


00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.460
where it fits a construct that looks like a match statement,


00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.520
it'll deal with that and it'll parse that successfully.


00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.400
That is what we could do having


00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.840
this new peg parser that it started in Python 3.9,


00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.680
like it was released then already,


00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.200
but without any new features.


00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.840
Like now in Python 3.10,


00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.620
we're getting the match statement.


00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.880
I'm still, to be honest with you,


00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.680
before this area where I can tell you that I have


00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.640
A lot of experience writing match statements is super useful for me and whatnot.


00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.080
I've written a few of them where it actually made sense and made the code, well, I couldn't


00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.680
really say shorter because usually it actually doesn't, but much more readable because it's


00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:55.800
kind of flatter, it's easier to parse, visually, I mean, by person.


00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.960
But it's not something that I really use daily.


00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.400
somebody is really worried about like, "Hey, what is Python becoming? It's such a complex


00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.660
feature. What about the kids? Think of the children." I always tell them like, "Hey,


00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:15.120
how many descriptors did you implement in your last week or month?"


00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.560
True. How many meta classes have you worked with? That's a good point.


00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.160
It's almost like another feature like this where sometimes it will make perfect sense,


00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.000
But most often, just like with assignment expressions,


00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.640
most often, you won't see them.


00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.800
You won't be using those.


00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.880
>>Yeah.


00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.240
OK, well, fantastic.


00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:42.680
You know, you're talking about the foundational stuff,


00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.440
like the PEG parser.


00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.760
That's not a feature that a bunch of people are saying,


00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.120
I can't wait for a better parser.


00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.720
But it's one of these enabling things.


00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.400
And I feel like this whole role that you're in


00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.320
is sort of in that same idea, right?


00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.760
The same vein that it might not be super public


00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.560
or generate a bunch of new features,


00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.800
but it might be making things a lot smoother for everyone


00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.440
who wants to come along and do those things.


00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.160
What do you think?


00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.320
>>Victor: Yeah, well, the way I look at it


00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.120
is that there's a lot of us on the core team.


00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.360
and even more people around the core team who are kind of,


00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.760
well, we call them drive-by contributors, right?


00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.520
Like, you know, they would find an issue,


00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.400
just, you know, produce a bunch of pull requests


00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.440
and maybe then kind of disappear.


00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.120
Or maybe they're around, but like not producing more for us.


00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.200
And we are obviously very happy with any contribution.


00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.080
And the sad reality is that like,


00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:50.040
we have more of those than we can realistically review.


00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.600
So the problem isn't even that, you know,


00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.920
you need more people to actually be able to actually produce value.


00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.380
We need people to evaluate the value that we're already getting from the community and


00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:09.340
from each other to be able to actually merge them into mainline and to see how the language


00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.340
evolves.


00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:16.120
Obviously, every year, this changes over the years how Python is developed.


00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.960
We've going to have a bunch of people who are super invested and they're going to be


00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.320
spending crazy amounts of time, including on weekends and whatnot, to work on Python,


00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:32.840
even for free. I know, I did that for a decade. So those contributions are super valued, but usually


00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:40.520
those really don't... Well, those people change, right? You cannot really do this


00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:48.200
in a consistent manner, day in, day out for a long period of time. Your life situation changes,


00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:54.360
your job changes or whatnot and you know like you stop contributing and what happens to Python then


00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:01.800
well we lose some value. Currently we have over 1400 open pull requests and I've been on a mission


00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:09.160
to kind of bring that number down. Currently as I'm looking at it it's 1421. Yeah I just I was


00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.680
looking at this morning here I put it up on the screen for people watching live and wow wow wow


00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.960
That is a lot of information coming in,


00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.240
and not just the sheer number of open ones,


00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.640
but the thing that struck me is I'm reading down


00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.320
and 26 minutes ago, an hour ago, two hours ago,


00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.480
three hours ago, three hours ago, four hours ago, five hours.


00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.160
Like, that's hard to keep up no matter what, right?


00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.920
- Yeah, so like some of those are already reviewed,


00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.680
like the faster implementation of gzip decompress


00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.760
that you have like somewhere on the screen,


00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:51.160
like a little lower than the first one. Yeah, yes, like this on lowest one at the moment.


00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:58.040
So the thing is like there's so many of those that, you know, kind of somebody actually has


00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:04.680
to come in and, you know, day in day out, like butts in seats, just review the value that people


00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:11.640
are already providing for you. Like this particular change actually extracted from an older rejected


00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.240
change is actually providing clear value, right?


00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.640
Like now we're going to have gzip compress and decompress be faster, right?


00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.320
But it is actually not a change that is obvious, right?


00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.520
Like you have eight files that are changed.


00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.560
You really need to see that, oh, there's a lot of code that changed.


00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.600
Some of it actually wasn't.


00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.800
It was just moved so that we could reuse it better.


00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.020
Some of it actually has subtle changes.


00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.100
So this isn't something that many volunteers


00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.440
will be willing to do on their free time


00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.100
because it's mostly kind of, well, it's work.


00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.940
It really is work.


00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.920
- It's the janitorial type of just keep it clean,


00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.180
keep it going.


00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.140
Yeah, the maintenance. - Exactly.


00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.560
- Yeah, exactly.


00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.860
So let's go ahead and actually introduce this main topic


00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.400
here, the big announcement for you.


00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.660
On your blog here, you have,


00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.620
"I am the new CPython developer in residence."


00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.020
Congratulations.


00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:06.860
- Ah, thank you.


00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.060
I'm still very excited about this.


00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.500
Like, you know, back when we only had volunteers doing this


00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.060
and maybe, well, Guido being, you know,


00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.200
kind of tolerated as the BDFL at Dropbox,


00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.980
because obviously he was being paid


00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.580
to actually move my Pi forward, right?


00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.180
Like that was his team,


00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.780
but obviously he did a lot for Python as well.


00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.180
And that was kind of understood by Dropbox that it's fine.


00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.740
And many of us were in the same situation.


00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.900
I was tolerated as a CPython core developer at Facebook


00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.260
and some others were at their own respective companies.


00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.540
So I was super frustrated by this because


00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.620
there's this tremendous value that we're giving to the entire community,


00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.180
including multi-billion dollar corporations.


00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.540
And we only thought like, hey, the expectations are high


00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:59.340
and we want to provide the best tooling that we can for the industry.


00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.920
but it is kind of a hard sell, you know,


00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.720
when your kid wants to go out and, you know,


00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.680
and you're like, oh no, I'm fixing this bug,


00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.360
but at the same time you're doing this for free.


00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.040
So you're thinking, you know, like,


00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.480
where did I go wrong in life?


00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.840
Like, you know, my values are somewhere, you know,


00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.640
not where they supposed to be.


00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.640
So Red Hat actually hired Victor Stinner,


00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.020
like full time to work on Python,


00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.920
but it was still Red Hat.


00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.800
He's still an employee of a company that is for profit.


00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.200
So now the CPython developer in residence is different.


00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.560
It is sponsored by a PSF sponsor,


00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.780
in this particular case by Google.


00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.280
Like Google as a company reached out to the PSF


00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.340
specifically to sponsor stuff like this.


00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.220
And that is amazing.


00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.960
Like I am very happy that they did


00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.760
because I really believe that this is something


00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.800
that might kind of alter how we think about maintenance


00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.880
of a community driven projects like Python.


00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.120
- Yeah, and thank you to Google for doing this.


00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.720
so easy for them to say, well, maybe we could just hire


00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.040
some core developers and they could work on speeding up


00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.740
Google Cloud stuff for Python


00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.120
and we'll let them also contribute back, right?


00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.160
That would be the sort of natural historical way


00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.920
of doing something like that.


00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.760
- Yes.


00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.280
- But here it's like, no, let's actually directly


00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.160
sort of effectively hire a person,


00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.520
but put them in an independent role


00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.960
that just makes Python better.


00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.000
And I think that's interesting, right?


00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.240
- Yeah, like the amazing thing about this


00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.920
is that while I do hope that some of the work


00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.120
that I already did was useful for Google as well,


00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.360
like there is no job description written by them


00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.200
and they're...


00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.860
Right, like it's really independent in this sense


00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.600
and this is what makes it super healthy


00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.160
and kind of, I think, well, sustainable for the future,


00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.840
that it is actually me being able to talk


00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.960
to the steering council, which I do regularly,


00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.960
and to the PSF about, hey, what do we actually need?


00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.080
And we don't have to take into consideration


00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.480
kind of direct value for our sponsors.


00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.440
We are providing indirect value,


00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.640
but we don't have a roadmap where there are certain


00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.040
milestones that we need to reach.


00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.120
Like, it's not like that.


00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.560
So I'm very happy about this difference


00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.200
because we did have sponsors before,


00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.440
like that did have either projects


00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.600
that they really wanted to move forward, right?


00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.320
You know, and we still have those,


00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.720
like so for example, packaging and whatnot,


00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.680
or events that happened, right?


00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.200
So Facebook sponsored, you know, core development sprints.


00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.500
So we had those at the campus two years in a row,


00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.040
and then Microsoft took over,


00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.900
then we had Bloomberg, and then we had COVID.


00:17:52.900 --> 00:18:00.420
You know, so like those things do happen and I'm very happy for those, but this is a kind of a game changer.


00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:13.740
Like we have not done this way of sponsoring a project before, where we're actually thinking about the software world in Python Software Foundation, where we directly sponsor work on the code, on the source code.


00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:22.020
Yeah. The PSF has what, seven, eight, nine full-time employees, but you're the first


00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:28.580
employee who is in a sort of software developer role. I think the closest we had before was a


00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.660
project management role for the new PIP. Is that right?


00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:38.900
Yeah. So like we have that, like there's also E who works on our infrastructure, right? So what


00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:46.500
What is also important for Python, and this is dealt with by the PSF, is to keep the website


00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.820
running and to keep PyPI running, and so on.


00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:56.980
So obviously all of this requires constant supervision, and it's also something that


00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:02.260
you can spend your life working full-time on, and this is what E is doing.


00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:08.180
However, that wasn't contributing to see Python as a repository directly, and this is the


00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.620
entire change here. Yeah that's fantastic. Quick shout out to just the two other


00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:18.980
visionary sponsors we got Bloomberg and Microsoft through Azure. That's I think


00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.460
that's awesome. I think this whole visionary sponsor Google was the first


00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:28.620
one in that category right? Yes that is that is a change in how the PSF was


00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:33.380
looking at sponsorship before like I'm very happy to see that. Like this entire


00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.580
you know developer in residence position was something that I was pretty stressed


00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:43.780
by when I first got to know that, oh, this is actually going to be happening, because


00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:51.980
I do believe that my particular performance will make or break future ideas on whether


00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.860
this should be extended to more people or just closed down altogether.


00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:05.460
So it's not only providing value to the project, it's literally providing proof that this development


00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.340
model works.


00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.520
So yeah, there's certain responsibility around it.


00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.700
I think I already caught a rhythm that I can sustain


00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.160
and I think, you know, kind of splits my own coding


00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.240
with actually reviewing and accepting other contributions,


00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.940
which are the bulk of what I'm doing.


00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.120
Because like, you know, otherwise,


00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.760
if I just focused on coding all week,


00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.060
I might maybe, if I'm lucky and other people review my work,


00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.860
make maybe five, maybe six changes to CPython.


00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.340
we're doing careful reviews because like even simple changes might have actual far-reaching


00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:49.100
consequences. But when I'm reviewing other changes, we sometimes have like 50 or over 50 changes that


00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:56.300
I can actually merge into mainline. So I'm very happy about that. That is obviously a much better


00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:02.140
deal for everybody. - Yeah, it's one of these enabling roles, not just sort of heads down


00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.540
on coding roles, which I think is the important thing.


00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.380
- Absolutely.


00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.100
- Paul Everett out there in the live stream says,


00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.980
you mentioned the stress from the responsibility,


00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.380
agreed, it takes some bravery to do it, kudos.


00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.980
- Oh, thank you.


00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.420
Yeah, like at the same time,


00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.740
I was literally giving talks before about,


00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.820
yeah, we should do this.


00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.820
So, I kind of put myself out there


00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.580
even before this was a position.


00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.900
So at least applying,


00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.060
because like obviously it wasn't at all obvious to anybody,


00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.860
like who is going to be chosen for this.


00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.700
I have this applying was sort of in the cards.


00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.560
Like I had to man up and do it, you know.


00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.940
- Yeah, that's cool.


00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.900
Well, you know, let's start with,


00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.780
let's sort of explore a bit your background.


00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.900
Like it's not just that you are a user of Python.


00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.140
I don't know, even a really good Python developer


00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.100
themselves might not be a good fit for this role


00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.500
because it really is like closely working


00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.120
with people contributing to the code base


00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.660
and the core developers and all that.


00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.920
So, you know, maybe give people a sense


00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.320
of some of the things that you did previously to this


00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.200
in the, it's like, for example, you create a black.


00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.240
I think maybe people have heard of black.


00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.040
- Yeah, if anything, this was actually probably


00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.800
something that made it harder for me to get this position


00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.440
because obviously everybody is scared, like,


00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.920
hey, are you gonna reformat all of this


00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.040
down the library now, like, you know.


00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.200
- Well, you're bringing the black guy.


00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.160
He's gonna totally format it different.


00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.160
- Yeah.


00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.760
- The biggest PR ever.


00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.880
- No, like, so, joking aside,


00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.000
I'm not new in the project,


00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.960
and that was obviously important.


00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.800
It's kind of hard for me to, you know,


00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.800
kind of now enumerate the reasons why I was chosen.


00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.840
Like, you know, kind of,


00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.980
I can only tell you what I told the PSF when I applied,


00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:01.880
because that was actually like the only time in my life where I actually had to write like a proper


00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:07.240
cover letter and actually kind of do some soul searching and say like, "Hey, am I actually


00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.760
a good fit for this?" And I think of that. - What is my mission statement?


00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:19.080
- Exactly. Yeah, pretty much. So I've been around for a while. I've done some changes big and small.


00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.040
There's a bunch of peps with my name on them.


00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:29.960
So I guess it's not just tiny typo fixes and introducing new bugs.


00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.280
It's also introducing peps.


00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.160
Some of them might be more clear-cut wins than others.


00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.600
But yeah.


00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.360
>> You appear in a lot of the peps.


00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.440
You were the release manager as well, right?


00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.000
>> Yes, I still am for 3.9.


00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.560
3.9 is now currently already pretty late in the game in the sense that


00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:55.080
we will be releasing Python 3.9.7 just next Monday. So probably not when, you know,


00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:00.920
the listeners of the podcast are going to, well, like, they're probably going to see this already


00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:06.600
released. But that for now, like for the ones like watching the live stream, yeah, next Monday is when


00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:13.800
we're going to release 3.9.7. So that's already the seventh bug fix release of Python 3.9. There's


00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.800
There's gonna be a bunch of more of those


00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.820
and then it's going to graduate or retire


00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.480
into the mode where only security fixes


00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.680
are considered for inclusion.


00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.000
This is where Python 3.8 is already.


00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.880
I've been managing the releases of that.


00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.200
The coolest features now--


00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.280
- Sorry, how long do you remain the release manager


00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.240
until 3.9 is retired or does it get handed off


00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.480
at some point?


00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.480
No, no, no.


00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.720
You become a release manager for the entirety of a lifecycle


00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.720
of two releases.


00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.680
This was true for a long time.


00:24:53.680 --> 00:25:01.040
I didn't dig up prehistory, but since the Python 3 releases,


00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.720
I looked at that was the case.


00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.160
Python 2.7, I think, was Benjamin.


00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.000
And 2.6, I'm not sure that it was him.


00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.320
It was probably Barry Warsaw.


00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:18.800
But the thing is, 2.7 was the longest release managing job ever.


00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.080
So you could just burn yourself out on that one release.


00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.860
So that's fine.


00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.360
For us currently, we're managing two releases.


00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.720
So how long is that?


00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:35.560
Well, with the development of a given Python version, where 3.11 is already being developed


00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:44.320
right now, it takes around a year and a half for it to actually get out there as the final


00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.320
release.


00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.720
We do have a cadence where we release new versions every year, but that's only because


00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:58.520
once one release becomes beta, we can already switch the branches and now new features go


00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.520
to a yet new version.


00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.520
So currently-


00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.960
I think that happened on your watch, right?


00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.080
happened on your watch, wasn't it 18 months before?


00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:07.580
Yes.


00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:12.480
So 18 months of a cadence was never really a hard calendar


00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.120
event.


00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.000
It was more like a guideline.


00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.920
We're like, yeah, we're going for 18 months.


00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.640
Sometimes it was 19, sometimes it was 20.


00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.400
But it was problematic for many reasons.


00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.720
So yes, one of the peps that I authored


00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.120
was a PEP saying, hey, we should change


00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.480
the cadence of development to make it an annual release


00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.720
cadence which helps with downstream distributors like Linux distributions.


00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.640
And for many other reasons like you know for us like that's in the pep.


00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.640
But yeah like to just close on your original question like it takes around


00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.920
eight years from starting the job to like actually saying oh now I'm a


00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.400
retired release manager.


00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.400
So it's a big commitment isn't it?


00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.600
Yeah wow that's amazing.


00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.440
Well thank you for that.


00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.880
That's that's wild.


00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.420
So when you, you touched on this a little bit,


00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:08.180
but on your original blog post announcing it,


00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.940
which I'll link to in the show notes, of course,


00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.780
you talked about what can one person do


00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.620
as the developer in residence?


00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.060
And you called out a bunch of specific things here


00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.460
about how you can basically be a multiplier effect


00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.940
for people who want to contribute,


00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.140
who are not core developers.


00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.680
Do you want to maybe sort of give us the rundown on those things?


00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.680
Sure.


00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.940
So, like, the blog post, I'm still happy with it because it kind of shows that it wasn't


00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.580
just winging it, like I actually thought it through.


00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:45.060
But like, you know, it lists a bunch of things that are ideas and then you actually start


00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.300
doing the job and some things become clear, right?


00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.040
So like, all of the things I wrote are true.


00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.780
But what I, for example, didn't quite like word out in the blog post that I realized


00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:05.260
is important is that very many changes that I touch are kind of 90% there, where I cannot


00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:11.700
just merge them as is, but really what I need changing is the doc string is just bad or


00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.820
the comment is misleading or whatever.


00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:24.020
So like a bunch of simple things that kind of, it feels just wrong to just review the


00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.740
the change and say, hey, like I request you do this, you know,


00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.660
- This trivial little thing, right?


00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.540
- Because you need to break.


00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.020
- Yeah, you got to do the line break


00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.140
because this code is 90 lines and 90 characters long.


00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.780
Like you could just break that line


00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.340
and then commit it, right?


00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.780
- Yeah, so this is what I do actually very often right now.


00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.460
I just kind of take the change locally, you know,


00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.740
run the tests that, you know, kind of are important


00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.300
for this particular case.


00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.940
I do the change that I would ask for just myself, you know,


00:28:53.940 --> 00:29:00.660
without actually looping in the original author. Most people actually leave that tick on their


00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:06.180
GitHub pull requests making my job easier. So yeah, thanks for that. And then, yeah, maybe-


00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:10.820
I just did a PR last night and I allow maintainer to edit the PR, yes.


00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:16.500
Yes. This is something I'm using very often right now. Because if you forgot to, for example, put


00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:22.820
a news entry for this and you've never done this before, yes, there's a bot for this that Marietta


00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:29.540
I wrote so like you know you just need to go and read how to do this and you will be


00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:34.700
able to do this from now on but you know when will you do that maybe tomorrow maybe in a


00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.820
week maybe you're just gonna leave this pull request you know to go stale so instead I


00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:45.540
just go and do this for you so this kind of level of multiplication really I think is


00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:51.620
kind of you know closing the gap like because very many changes and sometimes it's just


00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:56.160
sad to look at, you know, like you have a change from 2017 that is clearly great,


00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.160
you know, like clearly valuable.


00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:03.160
And then there was some knit that, you know, prevented it from being merged and


00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:08.000
now it's 2021 and it no longer merges because there's conflicts with other


00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.920
unrelated things.


00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.920
It's so out of date.


00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.080
It's no longer just a knit.


00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.600
It's now like a big project.


00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.840
Now it's hard to merge.


00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:19.600
Uh, and obviously not just that, maybe that original person who created the


00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:25.840
change and worked hard on it now is discouraged or moved on to other projects because you know


00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.680
like it wasn't merged for four years so this is what we want to change right we want to make the


00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:37.600
well not just the first-time contributor but like any contributor well life or experience like much


00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:43.600
better by at least providing feedback like not all feedback will be positive like this is already a


00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:49.640
a mature project and sometimes very good and easy ideas actually aren't if you look close


00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.640
enough.


00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:56.860
You know, like this is the frustrating part where even kind of clear-cut advantages might


00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.000
be disadvantages for a different group of users, right?


00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.380
Or on a different platform that you're not a user of, but you know, we have to actually


00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.440
look at the big picture.


00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.360
But at least you're going to know from somebody like me that, hey, like this is good, but


00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.960
We cannot take it because of the X, Y, Z.


00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.720
- It's super frustrating or disappointing


00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.720
to put work into doing a PR, submitting the PR,


00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:27.100
and then it's not that it was rejected.


00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.300
It just gets, it gets no response.


00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.280
And that, you know, that's, I think, really frustrating.


00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.640
Like I spent a whole day 'cause I was thinking


00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.020
this would make this thing, almost works for me,


00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.880
make it perfect for me, and here's the thing.


00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.580
And the answer could be, no, it's not the right direction,


00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.500
but no answer at all is just like,


00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.700
"Ah, I'm not sure I want to do this again."


00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.520
Related to that, Rodrigo out in the live stream


00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.040
has a pretty good question, I think.


00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.580
Let me throw that out to you.


00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.700
What is some of the advice


00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.780
to potential future Drive by contributors?


00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.320
How could they make your life easier?


00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:05.260
- Well, in the future, we'll move to GitHub issues.


00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.640
So a bunch of this will become easier


00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.540
for the contributors themselves.


00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.880
But currently that we still have a bugspython.org,


00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.640
there is a required step pretty much


00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.360
for anything that isn't a trivial typo,


00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.480
which is you need to have a bugspython.org account


00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.360
where we know that you signed the CLA, right?


00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.960
So the contributor license agreement saying,


00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.720
I release my code under Apache, for example, right?


00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.600
So that we can actually use it and merge it and it's fine.


00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.920
So this is something that, you know,


00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.920
kind of is the important original step.


00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.600
And once you're already on bugspython.org


00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.400
and your change is not trivial,


00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.240
please click that open new issue button


00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.360
and write what you're doing and why.


00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.200
Maybe it's already there, maybe you already know


00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.840
that you're fixing a particular thing


00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.640
that was already reported by somebody else.


00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.280
But if not, spend this five to 10 minutes


00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.720
describing what is happening


00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.280
and why you want the change applied.


00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.080
very many changes, simply do the thing that they want to do.


00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.520
Many of them don't even write in the pull request name


00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.360
like what they're doing.


00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.760
It's simply the original GitHub update file,


00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.120
which really is a puzzle now for anybody else


00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.400
because we don't really know why this thing was touched


00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.240
in the first place.


00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.960
So essentially just describe like where you're coming from,


00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.320
like what is this change doing?


00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.480
Like that is already great.


00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.980
that already gives context to us.


00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.820
And in terms of--


00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:39.840
- Would you suggest, sorry,


00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.920
would you suggest that people create an issue


00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.880
and get a little bit of buy-in from you all


00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.920
before actually doing the change and the PR?


00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.960
Like, would it make sense to say,


00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.840
I'm considering this, I'm happy to do a PR,


00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.880
here's the plan.


00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.720
Would you accept this if I did it?


00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.560
Okay.


00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.440
- Because like that is the worst, you know,


00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:04.600
centrist bleak answer that anybody can give depends, right?


00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.760
But it depends.


00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.000
So when you're doing bug fixes,


00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.900
you should just go ahead and do your best


00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:12.920
and make the bug fix.


00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.880
Like, here's the failing test, here's the fix.


00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.920
Yeah, but if you are saying, hey,


00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.920
this library should have this new function


00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.040
that I am using in my own project.


00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.860
So I just wanna put it in, say, func tools or whatever.


00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.400
So before actually going ahead


00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.560
and creating that pull request,


00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.520
Like it probably might sense to discuss it with us


00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.960
because a growing standard library,


00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.960
well, isn't so clear cut a value as you think, right?


00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.720
Because it's a maintenance burden.


00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.640
And more importantly, you know,


00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.000
now it has to consider all the usage groups


00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.240
that the original author might not care about,


00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.200
but we have to, we necessarily have to.


00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.040
So yeah, for features, definitely file an issue,


00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.800
you know, describe your problem.


00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.520
You might actually, if that makes it easier


00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.960
for everybody to discuss, just submit a pull request


00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.200
saying, "Hey, this is the feature


00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.440
"if you wanna talk about it."


00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.800
So we actually talk about something concrete


00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.060
instead of an idea.


00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.500
But if you, for example, say that,


00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.840
"Hey, we need to rewrite multiprocessing


00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.360
"so it does this other thing,"


00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.200
instead of creating a multi-file gigantic pull request,


00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.600
let's discuss first.


00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.080
- Okay, yeah, it makes sense.


00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.220
Another question out there I think is good from Paul is,


00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:33.020
your PR review velocity, do you expect it to go up


00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.860
as you get better and maybe automate


00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.020
or go down as you hit the harder PRs?


00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.860
- Hard to say.


00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.420
- It's like clearing out your inbox a little bit, right?


00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.740
Like some of them are easy, some of them are like,


00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.900
oh, that's a whole day, oh no.


00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.860
- So it is essentially kind of, it is not very easy


00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.420
to kind of foresee what's gonna happen a given week,


00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.900
but one thing for now has been constant.


00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.980
like, I need to get the number of pull requests down,


00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.220
like below the number that we have right now,


00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.540
because there's going to be some that are on page 35


00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.140
of the open pull requests page.


00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.220
So I will probably never get to them otherwise.


00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.540
So I need to bring the number down.


00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.900
And so far, just by myself, I was unable to do it.


00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.620
Like, just I cannot do it.


00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:23.620
Like I said, like, hey, just 40 hour work week be done.


00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.980
like I need to see if I can really bring this number down,


00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:33.460
you know, and I almost merged 100, you know,


00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.940
so that was not something I can do every week.


00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.340
And I still didn't meet the, you know, the goal


00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:43.700
because I did leave the count below 1400


00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.420
when I went to sleep and I, you know,


00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.820
woke up the next day and it was already over, you know.


00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.340
- Yeah, we saw the rate of incoming ones, that's a lot.


00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:56.780
Yes, so I'm doing around 50-ish a week right now.


00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.020
And it sounds super high, but some of them


00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:03.780
are backboards to branches that we maintain.


00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.580
I list those because some of those backboards


00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.580
aren't trivial, right?


00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.220
They will conflict because the file's changed in between.


00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.100
Or they require some push from a person


00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.420
because the bot didn't do what it's supposed to do.


00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.660
So it's also work.


00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.460
But 50 isn't really me kind of flexing.


00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.980
I can do so many changes.


00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:28.340
It's really the rate of change that you can see.


00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.680
So there are enough new changes, right?


00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:38.380
That I guess I can always forever just stay on page one and just deal with those.


00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.860
But that would feel unfair, right?


00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.020
That is some reversal of priorities where the last step comes in.


00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:49.540
You almost need to go to the last page and work your way forward.


00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:56.500
So sometimes I would look at the older ones, basically just asking interesting query to


00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:01.460
the search, pull request search on GitHub and see what's there for, for example, this


00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:08.080
file or what's already approved and that I can kind of maybe push over the line and so


00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.080
on.


00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.420
So there's going to be some balance there.


00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:19.340
I don't expect to go any faster than I currently am because I can't really automate much there.


00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:24.960
There might be some instances where if we analyze the pull requests better, we find


00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.160
that, oh, there's an entire genre of pull requests that we can just bulk close.


00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.160
But I can't really, you know, put this on the report.


00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.840
It's like, oh, I closed 1500 pull requests.


00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.840
I'm so great.


00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:44.840
No, I mean, the ones that I put on the weekly report are all that I, with my own eyes, look


00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.840
at and review.


00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:52.260
So I don't see how automation can really help me do that faster.


00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.420
We need to be careful, right?


00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:01.200
It's still a language used for some important stuff in our industry and beyond.


00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:10.800
So a high rate of change sounds nice, but it also is risky if you don't do it responsibly.


00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:19.480
So I think that the 50-ish number that I'm currently at is enough that I don't feel like


00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.640
I could be doing more.


00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:26.800
No, it's around what I can reasonably, with a clear mind, review day in, day out.


00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.400
And I still have some time to actually code, which is also fun because now you're contributing


00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.160
something of your own.


00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:39.840
But yeah, I don't think I can get to 100 every week, regardless of the automation I can come


00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:45.680
up with. Yeah, and maybe they get harder. Oh yeah, they might. Because you could go,


00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.440
"All right, this one I can quickly close this, I can quickly close this," but as you sort of cycle,


00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:56.240
iterate over that list, like you get stuck more with the hard ones, potentially. Yeah, so you


00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:01.360
mentioned the weekly report. You're doing a weekly report that's just out in public. So for example,


00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:07.920
I'll link in the show notes to your weekly report for July 26 to August 1st. What is this,


00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.560
like your second or third week, something like that?


00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.440
- Yeah.


00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.320
- Yeah.


00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.240
Joey, if people want to keep up with what you're doing,


00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.160
it's right out there, isn't it?


00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.120
- It would be out there anyway, right?


00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.120
Because like, even if you don't look at the reports


00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.280
that I'm writing, like you can still go to my profile


00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.240
on GitHub and just see like what the stream says there.


00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.720
And if it doesn't say anything, like, you know,


00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.520
that's kind of worrying.


00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.360
It's like, hey, is this guy even working?


00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.160
What is he doing?


00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:34.880
(laughing)


00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.520
Sometimes, you know--


00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.600
- Check your Instagram, see if you're on the beach.


00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.920
- Yeah, exactly.


00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.760
And I was actually, just last week.


00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.200
Yes, so the weekly reports are kind of,


00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:49.700
you know, thought of, you know, by me personally,


00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:53.080
since like the PSF wants me to blog about what I'm doing,


00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.480
but not at this cadence, right?


00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.820
But I personally just want to kind of tell you


00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.920
what I'm working on, because ultimately what I'm doing


00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.820
is work on an open source project for the community,


00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.940
like literally hired by the Python Social Foundation.


00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.500
So there is no agenda that is personal to me


00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.100
or driven by some corporation.


00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.260
Like I'm literally maintaining this for you.


00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.560
So like, why not just let you in


00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.460
on what I've spent my time on?


00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.180
Most of those I expect are gonna be pretty boring


00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.420
after a while, 'cause like a big part of it,


00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.700
like at the bottom is always just a list of PR


00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.300
so we can actually click through and see like,


00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.820
oh, what did I do there?


00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.060
But I always try to keep it interesting


00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.080
by finding some highlights


00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.780
that I found particularly interesting on a given week.


00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:43.600
- Yeah.


00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.420
I think this is really valuable.


00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.980
And it'll help people a lot


00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:51.960
to sort of see what the role is doing.


00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.420
So originally this role was based


00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:58.700
on Django's fellowship program, right?


00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.900
- Oh, yes.


00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:00.720
- Yeah, that's really cool.


00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:04.820
you're able to, Django had this idea of bringing on people


00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.060
to help sort of deal with the lower, not lower level,


00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.700
the more maintenance oriented stuff, right?


00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.980
Like exactly what we've been talking about.


00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.460
And I know one of the things you talked about somewhere


00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.300
in one of your articles, I can't remember which,


00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.860
was basically you're very excited about this role,


00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:23.780
but you're also a little nervous


00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.380
'cause you wanna make sure that


00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.900
you're the first one doing it


00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.660
and you wanna make sure that it is going strong


00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.940
for the next year and the year after


00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.420
and whoever comes along, you want,


00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.580
this is a good thing and you want to keep going, right?


00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.140
So that's a little bit,


00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.660
you're kind of breaking the ground there, right?


00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:43.580
- Yes, so this is important for many reasons, obviously,


00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.580
right, because like, you know,


00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.940
we can go ahead and talk about like


00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.300
how this can transform Python


00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.820
if there's enough people doing this full time and whatnot.


00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.980
And this is all true, but you know,


00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:57.420
there are also kind of more like down to earth reasons


00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:02.820
why I would like more people to be able to experience work as I am right now,


00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.460
because it's just a wonderful way to work.


00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:10.500
Not only am I working on something that was my hobby for like a decade now,


00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.100
so I can just day in day out just kind of, you know,


00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:17.100
I feel like I'm just, you know, kind of just doing the hobby right now.


00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.300
So it's amazing.


00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:22.060
But also, and this is something that, you know, like kudos to Google,


00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:29.700
Like the sponsorship level for this is Bay Area level of salary for a software developer.


00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:35.380
So like it doesn't really matter that I am here in Poland, you know, kind of where, you


00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:41.500
know, very many companies would apply some, you know, location specific salaries to a


00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:46.620
position and no, like this is literally kind of the, like, well, like I don't want to say


00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:51.020
premium grade, but like industry strong salary here.


00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:55.820
It's not like you had to go and say, I'm really going to take a hit, but I really want to do this.


00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:56.860
So let's just do it.


00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.020
Right.


00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:57.900
So it's a proper job.


00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:58.780
Not at all.


00:43:58.780 --> 00:43:59.420
Not at all.


00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:04.860
Which is exactly why I think, you know, it's both important to the project, but also important to


00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:09.260
all those people who are already contributing, they already providing value.


00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:17.020
And now if they got paid, like, you know, actual industry strong rates for their work, like this


00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:22.020
this has the opportunity or this has this, well,


00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:28.220
enough value that it can change a person's life, right?


00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:31.700
Like some of our contributors are not in the US


00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.940
or in countries that are like, I don't know,


00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:38.220
Eastern Europe or East Asia or wherever else.


00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.140
And there, this kind of amount of money


00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:46.100
might actually make or break somebody's entire livelihood.


00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.100
So it's amazing that this opportunity exists.


00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:53.980
At the same time, for now, let's not get ahead of ourselves.


00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:58.300
This is a contract for one person for 12 months.


00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.460
It might not get renewed.


00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.940
We might not get a sponsorship for next year.


00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.940
So the PSF might actually have to be on the lookout


00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:12.140
for more sponsors later, or maybe for a new developer


00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:18.140
if they just don't feel like the current one is doing the job well enough.


00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:22.140
So all those things might still be in motion.


00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:27.140
So I myself don't really already put this in the bank.


00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:31.140
I won't be doing this now for however long.


00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:39.140
Now I'm really spending this first year of really producing the most I reasonably can.


00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.600
because it might just be a 12 month gig


00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.940
that I will be having like fond memories of,


00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.560
you know, in a decade,


00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.340
or maybe it's a start of something much bigger.


00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.300
So why not take the chance and just, you know,


00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.640
try your best?


00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.640
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.800
So let's dream just a little bit,


00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.720
and then maybe I'll put a call out to it.


00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.140
Would it make sense?


00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:06.920
Would you want, could you do more with like a team of people


00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.940
if there were five developers in residence,


00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:14.120
what would the PR look like?


00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.140
20 open ones, the oldest one a month open,


00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.880
things like that, like, would that be good?


00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.660
Would you wanna see that?


00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:25.500
- Having five people available for work like this


00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.880
would entirely change how I'm approaching this


00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.860
because currently, like, I don't really have much


00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.800
in terms of coordination with others, right?


00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.400
I just look at whatever current work is happening and try to help out there.


00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.660
But if you had five people, you could actually hit this problem head on.


00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:46.460
We have 1,400 open pull requests.


00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:52.520
It's not a question now, if we get them down to zero, but when?


00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:57.100
Now we actually can plan to do this methodically.


00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:01.340
And a lot of bigger style things that we always wanted to have in Python, we could now just


00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.320
plan to implement ourselves.


00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:09.340
Now if I'm just the only person doing this, it feels irresponsible to just hide somewhere


00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:13.660
in a basement in Poland and start churning out my favorite feature.


00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.180
That's not what this world is about.


00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:19.380
But if you have five people, you can reasonably expect that some of them might actually work


00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:25.740
full time providing new features or finishing unfinished ones, which there are plenty of


00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.220
for inclusion in a future version of Python.


00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.220
of Python.


00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.220
In fact, I'm already--


00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.220
- Right, there could be somebody who says,


00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.580
I'm the one who just goes to all the bug PRs


00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.900
and just checks those,


00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.020
and there could be somebody working on performance,


00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.300
and you could specialize in things like that even.


00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.520
- Oh, specialize, but I really kind of think


00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.620
that if all of them are developers in residence,


00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.460
it would be great if they kind of had


00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:51.980
this on-call rotation for doing things as I'm doing now.


00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:56.540
So just responding to the external community, right?


00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.660
because the important thing that I wrote in the original post


00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:04.340
and I still believe in is the drive-by contributor


00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.180
experience is extremely important.


00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:09.980
So we would always have to have somebody doing this.


00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:12.780
But at the same time, nobody really wants to do only that.


00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.260
Everybody has to provide--


00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.260
well, wants to provide value of their own


00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.180
so that they can touch it and say, yeah, I did this.


00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.740
This is good.


00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:24.140
So yeah, I already have a bit of this,


00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:31.420
not as ClearCut, not sponsored by the PSF directly, but Pablo, the release manager of Python 3.10 and


00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:39.740
3.11 is both sponsored by Bloomberg to work half-time on Python performance and also by him


00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:45.980
doing the release managing job for Python 3.10 and 3.11, he coordinates with me very often right now,


00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:51.500
especially that now we are in the release candidate stage of Python 3.10.0.


00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:58.940
And the greatest thing about this is that he's in London, right? So yeah, maybe far if I were to


00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:04.860
walk to him, but in terms of time zones, that's amazing. Like he's just one hour away. So we mostly


00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:12.140
have very synchronized workdays. So I would talk to him like essentially every day. And that is


00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:19.740
also something that I missed doing remote work before. Because if you are working for a company


00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:25.660
that is in the Bay Area and you're the only one in your time zone, it kind of gets lonely.


00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:33.020
Having more people around that now I have, like Pablo, I have Victor, there's Sergi, Storchaka.


00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:40.380
And most of our communication is async. So it's not like everybody's talking when I'm not around.


00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.900
everything is happening on the mailing list anyway.


00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:48.940
So it feels like I'm much more integrated into the team


00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.420
compared to my previous stints at doing remote work.


00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.740
So I enjoy this a lot.


00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:58.980
So it sounds like it would make a big effect.


00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.340
That's fantastic.


00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.780
You know, and we look at that list of the sponsors,


00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:04.660
the visionary sponsors,


00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.820
and there's three companies doing really good stuff,


00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:11.220
But you gave a implicit sort of call out to this,


00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:12.860
and I've said it plenty of times.


00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.120
There are many companies out there


00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.540
who their entire core of their business


00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:21.020
is built upon Python, and they make billions of dollars.


00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:24.700
Shouldn't they contribute a little,


00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:28.340
consider contributing something to build that foundation


00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.640
a little bit stronger, right?


00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.100
Like maybe make Python a little faster,


00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:36.180
or their developers go a little more efficient or whatever.


00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:42.620
Yes, so like the good thing about this is that, you know, we always can get, you know, can use more money.


00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:44.420
So obviously we need more sponsors.


00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.580
Many of the companies are trying.


00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:59.820
Simply the thing that they need is, you know, some sort of, well, like plan or, well, not like a legal contract, but at least some sort of understanding what the money is going to go for.


00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.100
What do they get out of it, right?


00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:05.460
because in their balance sheets, they have expenses


00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.620
and they have revenue.


00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.100
They don't usually have charity, right?


00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:14.500
It's tricky for them to make it fit.


00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.460
- So I think it's kind of, you know,


00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.460
now with the developer in residence position,


00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:19.860
this kind of changes the game


00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:21.900
because you're no longer just sponsoring


00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.300
the Python Software Foundation and kind of, you know,


00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.880
yeah, you might have expectations,


00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.700
but maybe that will go for PyCon,


00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:30.460
maybe that'll go for sponsoring of events


00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.860
or minority groups or whatever else.


00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:36.300
If your company really is interested in providing


00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:40.540
support to the core development, now you can.


00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:44.060
And I think, well, hopefully, that is my hope,


00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:48.660
we're gonna see more sponsors of that kind of work.


00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.700
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.220
People who are actually interested


00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:55.800
can go to python.org/sponsor/application.


00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.500
And it shows you what the tiers are,


00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.540
what they cost, what you get.


00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:02.920
You get a lot of inside access and a lot of visibility


00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.420
into Python at the visionary level


00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:05.780
that otherwise you wouldn't get.


00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.380
So there's something to be said for that.


00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:13.460
People should check that out, right?


00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:14.860
You get to meet with the PSF board.


00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:20.380
Yeah, a lot of cool stuff there.


00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:22.300
Workshops, job fairs.


00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:27.420
I think there's a lot of things on here that could go down


00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.060
as this is a legit value.


00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:33.200
get a meet with the Python steering council, the sprint


00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.460
recognition, and so on.


00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:38.620
So I just want to encourage companies out there.


00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.900
We don't need tons of them.


00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.340
If we had four others, you said that would


00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.700
make a huge difference, right?


00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:44.540
Absolutely.


00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.540
And also, let's be clear.


00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:53.220
If a sponsor of a developer in the residence job


00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:56.060
came in with a laundry list of this is the things


00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.300
that I want you to do, we'd probably


00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:02.420
have to come to an understanding that this is not


00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:03.540
what this is about.


00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:09.460
But if people who happen to be employees of a company


00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:11.980
come in with changes that make sense


00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.140
and actually provide value for us,


00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:17.780
and now we have people to do full-time code review


00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.300
and inclusion of those changes, it's


00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.380
more likely that things that you care about


00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:23.860
are going to be included.


00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:30.200
So it's, you know, kind of, you can be ethical and impartial to, you know, kind of, well,


00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:35.980
forces of, you know, money flowing into your account, like, and also provide value to the


00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:36.980
sponsor, right?


00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:43.940
Like it's not a zero-sum game, like, you know, so like, let that be clear and explicitly


00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:48.460
said because, you know, kind of, I feel like this is also important to know that if, for


00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:54.620
For example, there is a company that really, really focuses on an operating system like


00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:58.940
Adafruit running everything on Windows or macOS, right?


00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:03.420
Like, you know, and now they're like, "Hey, like we really need somebody to make async


00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:09.140
IO work better on Windows or we need to fix this fork problem on macOS once and for all


00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:10.140
or whatnot."


00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:14.020
Like, you know, if they provide, you know, some changes and now there's people to do


00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:17.980
the review, more likely than not, we're going to have better support for Windows and Mac


00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:19.980
Like, you know, everybody wins.


00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.480
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.480
Another benefit I'll throw out there,


00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.480
just thinking about this is a lot of companies


00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.740
have like continuing education programs and credits.


00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.560
Like, hey, you have a bachelor's degree.


00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.200
Do you want a master's degree?


00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.520
If you're willing to go to school outside of work,


00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.700
we'll provide that for you.


00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:40.120
And the reason is now you have people who work for you


00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.200
that have master's degrees


00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.500
and not bachelor degrees, right?


00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.120
So this could be a similar thing.


00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:52.680
thing like hey we want to provide a position for people to come work as the


00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:57.640
dir or part of the dir and then maybe they come back and work for us afterwards


00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:01.080
but they would be so much more knowledgeable about Python having spent


00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:06.280
a year in this role right I mean there's a lot of benefits like this you it's it's


00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:11.040
you know you won't believe this but like obviously the project is a million


00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:17.940
lines of code, right? Like half of it is in C, half of it is in Python. So I don't know


00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:23.720
about most of it, right? Like I've seen much of it, but like I probably don't have expertise


00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:28.880
in most of it. But like nobody cares when they submit pull requests. So then I look


00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:34.360
at them. So for many of them, it's my first actual stint at, you know, like touching a


00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:40.160
part of Python that I might know as a user, you know, from the outside, right? Yes. But


00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:47.060
But then looking at like, oh, how does dunder main actually work in Python is this special


00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:51.380
module that, you know, like your execution starts with, like, how does this actually


00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.380
work?


00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.960
So you go and see and you actually kind of dig and you understand like, ah, okay, like,


00:55:55.960 --> 00:56:01.000
I understand this because you have to take into account, you know, starting your Python


00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.280
interpreter like, you know, with, I don't know, code from the standard input, or maybe


00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:11.000
somebody is starting a REPL or maybe you're from a file or maybe it's a zip file or whatever.


00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.680
So now I know more than I just knew like two weeks back about Dunder main. So very true.


00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:23.000
Like you bring somebody in who is motivated and maybe knows a bit about what CPython already


00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:29.040
is built on, but necessarily you're going to get experience in parts that you would


00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:33.640
otherwise not touch, right? Because now you're reviewing the bulk of pull requests that are


00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.440
not the ones that you would write yourself.


00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.280
- Yep, absolutely.


00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.640
I remember one listener sent me a message


00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.440
and said, "I was really surprised to hear you say


00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:44.400
"there's like this whole section of the standard library


00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.400
"you didn't know about."


00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.480
That describes a lot of,


00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.120
there's a lot of stuff out there, right?


00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.320
You might just barely touch it,


00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.600
you might have no use for it.


00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.280
There's a lot.


00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.800
And this would force you to just get that depth.


00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.120
- It's big, it's big.


00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.560
- Absolutely.


00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:06.960
So Rodrigo asked previously about what Drive-By contributors can do to help you.


00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:12.460
What can, you know, this is speaking to a smaller audience, of course, but still, I think it's relevant.


00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:20.060
What can the core developers and the steering council and the people on the inside do to help you be more successful and efficient?


00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:23.860
Well, most of them know me.


00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:30.660
So the most important thing for them, and I really mean it, is like, just tell me what I should be rather doing.


00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:34.640
doing if you feel like there's something else I should be touching on or if I did


00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.760
something that you don't like for any reason just write me just tell me right


00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:42.280
like because like it's different from the external contributors most of the


00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:47.720
core devs I know one way or another so we can be direct with one another and I


00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:52.740
think like the make or break of this position is for me to provide value for


00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:57.920
both groups so if there's anything that a particular person that needs or wants


00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:03.120
or even feels like, "Hey, you're focusing too much on this thing," or, "Oh, have you looked at this?


00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:07.200
This is not something you've touched yet, but this is extremely important. Just let me know."


00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:13.280
So, communication is key for us right now. And another thing that I kind of still don't


00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:21.200
quite know how to tackle is that I don't feel comfortable just now assigning a bunch of things


00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:26.400
to volunteers. You know what I mean? It's like now there is a bunch of pull requests where


00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:31.040
they're fixing something that actually broke because of a change that some core developer


00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:37.760
did five years back. So of course they have the best context on this change but I feel kind of


00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:44.160
icky just you know going and doing this 10 times a day you know because it really feels like now


00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:49.040
you're being this manager of Python telling people hey go fix your shit like no that is not what I


00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:54.880
mean? It's like, you know, as I said, the project is huge. And, you know, very often,


00:58:54.880 --> 00:59:02.560
it is really a bunch of people like, like a low number of people who have the best context on a


00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:10.240
given part of Python. So yeah, like, if I do this too much, like, you know, again, like, you know,


00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:15.280
tell me if I'm not doing this, and instead of going ahead and doing changes, you know, that


00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.960
that you don't like in your particular favorite


00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.800
piece of Python, also let me know.


00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.840
Like, this is still something I'm pretty new at.


00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.880
Like, I'm just going to issue my second invoice


00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.200
like next week, I'm pretty excited about that.


00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:32.800
But you know, like, it's still a new thing for me.


00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:36.200
So I guess, you know, for the core devs, yeah, let's talk.


00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:39.200
Like, whenever something is, you know, clearly,


00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:42.600
well, improvable, if that's a word, like, let me know.


00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.320
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.840
How much input into this role did the steering council have


00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.960
and how much did Guido have?


00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.480
Or was this a PSF plus Google sort of thing?


00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:58.240
- So I actually spoke with nobody from Google.


00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:02.740
So directly, I don't know the people behind this position,


01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.800
like on their side.


01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.400
I know a bunch of core devs who happen to work at Google


01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.000
and they're very supportive of the position.


01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.700
So that's the extent of it.


01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.720
The steering council meets with me every second week.


01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.840
So it's mostly kind of me talking,


01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.120
hey, this is what I spend my time on.


01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.920
You know, they ask me like, hey, how can we,


01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.280
well, improve your output or whatever,


01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.440
or just they would just tell me about things


01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.080
that they find interesting or important


01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.160
that I might look at,


01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.360
but it doesn't feel like they're really kind of going


01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.080
and telling me what I should be doing,


01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.440
like, you know, point blank, right?


01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.240
like they're just having like suggestions on


01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.960
and how this role should be moving.


01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.600
So this is kind of, this is a short,


01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.400
well, 20, 30 minute meeting every two weeks.


01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.480
So kind of high level.


01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.480
I do have one just like it with Eva from the PSF and E.


01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:02.720
So it's really, you know, kind of the Python Foundation


01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.200
internally also needs to communicate


01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.200
because they have all the keys to say,


01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.800
being able to restart a bot, right?


01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.220
Or to, you know, kind of make changes on a given server


01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.680
or maybe change some workflow on GitHub


01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.060
that affects everybody and so on and so on.


01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:22.400
So we just also meet every second week


01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.360
to make sure everybody's on the same page.


01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.440
And also just some very low level stuff,


01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.800
like for example, figuring out like,


01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:30.760
hey, what calendar am I working on?


01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.760
Like is Labor Day a day off for me?


01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.240
or is some other holiday that is here in Poland,


01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.720
but not in the US, are they off for me?


01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.080
Or don't I get any day off at all


01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.040
and I work on Christmas day, I don't know.


01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:50.000
So all of those things have to be actually discussed


01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.480
with the PSF directly.


01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.660
Yeah, and core devs, we do talk a lot.


01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:01.400
And Guido in particular was very supportive


01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.560
of me starting this role.


01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.440
So I'm very grateful for this


01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.740
because it's kind of like, you know,


01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:08.880
kind of just getting a little bit of, you know,


01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.320
like an email, just a bunch of sentences,


01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.920
just actually kind of saying like,


01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.040
"Hey, I believe this is a great decision.


01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.880
You're gonna do great."


01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.800
Like, okay, I don't know.


01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.140
Like, I still feel like I'm a beginner in a lot of this.


01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.440
It's really reassuring and kind of lifts your spirit.


01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.900
So, yeah, like I guess we are in constant contact


01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.840
using super old ways like email and, well,


01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.040
discourse to an extent.


01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.120
And now, like, VCs.


01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.880
So yeah, like, we're doing Google Meets and Zooms


01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.880
with others.


01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.440
Actually, we have too many, well,


01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.840
communication methods right now.


01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.720
So like, me talking with core devs,


01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.400
I'm on IRC right now so that others can actually reach me


01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.640
as well.


01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.040
Others would talk to me through WhatsApp and whatnot.


01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.840
Like, I have like 10 chat message apps right now open


01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.400
just to be able to talk to everybody I need to talk to.


01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.840
So that needs fixing, but I don't know


01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.240
who is supposed to do that.


01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.340
- Yeah, I don't either.


01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:11.240
It's a growing problem, not a shrinking one.


01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.040
But it sounds like you're doing a good job.


01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.120
Even Rodrigo out there in the live stream says,


01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.000
"Listen to this, hypes me up to go and contribute to Python."


01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.580
So hopefully that sentiment is multiplied


01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:24.000
across all the people who are contributing work


01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.240
that it'll get more attention sooner.


01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.900
So well done.


01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.280
- Absolutely, I'm happy to hear that.


01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.200
- Yeah, absolutely.


01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.920
All right, well, we're about out of time


01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.380
to talk about the new role.


01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.400
So let me ask you the two final questions,


01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.440
which I've asked you before,


01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.220
but it's been a while since you were on the show,


01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:41.640
so time for an update.


01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.000
If you're gonna do some Python,


01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.840
you know, you always run across different external packages,


01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.340
things on PyPI and whatnot.


01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.740
Have you found one that you're just like,


01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:53.960
"Wow, this thing is amazing.


01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.200
"We should talk about it, get more awareness of it."


01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.720
- So it's already growing,


01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.720
So I'm not going to tell anything that is now extremely novel,


01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.360
but I'm extremely digging rich,


01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.040
like the text formatting library for CLIs.


01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.960
Anything that we write would use their progress bars and


01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:20.680
a bunch of other stuff that's there for column formatting and whatnot.


01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.880
I find it very approachable and the results are like,


01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880
yeah, this is a console,


01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.760
this is a text console just to be clear.


01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.680
It just looks fantastic.


01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.560
>> It's insane.


01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.000
>> The code for it is very nice.


01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.520
It's very declarative.


01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.760
Rich, I like a lot.


01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.680
Will, the author of it,


01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.880
is now working on a text UI library that is much more


01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.400
Pythonic than the previous propositions that we had,


01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:51.800
say, like Curses or Uruid.


01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.760
I'm hyped for that as well.


01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.480
It's called Textual.


01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.320
>> Yeah, Textual looks really interesting.


01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.320
- Yeah, absolutely. - Exactly.


01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:04.200
Yeah, those would be my easy propositions for the day


01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.800
in terms of third-party packages.


01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.640
Cool.


01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.720
One that I actually thought of, Rich, earlier


01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.880
when you talked about the better error messages,


01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.400
there's a cool article called


01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.760
"FastAPI Enriched Tracebacks in Development"


01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.480
that talks about how to take Rich and then plug it in


01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.560
so whenever there's a stack trace,


01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.640
you get super colorized error messages


01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.880
and all sorts of cool stuff.


01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.160
And yeah, pretty neat.


01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.080
Pretty neat there.


01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.500
- This changes a lot actually,


01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.160
because I find that, for example,


01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.040
between using GCC, the C compiler,


01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:44.040
and using Clang, just the fact that it colors my errors,


01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:49.680
tiny thing, but it makes Clang just feel nicer to me


01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.600
because it just values my time.


01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:55.360
It just makes it easier for me to read


01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.140
the relevant parts of the message.


01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.880
This sort of thing might just feel like,


01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.460
this is not really that important in my app,


01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:05.600
but it might save you a lot of time later on when you're


01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.760
actually debugging stack traces that


01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.200
you're looking at like at 2 AM or whatnot.


01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.920
I think this is extremely important,


01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.840
not just because it's aesthetically pleasing,


01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.800
which is important in itself,


01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.240
but also functionally.


01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.900
This is the reason we are using syntax highlighting,


01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.400
because it actually lets you see


01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.920
more information at the same time, right?


01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:32.200
So absolutely, like Rich provides this in a very smart way,


01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.720
like to your application,


01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.100
so not just your Python stack traces,


01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.480
but whatever you're displaying might be like this.


01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:42.180
It will automatically format numbers,


01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:45.120
it will automatically highlight dates and


01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.980
file paths and whatnot and whatnot.


01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:52.680
So tremendous value added.


01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.680
>> Yeah, tables, all kinds of cool stuff.


01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.920
Yeah, it's definitely getting a lot of love out there.


01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.220
Then if you're going to write some Python code,


01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:03.760
what editor are you supporting these days?


01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.620
>> I am deeply invested in VS Code right now because it is in


01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.480
a very peculiar position where it's actually very good for


01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.000
CPython development and core development because it's


01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.860
both a good C editor with


01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:20.000
support for just jumping through definitions and whatnot,


01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.760
and also has a great Python plugin, like PyLens.


01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.800
So it's both a type checker and


01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.920
this language server that does a lot of help for you specifically.


01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.080
So it's just a good package all around,


01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.200
like to just do CPython core development.


01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.920
Is it my perfect editor?


01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.920
Well, almost. If the Vim plugin for it was official,


01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.560
officially maintained, and a little more sturdy,


01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.760
I would be the happiest person there.


01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:56.040
But well, clearly this is a super low key feature, like it's not a very popular thing.


01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:01.680
Must not be because otherwise, you know, like looking at what Microsoft is now doing with GitHub and whatnot,


01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.360
like that would have been implemented if more people asked for it.


01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.760
So I might be of a dying breed of Vim users, I don't know.


01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:16.280
Still, like gets the job done like with the current Vim plugin and system, like, you know, with Windows splits and whatnot.


01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.440
I'm very happy with it.


01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.840
And now seeing that my development environment can actually be run in a browser,


01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.840
like, what else could you ask for? It's pretty amazing.


01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.680
- Yeah, exactly. You're doing your podcast live stream,


01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:32.640
recording from a browser, and you're editing in a browser, apparently.


01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:37.600
All right, Lucas, well, it's been great to have you here.


01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.120
Final call to action, you know, people want to learn more about the DIR,


01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.720
maybe want to help you out or consider sponsoring this in the future or more people.


01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.720
What do you say?


01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.720
- Well, first of all, if you are a Python user,


01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:56.720
you are very, very welcome to bring issues to us


01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.720
when they happen.


01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.720
So whether this is on bugspython.org,


01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.720
obviously a very good place so that your report


01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:07.720
will historically maintain there,


01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.720
and we can have a discussion that is open


01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.720
and actually work towards a solution.


01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.720
But also in informal ways.


01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:19.720
If you reach to us via RSC or ask stuff on the mailing list or discourse,


01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.420
we're very happy to hear your feedback.


01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:26.820
So you don't have to write code like on day one, don't worry.


01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:29.520
You might never write code for us to fix your problems.


01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.820
Just report them. It's great.


01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:34.220
If you have stuff that works very well for you,


01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.520
you might also spend a minute telling us


01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.520
because this is something that nobody gets enough in this industry.


01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.320
We only get bug reports, you know?


01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:46.800
And yeah, like if you do want to contribute,


01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.900
there's many ways to do this.


01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:51.500
If you want to code, absolutely.


01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.980
Just don't think it's super, super trivial


01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:57.020
to get large changes into a 30 year old


01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:57.980
programming language.


01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.300
I could make an entire talk just about that.


01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:04.420
- Right, every little change has huge implications


01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:06.900
for some small percentage of people,


01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:07.740
but there's millions.


01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:10.100
- Sometimes very surprising ones, yes.


01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.220
But yes, absolutely we need more people doing the work


01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.700
and there's plenty of it.


01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:18.980
So you might still have a tremendous impact for the world.


01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:22.340
Maybe your code is going to run on Mars, you never know.


01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.500
- Yeah, even if you're just reviewing PRs


01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:28.340
and making the little tiny fixes or stuff like that,


01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.580
that could be a big contribution.


01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:33.820
- Totally, and finally for the current sponsors, thank you.


01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:37.900
You make this possible, so like really, thank you.


01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.540
and for people and companies


01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:43.540
considering sponsorship for next year.


01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:45.620
If there's anything that you're not seeing


01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:46.840
that you would like to see


01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.980
that would convince you that it's worth it,


01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.980
also let the PSF know.


01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.780
Like we might adjust what we're doing


01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.780
so that you're more comfortable with sponsoring.


01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.300
Because really, like, you know,


01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:00.140
this is a very unique programming language


01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:04.420
in the sense that it is community driven and community owned.


01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:06.560
So yeah, please talk to us.


01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:07.780
- Yeah, awesome.


01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:09.460
Well, thanks so much for being here.


01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.060
Catch you next time.


01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.140
- Thank you, bye bye.


01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:22.140
