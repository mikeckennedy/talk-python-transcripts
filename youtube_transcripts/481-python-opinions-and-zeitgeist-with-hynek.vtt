WEBVTT

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.640
Henick, welcome back to Talk By The Enemy. Good to see you, man.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.580
Thanks for having me.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.420
Yeah, it's great to have you back on the show.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.940
I've been enjoying a lot of your articles and your videos lately,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.480
and I thought, you know what?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.820
Maybe we should just get together and have an opinion piece by Henick.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.880
I can do opinions.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.320
Yeah, yeah, I know. You're great, Adam.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.120
And so we're going to talk about a whole bunch of different things,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.060
a lot of the things that you've been talking about.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.800
I'm also super interested in some cool articles you've written on Docker,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.660
UV. Last time you were on, we talked about running in production,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.060
and maybe we can review that a little bit and just get some of your takes

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.100
to see what's changed and what's still the same over the last couple of years.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.920
But all those things are awesome.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.620
We're going to talk about some of your open source projects.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.560
It's going to be a journey. It's going to be fun.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.920
Now, before we jump into all that, it's been a couple of years

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.960
since people heard you on the show.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.820
Just a quick background about who you are.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.340
All right.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.900
My name is Henick.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.300
I usually just go by my first name because it's already overwhelming

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.300
to most people to pronounce that one correctly.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.940
Hi, Brian.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.040
My last name is Slavak.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.800
There's really not a lot of Henicks around,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.520
so I just stick to the first name.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.080
As you can hear, I'm a Czech living in Germany.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.000
I live in Berlin,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.200
and I work for a rather small web hosting company

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.780
in the main restaurant called Vario Media.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.960
You probably haven't heard of us unless you speak German

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.820
because we only serve the German-speaking market.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.820
We do speak English, but our stuff is in German.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.220
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.360
And, yeah, I would say you would call it individual contributor there,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.160
so we don't have managers, so everybody is.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.060
And since we are rather small,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.040
stability is the key thing when I'm building systems,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.920
and that informs a lot of my opinions

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.860
that you will probably hear today from me.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.360
Also, I like traveling,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.840
and I don't want to be paged in the middle of my vacation

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.560
and I'm having margaritas on a beach.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.460
Yeah, nobody wants to have to put down the margarita

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.320
because someone took down the server now.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.260
Also, I'm sure we're going to speak a lot more about that,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.200
but nowadays I'm also a YouTuber,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.800
so that's very exciting.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.680
And thanks for the shout-out in the last Python Bytes.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.120
I really appreciated it.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.140
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.060
You're very welcome.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.640
Awesome.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.040
And I think it's interesting to have people who work on small teams,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.000
especially smaller companies,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.080
because that's the common theme of what people do.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.240
I don't have it pulled up right now,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.860
but if you go to the PSF survey

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.780
and you look at some of the demographic stuff,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.120
it'll say, well, what size of a team do you work on?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.640
Is it one person, two to five, 500 to 1,000?

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.240
The vast majority is the two to 10 different people.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.840
It's not Google, Facebook, Microsoft, right?

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.180
So a lot of the advice that comes from these huge places

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.360
is just, I don't know, it's not super relevant.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.180
Yeah, people adopt it.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.440
I call it Google cosplay,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.580
and I feel like my opinions about this whole production thing

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.300
are informed by my distinct dislike for these kind of things

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.780
where just some big tech influencers having opinions on stage

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.380
and everybody wants to mimic it,

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.740
and it just doesn't make any sense.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.360
Because as you said, the long tail is huge.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.240
Most people work for small companies.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.320
It's just like that.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.940
Yeah, and so the things you should do,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.160
they're just different.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.100
And no disrespect to those companies,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.040
and they have a lot of employees,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.820
but in the general population,

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.440
it's a very small group of people

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.280
who have hyperscaling clouds and whatnot

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.940
that they're worried about, right?

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.040
Yeah.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.120
Awesome.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.900
All right, well, you know what?

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.880
I think I want to start this conversation off here

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.980
by talking about some of the articles you've written.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.280
So I think this one's interesting.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.660
Let's talk about virtual environments.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.000
Yeah.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.240
Yeah?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.820
Love them.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.180
I do too.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.860
And you wrote this article called

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.460
Why I Still Use Python Virtual Environments in Docker.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.080
And I do as well.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.980
And when I didn't use Docker,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.840
I had them on my server as well.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.380
And I feel like they're a really interesting,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.900
predictable way to package Python.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.480
And you hear about them, obviously,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.040
oh, well, you're going to create a virtual environment

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.080
so you can have multiple projects

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.600
in your computer and so on.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.560
But Docker, there's only one app running.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.340
What's the deal with these virtual environments in Docker?

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.980
Yeah, I mean, you just said it, right?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.580
It's a lot more predictable in its behavior.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.440
It's a technology that we use everywhere too.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.880
And I just understand what this directory is doing, right?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.420
And I find it very important

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.380
that when I just go on a server or in a Docker container,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.200
I know what a file is doing

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.260
or how things interact with each other.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.720
And I don't have to hunt them down somewhere else.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.760
Or another popular thing is that I write in the first paragraph

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.620
is that people use pipinstore user

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.120
and then set the Python user base directory.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.480
And sure, you can do all these things,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.420
but why would you, right?

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.040
Like, what are you gaining?

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.780
And it's a lot of vibes.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.580
And I admit it in the article too,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.720
but I just find it easier to reason about.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.760
And not everything...

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.580
We don't use only things we need, right?

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.060
Like, we use affordances in other places too.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.320
So why not this as an abstraction

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.680
over an application artifact

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.320
because we don't have anything better in Python.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.900
Yeah, and also one of the things

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.400
that you point out in your article

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.460
that I think is really nice,

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.660
that's already the way you're working on your computer, right?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.820
And so when you go to your Docker container,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.680
it's the same.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.080
You don't have to think about,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.680
well, if it's misbehaving in production,

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.600
that's because, well,

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.640
maybe we've changed the Python path

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.580
or, you know, whatever, right?

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.060
It's exactly the same

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.380
as everyone else is working with.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.680
Yeah, we forgot to set an environment variable.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.100
Oh, no.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.160
Nothing works now.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.920
Exactly.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.420
Oh, boy.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.280
That's been interesting.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.140
So, you know, what's your...

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.100
Let's talk about Docker just a little bit as well.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.660
I think that alone is a pretty interesting choice.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.900
You said you work on smaller teams

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.700
and maybe web hosting companies

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.740
give this a little bit of a plus-plus slant

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.760
on Docker or not.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.820
But Docker, no Docker, right?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.720
A lot of people, I think, see containers

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.760
and they think complexity

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.760
and they think it's hard to debug.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.440
Like, if something goes wrong in the container,

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.020
it's just, it's opaque to me.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.120
What would you say to people

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.300
that feel like containers are too complicated?

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.560
Obviously, the answer is, as always, it depends, right?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.140
It's a trade-off like everything else.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.820
Like, we don't give Docker to our customers.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.940
Like, our customers, we sell mostly LAMP,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.840
like, mostly WordPress,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.880
which is very interesting these days.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.620
Oh, my gosh.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.300
I don't know if we want to go down that one,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.240
but it is super, super turmoil right now.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.600
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.140
No, we don't.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.880
Let's talk about it.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.840
Matt doesn't know we exist.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.280
It's fine.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.540
Yeah, so you're trading off the things you just said,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.620
like the debuggability and everything

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.500
against development of velocity

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.720
and reproducibility.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.600
So we, for example,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.580
we don't run Kubernetes

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.340
because it's just too complex for us to run,

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.060
and we run everything on-premise.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.560
So, like, we do not have anything,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.180
we do not use any external services whatsoever.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.340
Wow, okay.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:15.960
Right.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.260
So everything runs into our own data centers.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.220
So we are European,

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.520
so some of the things we do,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.440
other things we do

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.900
because Germans like it that way.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.620
We can say, like,

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.660
our data center is right there.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.420
You can look at it.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.060
No data leaves it.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.720
Yeah, if you have to,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.140
I can come look at my code

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.760
through the little rack window.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.620
There it is.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.800
You can try around inside

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.680
and see how fast you get tasered by the security.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.020
It's all good.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:47.640
But we use quite a bit of HashiCorp software.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.620
So we had Consul and Vault before

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.560
for configuration,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.100
service discovery, and secrets.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.500
So we use Nomad

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.820
because it was a logical add-on

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.160
to run our applications.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.480
So, like,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.880
that's where most of our web applications run.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.900
Like, everything that can run in containers

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.760
usually runs in our Nomad cluster

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.500
in Docker containers.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.800
And, yeah,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.540
sometimes there are a bit of a pain

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.520
to debug,

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.080
but you can SSH

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.420
into a Docker container, right?

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.320
So, yeah.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.180
And I, like,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.120
first hot tip of the day,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.280
there's this thing called BusyBox,

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.820
which is, like, one command.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.700
And depending on what name you call it,

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.440
it's something different.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.700
And it's just,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.240
yeah,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:34.880
it's just very,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.040
very few bytes.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.480
Like,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.420
you can look at it,

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.660
and it's static.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.540
it gives me things like ping,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.520
and I think

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.800
trace root is in there, too.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.460
So I can do, like,

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:46.740
all these,

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.300
yeah,

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.740
I can do all these basic things

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.060
in those containers, too.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.700
So it's not like

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.160
it's a completely black box.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.280
You can SSH into them.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.900
It's no problem.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.200
A couple thoughts.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.700
One,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.540
I agree with you on.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.000
One more thing.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.400
One more thing.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:00.960
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.480
We do not run SSH clients

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.460
on those Docker containers.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.660
So this is an affordance

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.620
that we get from Nomad,

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.360
and I'm sure other

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.060
cluster managers

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.640
have that, too,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.800
that they allow you

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.520
to enter containers

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.480
from the outside.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:15.880
So, like,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.520
you SSH into the host,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.100
and that,

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.520
from there,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.480
you get into the container.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.100
Right.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.700
Yeah, I do that,

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.020
as well,

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.420
on my stuff.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.160
I've recently moved

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.160
a couple,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
maybe a year or two ago,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:31.720
to running,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.040
I used to have

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.340
a bunch of smaller servers.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.340
I don't know,

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.160
maybe I bought into

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.100
the cloud computing

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.820
as a bunch of commodity boxes,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.820
and you can just make

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.640
a bunch of little ones,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.740
and that's the way you do it.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.580
And eventually,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.300
I'm just like,

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.740
you know what?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.680
I'm tired of dealing

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.360
with all these servers.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.940
Putting them all in one thing,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.060
running everything,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:50.460
Docker,

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.240
keeping it isolated.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.640
And it's been really excellent,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.480
so similar access model there.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.120
I'm not sure this makes sense

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.180
for you guys,

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.440
but I think for folks

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.760
who maybe expected still

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.180
to SSH into their server

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.420
and mess with it,

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:08.940
you know,

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.840
maybe this doesn't make sense

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.580
for your customers,

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.420
but maybe it does

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.900
for you guys individually,

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.700
behind the scenes,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.160
is I like to have

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.440
a couple of tools,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:19.980
a little bit,

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.540
like you were saying

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.120
with BusyBox,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.820
already installed

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.700
in my Docker container,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.780
so if I need to get into it

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.000
and ask it questions,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.020
I can actually,

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.320
you know,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:30.960
log in

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.700
through some sort

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.400
of Docker exec,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.320
you know,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.120
Docker exec,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.720
dash IT,

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.800
sort of ZSH,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.600
or bash,

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:37.900
or whatever,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.320
and ask it questions.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.280
What are your thoughts?

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:41.640
Do you think

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.020
if you put something like,

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:43.900
oh, my Z shell,

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.380
so you have better

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:44.960
command history

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.600
while you're poking around,

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.260
is that sacrilegious

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.980
in a Docker container,

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.020
or how do you feel

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.440
about this?

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.920
You're asking me

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.680
if you have a fan siege.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.120
Well,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.240
we are sacrilegious

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:55.980
in a different way,

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.280
like our normal servers

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.040
that we access H2,

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.360
we run fish on them,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.140
because most of us

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:00.640
like fish.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.480
Yeah, sure.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.600
So we have very nice

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.880
fish prompts running there,

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.200
and everybody who claims

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.160
they have to use bash

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.760
on their notebooks

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.960
because they have to

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.800
access H2 servers,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.820
look at us,

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.580
it's fine.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.840
You can do whatever you want,

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.920
it's your servers, man.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.080
I'm with you.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.280
I don't have

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.120
the strong opinions,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.640
because like,

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.200
as I said,

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200
we run everything on-prem,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.020
so we have our own

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.580
Docker registry,

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.360
so I'm not losing sleep

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.180
over how big

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.220
my containers are.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.080
Yes.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.840
Like, obviously,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.960
I try to keep

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.180
the surface small,

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:30.640
because like,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.580
everything you install

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.260
can probably be misused

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.040
in some way,

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.420
can be a problem,

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.320
like XZ, for example,

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:37.580
right?

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.100
Right.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.760
Like, things can be dangerous,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.740
but I mean,

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.060
if it helps you

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.940
to get things done,

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:44.620
whatever, right?

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.560
Yeah.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.660
When you hear

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.580
the security folks

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.080
talk about living

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.880
off the land,

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.800
that's what they mean.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.200
They're like,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.600
oh, I somehow

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.660
got into this machine,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.960
and it turns out

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.400
that this tool

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:57.940
that I needed

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.400
to access the database

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.340
was just laying here,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.740
and off it goes,

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:01.920
right?

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.620
They didn't have to get

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.600
anything on the server.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.600
So that,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.020
in a sense,

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.920
you kind of want to eliminate.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.340
I do think the trade-off

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.200
is are you pushing

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.100
to a Docker registry

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.780
and shipping

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.940
the thing all around,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.000
or is it just being built

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.500
in some local-ish

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.520
story, right?

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.540
Interesting.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.000
Okay.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.160
So,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.880
the reason

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.760
that I found out

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.340
about your article,

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:33.520
your virtual environment article,

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.460
is I was actually

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.060
looking around

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.120
at your UV article,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.860
because,

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.760
wow,

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.340
does UV speed up Docker builds?

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.520
Oh, yeah.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.120
Oh, yeah.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.460
So,

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.420
Jay Miller made a comment

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:49.980
just yesterday,

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.320
I saw,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.920
that was pretty funny.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.240
He said,

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.820
UV is the new AI,

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.280
and I suppose AI

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.600
is the new blockchain.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.020
Like,

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.620
everyone's excited about it.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.000
There's some

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.840
minor level

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.500
of controversy

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.120
about it,

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:03.880
but,

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.360
I don't know.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.360
I'm a big fan.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.020
What are your thoughts

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.060
on UV these days?

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.020
First of all,

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.080
for people who don't know,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.180
we're talking a lot

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.040
of two-letter acronyms.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.020
You said XZ earlier,

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:13.600
now UV.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.220
Forget XZ,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:15.700
that was bad,

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.800
but what's UV?

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.660
Well,

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.920
UV is

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.680
re-implementation

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.200
of Python packaging

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.700
in Rust,

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.680
roughly saying,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:24.960
right?

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.880
In Rust.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.020
Yeah.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:26.600
Yes, Rust.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.860
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.480
And they started

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.240
at the bottom,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.940
they implemented

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.920
UV pip

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.080
to replace pip.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:33.880
UV env

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.100
to re-implement

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:35.740
virtual env,

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.360
and UV pip compile,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:38.860
I think,

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.580
was the thing,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.100
to do our good

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.980
old requirements

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.040
of TXT files,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:44.760
and they did it

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.380
very fast.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.100
And already back then,

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.880
I said in a video,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.520
it's nothing new

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.580
under the sun.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.120
It's like,

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.780
we've got nothing new,

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.700
but this is how

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.540
you approach this problem,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.000
because what I think

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.520
most people don't understand,

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.040
and this is a bit

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.460
of a tangent,

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.020
is what an incredible

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.780
Jenga tower

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.340
Python's packaging is.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.580
Yeah.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.380
Since,

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.080
like,

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.000
we've been building

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.320
these things for 30 years,

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.120
and there's so many

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.880
loose parts,

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.960
and there's so many

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.880
workflows that need

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.540
to be supported,

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.420
and oh my god,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:17.980
I mean,

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.780
just look at

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.780
UV's bug tracker,

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.000
what kind of workflows

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.860
people need

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.920
to have supported,

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.740
and then you understand

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.600
why it's hard,

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.540
and why nobody

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.100
before

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.200
who did not have

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.180
eight people,

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.540
eight hours a day

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.240
working on it

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.100
to really move

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.480
the needle,

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.380
right?

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.940
Yeah,

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:39.440
now with

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.580
0.3.0,

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.120
they've now added

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.220
proper workflow tools,

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.320
which is very exciting,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:46.540
right?

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.900
now we are attacking

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.360
Poetry PDM,

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.200
and they own Rai,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:52.640
actually,

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.700
which they adopted

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.660
from Arm in Ronaha,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.400
and now we have

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.360
cross-platform

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:58.920
log files,

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.800
which is very exciting

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.000
for people like myself

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.160
who develop

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.560
on Mac,

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.180
and an ARM Mac,

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:06.700
no less,

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.320
and deploy

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.180
to Intel

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.860
Linux.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.960
Just asking

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.640
for trouble there.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.200
Yeah.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.600
And just as you said,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.320
this is so incredibly fast.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.280
Like,

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.160
UV sync,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.760
you can call

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.740
after every command.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.020
Like,

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.080
the thing that makes sure

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.300
that all your dependencies

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.380
are at the state

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.540
that is written

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.880
in the log file

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.920
is faster

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.380
than git status.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.020
And I realized that.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:32.900
Then I realized

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.840
what Charlie Marsh

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.320
means,

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.820
what he said

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.780
on your podcast

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.300
the other day,

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.360
that UV is

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.540
categorically faster,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.900
and it just enables

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.340
a completely different

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.140
lifestyle.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.020
Let's call it lifestyle.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.700
It does, yeah.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.260
Yeah,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.480
you behave differently

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.860
when all those commands

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.460
are free,

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:51.960
basically.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.520
And,

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.460
yeah,

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.980
that's UV.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.480
It's a virtual tool.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.120
It also installs Python.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.460
Yeah,

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:00.840
and I think

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.540
one of,

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.800
probably one of the things

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.760
that I was most interested

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.140
about your take.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.580
There was,

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.440
over on Python Bytes,

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.180
we covered this thing

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.260
by Simon Willison

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.480
where he kind of

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.860
summarized a Mastodon

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:15.740
thread

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.400
about UV

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.140
and whether it

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.720
being written

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.240
in Rust

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.300
is detrimental

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.220
to the Python

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.660
ecosystem or not

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.300
and all of those things.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:25.600
But,

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.500
I think it was there.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.640
Your take was,

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:28.940
look,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.960
fast is interesting,

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.240
but one of the really

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:32.980
powerful things,

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.780
I think,

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.600
is here is a single binary

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.880
that if it's on your computer,

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.500
you can do all things Python.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.620
Right?

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.520
And right now,

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.300
it's super,

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.760
without UV,

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.800
it's been really challenging.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.200
Right?

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.240
Maybe,

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.660
I want to use

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.820
pip tools

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.100
or I want to use pip

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.080
to install something

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.780
or all of those things

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.800
are predicated on

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.820
several steps.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.380
Do you have Python?

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.440
Do you have a right version

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:57.860
of Python?

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.380
Have you realized

00:17:59.380 --> 00:17:59.900
you've got to create

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:00.760
a virtual environment

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.360
because you don't have

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.160
right access

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.780
to where,

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.300
there's just,

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.180
before you can get started,

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.380
like,

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:06.540
well,

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.700
here's a whole set

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.500
of conversations

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.400
you need to have

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.840
about not terribly

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.640
complicated things,

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.760
but things that people

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.600
might not care about.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.200
And now,

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.020
if UV is just,

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:15.680
UV,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.320
run,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.700
and even,

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.320
you can even put

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:18.840
in the comment

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.420
in the top,

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:19.720
like,

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.900
these are the three libraries

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.560
I need to run it

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.260
and it'll just run.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:22.900
Yeah.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:23.820
Also,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.380
they don't break.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:24.980
That's what I meant

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.600
with the one binary,

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:25.820
right?

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:25.980
Like,

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.880
I think most of Python's

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.880
bad reputation

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.620
around packaging

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.260
is that things

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.120
just break

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.280
because Homebrew

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.980
updated your Python

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.280
or because

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.320
you didn't activate

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.500
your virtual env

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.640
and accidentally

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.640
installed something

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.980
into your global thing

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.420
or you used

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.160
pip install

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.060
--user

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.940
and now it's

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.020
in all your virtual envs

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.000
and you don't know why

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.380
and there's so much

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.300
unpredictability

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.720
around these things.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:55.540
and now suddenly

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.860
we have like this one thing

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.540
that behaves

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.620
in certain ways

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.540
that people understand

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.400
and that people expect

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:02.980
it to behave

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.060
and as I said before,

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:05.980
this is not necessarily

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:06.900
the way I would like

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.440
it to behave

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.940
but I understand

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.040
why it's so important

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.460
to just narrow

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.260
the envelope

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.880
of packaging

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.640
of the behaviors

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.480
that we expect

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.080
and that we

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.680
as a community

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.800
endorse.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:21.880
yeah,

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.920
totally agree.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.660
There's certain things

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.340
I would like to see

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:25.900
different as well

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.120
but I'm really happy

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.960
that Charlie and team

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.140
are working on this

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.360
and pushing it forward

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.700
and maybe breaking

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.460
some paradigms

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.220
or expectations

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:35.780
saying look,

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.000
you don't even have

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.980
to have Python installed.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.200
we can base it off

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.860
of,

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.820
gosh,

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.480
I forgot the name

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.080
of the project,

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.180
not Dead Snakes

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.420
but the Python

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.100
builds,

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:49.400
yeah,

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:49.960
builds standalone.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.840
That's it.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.440
Exactly.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.560
and we'll just grab it,

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:53.780
right?

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.220
If you don't have

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:54.720
Python installed,

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.440
we'll just grab it.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.440
Now a side issue

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.520
or maybe a tangent

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.480
parallel issue

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.180
is I would love

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:03.980
to see something

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.280
in Python itself

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.560
that gives you

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.040
a binary

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.060
that you can then

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.200
deploy, right?

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:10.840
UV is great

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.560
for getting your machine

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:11.940
up running

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.560
and getting Python

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.460
dependencies on it

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:13.720
and stuff

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.460
but Python

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.720
build

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.380
my folder,

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.320
my package

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.040
with an endpoint

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.000
or something

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.120
like Go,

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.160
like C++,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.960
whatever.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.760
Here's a binary.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.540
You just run it.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.440
It doesn't care

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.100
what's on your machine.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.760
I know there's

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.240
some packaging

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:33.960
type stuff

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.040
like Pyto app.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.780
I have an app

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.480
that's based on that

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:36.920
but it's,

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.800
those are still

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.500
kind of

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.380
trying to piece

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.260
things together

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.660
in a funky way

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.140
that Python

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:44.820
will allow

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.920
rather than

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.340
something truly

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.760
sort of

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.880
part of the.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.300
it's the same

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:51.760
like with the

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.640
standalone builds.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.640
Python really

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.580
fights you

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.400
when you try

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:56.760
to do

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.600
these encapsulated

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.020
things

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.400
and like

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:58.920
my dream

00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.320
outcome

00:20:59.320 --> 00:20:59.780
would be

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.140
if

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.040
these

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.320
standalone builds

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:02.640
would be

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.420
upstreamed

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.320
to proper

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:04.840
cPython

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.920
because this

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.780
is really

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.240
what I would

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.040
like to have

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:08.520
from

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.600
python.org

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.000
like these

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.360
directories

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:11.700
that I can

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.300
put anywhere

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:12.860
and they just

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.200
work.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.800
But

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.040
it's not

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:16.520
trivial

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.160
and

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.000
the

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.440
author,

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.060
the original

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.820
author of

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.080
those

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.420
standalone

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:20.740
builds

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:20.960
because

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.360
it's been

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:21.840
taken over

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.360
by Astral

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:22.740
now too

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.080
but the

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.580
original author

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.460
was Gregory

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.200
Shorts I think

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.940
and he also

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.480
did this

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.360
Pyoxidizer

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.220
project which

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:29.980
was very

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.980
exciting to me

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.460
but he

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:32.860
kind of

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:33.580
burned out

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.160
completely

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.120
on working

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.620
with Python

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:35.960
at all

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.600
because it

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:36.880
was so

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.260
frustrating

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:37.740
for him

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.300
to deal

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:38.660
with these

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.080
things

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.320
and how

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:40.740
Python

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.400
behaves

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:41.940
and fights

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.200
him

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:42.740
when he

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.260
tries to

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:43.660
do these

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.200
things

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.180
and yeah

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:45.840
these kind

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.120
of changes

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:46.760
would have to

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.500
come from

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.440
Python proper.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.500
Yes it would

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.060
have to definitely

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:50.640
come from Python

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:50.980
proper.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.360
Well maybe

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:52.720
someday.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.340
There's some

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:53.760
interesting

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.180
things are coming

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.360
along.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.180
We might even

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:56.720
have Python

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.880
in the browser.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.060
Weirdest things

00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.560
have happened.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.740
Yeah and

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.340
out in the

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.020
audience Tony

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.440
agrees that

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.240
it's super

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:06.840
powerful and I

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.200
haven't thought

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:07.680
much about it

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.000
I won't buy

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.460
anything to do

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:08.780
everything.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.320
It's amazing

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:09.860
indeed.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.220
All right.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.120
So you want

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:13.680
to talk about

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.300
the controversies

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:14.800
to you or

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.680
just a segue?

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.500
Let me just

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.000
ask you a

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.440
question.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.780
So here I

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.120
think the

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:23.620
controversy

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.380
is twofold

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.780
and I

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.520
accept that

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:30.920
it's somewhat

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.700
controversial but

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.620
I wouldn't say

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:32.940
that it's

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:33.740
controversial to

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:33.860
me.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:34.200
I think

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.080
there's two

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:35.340
things.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.280
One UV

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:36.760
is written

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.300
in Ruh

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.260
in Rust

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.200
rough and

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:39.420
rust.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.180
I see the

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:40.820
challenge here.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.140
Written in

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.660
Rust it's

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:44.440
not Python

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.060
so that makes

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:45.440
it harder.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.080
I don't know

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:46.560
any Rust.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.360
I might be

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:47.820
able to look

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.140
at Rust

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.380
codes.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:48.680
I think

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.080
that's Rust

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.460
but I'd

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:50.860
have to do

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.380
some learning

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:51.880
to actually

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.340
do anything

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:52.760
with it.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.260
And the

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:54.860
other is

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.700
venture backed

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.340
versus just

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.000
open source.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.240
Like is

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:00.880
that healthy?

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.840
I think

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.180
for the

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:04.640
Rust part

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.900
for me

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.820
a lot of

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.120
libraries

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.460
are written

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.040
in C++

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.920
and I

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.160
used to

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.640
do C++

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.540
but I'd

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.060
rather not

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:12.680
go do C

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.740
but you

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.020
know

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.780
there's a

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.100
bunch of

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.120
C and a

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:18.580
bunch of

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:18.860
Rust

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.280
they're kind

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:19.960
of similar

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.300
to me

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:20.800
like I'd

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.180
rather not

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:21.520
mess with

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:21.860
those but

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.220
if I had

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:22.520
to I could

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:22.900
learn it

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.540
feeling.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.100
I don't

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.240
feel terribly

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.260
worried about

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.840
Rust in

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.360
that regard

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.640
but I don't

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:30.840
know what

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.020
are your

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:31.260
thoughts?

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:31.880
Just some

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.360
quick takes

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:32.760
on this.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.980
Yeah the

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:34.420
quick take

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.120
is I

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.460
think it's

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.220
much more

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:38.800
a thing of

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.600
context right

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:39.920
now and

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.400
it's actually

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:40.980
how the

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:41.800
threat on

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.120
Mastodon

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.520
started.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.500
We were

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.300
just starting

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:44.680
to get

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.740
off having

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.160
everything

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:46.640
written in

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.620
C so we

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.020
didn't have

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:49.340
to learn

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:49.760
C to

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.340
contribute to

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:50.560
certain

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.100
projects

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.060
because

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:52.620
we

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.080
ported

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.340
them to

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:54.620
Python

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.120
like now

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.780
the Pyrepl

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.720
in Python

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.680
3.13

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.240
which I'm

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:58.540
sure we

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:58.920
were talking

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.100
about is

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:00.380
now in

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:00.820
Python and

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.120
suddenly we

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:01.440
have more

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:01.960
contributions

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.200
right and

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.760
now people

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.560
find this is a

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.580
regression back

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.520
when we start

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.140
moving back to

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.620
Rust which in

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.600
certain ways it

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.320
is but then

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.700
again I think

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.620
people underestimate

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.100
how many Rust

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:16.880
savvy people we

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.400
have now in the

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.920
community so I

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.520
think the

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.560
upsides in this

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.920
case outweighed

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.440
downsides but

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:23.740
of course

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:24.300
everybody has

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:24.660
to decide

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.280
it themselves

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.080
yeah yeah

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.780
absolutely and

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.120
it's open

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:30.560
source if

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.160
something goes

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.420
terribly wrong

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.800
yes MIT

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.460
Apache 2

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.800
yeah yeah

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.940
there's already

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.600
646 forks I'm

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:38.920
sure there'll be

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.300
some more

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.640
no I'm I'm

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.380
happy to see

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:43.920
Charlie and

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.380
team working on

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.200
this and I

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:45.880
told Charlie that

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.000
a few weeks ago

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.620
or a couple months

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.200
ago when he was

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.000
on the show to

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.580
talk about some

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.120
of these ideas

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.320
I think what I

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.180
would really like

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:52.740
to stress here

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.820
is that it's

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.340
not like Astro

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:55.860
came to the

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.140
page and just

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.400
like forbade

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.340
everybody to

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.540
stop to do

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.420
open source

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.680
packaging we

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.560
had like at

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.400
least 10 years

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.480
of trying to

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.140
tackle this

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.120
problem with

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.140
our resources

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:08.740
that we have

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.420
as open source

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.120
developers and

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:11.820
it turned out

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.480
that we cannot

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.320
do that it's

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.100
just a too

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:14.860
complex problem

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.040
and I've

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:16.620
been like just

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.080
a few months

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.120
ago I was

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:18.860
I was literally

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.780
saying that I

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.260
would like to

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.160
see someone to

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.760
just put the

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.480
money where their

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.680
mouth is and

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.580
just bankroll a

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.360
good packaging

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.460
tool and this is

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.040
literally what just

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.900
happened so I'm

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.900
more on the relaxed

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.620
side of that because

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.680
I realized that we

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.480
just couldn't do it

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.380
like we tried we

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.360
failed many times

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.500
like there's a whole

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.300
graveyard of

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.080
packaging tools and

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.840
right now we have

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.820
a good one and

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:43.580
one day we will

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.240
probably have to

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.160
maintain it because

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.300
VC is going to

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.940
VC but it's fine

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.400
it's it's

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.160
interesting that is

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:52.840
for sure I

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.600
definitely know if

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.000
you want to get

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.320
VC funding having

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.020
rust as your

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.920
foundation seems to

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.580
be the trick right

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.640
now but I

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.460
another thing I

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.140
wouldn't you know

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:02.880
while we're on

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.960
this topic you

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.520
made a point in

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:06.900
one of the YouTube

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.220
videos which give

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.980
a shout out to in

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.200
a bit but you

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:11.860
said something to

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:12.980
the effect of you

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.540
be kind to all

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.560
the people who

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.200
have worked so

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:16.680
hard on this

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.640
problem before and

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.260
don't just trash on

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.020
the other projects

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.900
right six months

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.700
ago this thing was

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.680
mission critical to

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.780
you and it was the

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.400
way that you did

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.100
everything and now

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.460
like oh it's people

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.180
just know it's crap

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:29.960
because you like I

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.960
don't I think it's

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.100
it's important to

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.780
keep some perspective

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.240
you know

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.420
yeah I mean I've

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:36.780
been on the

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.620
receiving end of

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.960
such excitement so I

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.900
know exactly how it

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.080
feels and it's just

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.540
you can be excited

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.180
about something

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.720
without saying that

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.020
finally I can stop

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.380
using X and

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.780
ideally add the

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.120
maintainer of X so

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:51.920
they really know that

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.840
you finally don't have

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.560
to use their stuff

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.000
yeah exactly you

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.640
don't have to be

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.160
come on now so

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.020
real quick give us

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.780
some of the tips of

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.920
what you're doing to

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.080
make your your docker

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.060
builds faster I

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.860
know this this build

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.260
cache mount thing

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.900
is pretty interesting

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.720
letting you I mean I

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.500
adopted some of the

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.140
ideas you got in

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.180
here and some of my

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.240
own and docker

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.360
builds went so much

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.360
faster yeah I mean

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.000
the most important

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.640
thing is to have

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.540
multi-stage builds

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.400
which means that you

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.160
have a separate

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.600
container that builds

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.600
your application

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.340
whether it's a

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.060
virtual amphi jam

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.220
as we said before

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:32.940
which I like better

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.080
or if you just build

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.720
it to a directory

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.940
and then somehow get

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.020
it over because

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:39.620
you don't want to

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.380
have a C compiler

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.260
in all your

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.960
production production

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.880
containers so just

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.260
a waste of space

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.520
and as you said

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.420
living off the land

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.160
it's not good

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.660
then you want to

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.220
drop the hackers

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.200
into a desert not

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.700
a lush forest

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.720
exactly I mean

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.200
they're still going

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:56.840
to figure it out

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:57.960
but it's it's

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.720
it's just nicer

00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.600
and easier to

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.160
reason about

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.280
then judicious

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.340
layering makes a

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:03.960
big difference

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.720
that you are very

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.640
clear about when

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.380
you build what

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.340
that you basically

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.160
sort your commands

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.060
in the order

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.080
in that they are

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.880
most likely to

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.260
change

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.800
so in a build

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.580
container that means

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.000
that your last step

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.180
is copying the

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:17.680
application

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.720
and the step

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.020
before is copying

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:20.580
the dependencies

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.060
yeah absolutely

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.000
and so I'll link to

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.540
one of your articles

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.460
here but

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.880
the other thing

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.540
that I think

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.700
is pretty

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.420
interesting that

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:30.960
people maybe

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.640
don't realize

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.680
or haven't used

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:33.960
a lot

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.380
I'm not sure

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.400
if I see

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.540
and here you go

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.400
is

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.660
you

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.720
when you run

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.460
docker commands

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.000
you can say

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.700
dash dash

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.200
mount

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.060
equals

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.360
slash root

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:46.760
slash

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.680
dot cache

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.520
yeah

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.080
that's build

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.600
cache mounts

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.200
that you mentioned

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:50.440
yeah

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:50.860
yeah

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.120
yeah

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:51.180
yeah

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:51.380
yeah

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.060
and what that

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.080
what that'll do

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:53.620
is when

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.040
either

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.640
doesn't matter

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.060
in this case

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:55.520
the way you got

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:55.860
it set up

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.400
either pip

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.400
or UV

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:57.940
if they

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.300
you know

00:28:59.300 --> 00:28:59.880
a lot of times

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.400
when you pip

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:00.880
install something

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.120
they'll say

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:01.720
oh that's already

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.440
cached locally

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.800
we'll just install it

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.500
instead of download it

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:04.720
right

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.500
yeah

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.140
and that'll store

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.360
somewhere on

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.400
the host machine

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.560
all the cache stuff

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:11.840
right

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.840
it depends

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.200
it depends

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.860
so this is

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.660
something

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.620
I didn't spend

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.400
a ton of time

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.120
because you can

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:17.560
configure

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.760
where this is stored

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.800
and in the simplest

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.160
case

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.200
it is just

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.180
pulled from

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.000
the last container

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.640
that you built

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.040
that is like

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:25.880
the simplest

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.380
configuration

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.100
that you can use

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.680
that you say

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.580
so now I tag

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.320
a latest

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:31.920
container

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.580
which I never did

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:32.860
before

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.680
because for deployments

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.120
I usually

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.280
use numbers

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.140
but now

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:36.680
there's always

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.600
a latest tag

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.160
and it will take

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.120
the cache

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:40.560
from there

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.520
so it's most likely

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.180
pretty good

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.320
because it was

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.160
literally the last build

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.440
yeah yeah

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:45.860
okay

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.520
interesting

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:46.940
I see

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.820
that it's part

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.620
of the build cache

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.420
the docker layer cache

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.840
not some folder

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.380
laying around

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.280
I think it's actually

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.120
part of the container

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.000
if I'm not mistaken

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.500
completely

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.440
okay

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:56.980
yeah

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.620
so

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.580
definitely lightens

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.040
the load

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.520
on

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.140
PyPI a little bit

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.740
and makes yourself

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.040
faster

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:03.560
so that's all

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.720
that's all good

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.280
all right

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.480
what is next

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.440
on my list here

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.220
let me have a look

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:13.540
installing Python

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.240
that's probably

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.700
maybe a segue

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.180
that

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.760
keeps us

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.480
in the same realm

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:19.880
honestly

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.860
how do you get

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.420
Python on your

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.460
machine these days

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.260
if you're going

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.280
to work on something

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.540
do you brew install it

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.000
or do you download it

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.380
from

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.160
python.org

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.200
no

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.220
as my friend

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.400
Justin once wrote

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.740
homebrew's Python

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:34.480
is not for you

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.800
that Python

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.220
is for homebrew

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.020
to use in their

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.520
applications

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.580
and you notice it

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.160
very fast

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:41.780
because whenever

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.400
they upgrade

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:42.820
the Python

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.360
all your virtual

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:43.940
lengths break

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.480
so

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.220
this is not

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:46.520
great

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:46.840
so

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.700
I'm on

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.120
macOS

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.020
and

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.140
I'm on

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.360
an Apple Silicon

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.600
Mac

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.060
which

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.460
makes

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.260
things

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:56.860
a bit more

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:57.320
complicated

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:57.720
because

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.440
I need to

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.020
develop

00:30:59.020 --> 00:30:59.680
some of my

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.120
projects

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:00.600
on Intel

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.760
because I

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.120
need to

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:02.660
use a

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.160
driver

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:04.820
for a very

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:05.240
shitty

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.740
proprietary

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.520
database

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:07.920
and

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.660
of course

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.020
they don't

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.440
have that

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:09.980
for ARM

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.940
and

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.360
it's written

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:12.780
in C

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:13.320
or some

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:13.620
sort of

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:13.900
binary

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.360
layer

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:14.660
yeah

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:15.480
binary

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:15.860
blob

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.420
so

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.080
I have

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:18.720
these two

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.000
types

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:19.680
of projects

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.460
and

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.020
so

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:21.220
the

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:21.820
official

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.460
macOS

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.760
installer

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.060
from

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:25.800
python.org

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.480
has this

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:26.820
amazing

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.340
property

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:27.960
that you

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:28.340
get

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.800
python

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.420
3.13

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:31.740
dash

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.380
intel64

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.420
and

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:33.760
when I

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.200
create

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:34.640
a virtual

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:34.800
length

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.080
with that

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.420
I know

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:35.680
this

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.000
virtual

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.300
length

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:36.880
is

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.640
intel

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.600
and

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:38.960
if not

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.500
it's not

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.240
and

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:40.460
it's

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:41.500
very nice

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:41.980
and predictable

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:42.480
for me

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:42.720
so I

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.280
really like

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:43.600
this

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.400
behavior

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.740
and

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:46.280
on

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.380
servers

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:47.680
we use

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.140
dead snakes

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.980
okay

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.300
yeah

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:52.820
very cool

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.360
lately

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:53.860
I've

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:54.040
been

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:54.380
switching

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:54.880
to

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.460
just

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:56.960
UV

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.920
VE

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.280
and V

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.720
give it

00:31:59.720 --> 00:31:59.900
a

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.580
give it

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:00.860
a python

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:01.180
version

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:01.720
which I guess

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.820
indirectly

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.360
is using

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:03.920
python build

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.300
standalone

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:04.840
right

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.700
yeah

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.620
yeah

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.020
they have

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:08.460
a bunch

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.200
of quirks

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.000
based on

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:10.300
the thing

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:10.520
that we

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:10.680
talked

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.040
before

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:11.400
that they

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:11.840
fight

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.620
that python

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.120
fights

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.480
it's

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.060
a little

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:14.320
bit

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.180
so I

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:15.360
cannot

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:15.780
use those

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:15.940
in

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:16.400
production

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:16.800
at least

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.180
not for

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:17.520
everything

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:17.900
because I

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.200
just had

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:18.420
some

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.300
some of

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:19.720
my packages

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.200
just won't

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:20.760
install on

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:20.960
them

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.340
that will

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:21.660
probably

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.100
get fixed

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:22.380
at some

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:22.640
point

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.280
but yeah

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.420
five node

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:24.820
org is a

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.380
safe thing

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.340
and I have

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.160
to shell

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:27.600
my friends

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.160
glyph's

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:28.440
tool

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:28.920
mop up

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.540
which just

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:29.960
allows you

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.600
to upgrade

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.060
those

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.220
installers

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:32.860
very easily

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.720
especially

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.000
when you

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.700
use UVX

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.180
because then

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:35.540
it's just

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.180
one line

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.160
yeah

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:38.820
mop up

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.260
is an

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:41.820
interesting

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.180
project

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:43.780
from glyph

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:43.980
as you

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.400
pointed out

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.200
that will

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.400
update your

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.560
your python

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:47.960
right

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.800
yeah

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.780
yeah

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.260
if you

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:50.360
have

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:50.640
installed

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:50.740
it

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:50.860
from

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:51.560
python.org

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.920
all right

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.540
another thing

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:53.720
that's

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.080
interesting

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:54.580
if you

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.140
install

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:55.680
python

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:55.980
from

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.360
python.org

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.480
is

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.980
in the

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.540
installer

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.060
you can

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:02.760
customize it

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.060
and you can

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.440
check a

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:03.980
checkbox

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:04.760
that says

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.680
give me

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.400
the free

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:06.880
threaded

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.960
python

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.060
let's talk

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:10.320
about

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:10.960
free

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.260
threaded

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:11.620
python

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:11.960
what do you

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.140
think

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:12.700
about this

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:13.260
this is

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:13.840
one of the

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.200
more

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.560
significant

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.180
changes to

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:18.560
python

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.120
and one of the

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:19.680
bigger peps

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.620
you know

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.640
we went through

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.480
the two to three

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.160
controversies

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.160
or challenges

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:24.980
so much

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.680
and I think

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.320
that was largely

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.080
because strings

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:27.660
were changed

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.520
I know there's a

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:28.900
bunch of other

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.220
changes

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:29.980
but it seemed

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:30.320
to me

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:30.760
that the

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.120
real challenge

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:32.560
of a lot

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.160
of the upgrades

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:33.540
of a lot

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:33.760
of the

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.160
packages

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:34.640
been like

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:34.900
well

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.620
that used

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:35.880
to be

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.220
bytes

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:36.980
or strings

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:37.300
now

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.100
we've got

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:38.380
to treat

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:38.820
them differently

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:39.300
and we've got

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.920
to change

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.220
that

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:40.680
that's the

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.100
part that

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:41.560
was really

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.740
took the

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.020
work

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.860
and threading

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:45.460
seems harder

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:45.800
than

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.980
strings

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.000
I don't know

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.400
maybe it's

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:49.640
not

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:49.900
but

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.780
is this

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.080
going to be

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:53.320
a big

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:53.740
challenge for

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:53.920
people

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.140
or what

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:54.260
do you

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:54.500
think

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.380
yeah I guess

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.040
we will see

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.400
right

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.740
like normal

00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.080
code

00:33:59.080 --> 00:33:59.680
is probably

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.000
not going

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.160
to be

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:00.460
affected

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:00.880
a lot

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.300
but

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.500
for example

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.720
it's a

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.360
perfect timing

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.400
since I'm

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:05.800
maintaining

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.460
argon2

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.140
cffi

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.480
and

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.640
as the

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:11.000
name

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:11.520
says

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.300
it depends

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:12.900
on the

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:13.720
cffi project

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.280
to do the

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:14.740
bindings

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:15.420
and it

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:15.780
does not

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.460
support

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.480
free threading

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:18.720
yet

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.140
so I

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:19.340
cannot

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:19.820
build

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.400
free

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:20.740
threading

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:21.040
wheels

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:21.360
with that

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:21.620
yet

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.140
of course

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:22.580
people are

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:22.800
already

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.260
complaining

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:23.860
in my

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.280
issues

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:24.560
about

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:24.840
that

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.900
and

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.700
yeah

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.500
why isn't

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:30.940
your puppy

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.380
parallel

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:31.880
come on

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.080
now

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:32.440
get this

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:32.740
going

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.480
yeah

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.320
so this

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:34.780
is

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.120
there's

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:36.360
probably

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:36.660
more

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.200
projects

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:37.480
than

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:37.700
just

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.180
cffi

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:38.360
that

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:38.880
are

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.160
still

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:39.580
stuck

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:39.920
in some

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.060
way

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:40.260
because

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:40.440
they

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:40.560
are

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:40.960
not

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.600
important

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.000
enough

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.700
for

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:43.920
someone

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.300
from

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:44.560
meta

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:44.840
being

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.480
parachuted

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.020
into

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:46.320
the

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:46.700
project

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:46.880
and

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.060
fix

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:47.500
everything

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.800
I

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.220
personally

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:51.400
am

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:51.600
very

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:51.920
excited

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.180
by

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.180
free

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:53.620
threading

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:53.820
and

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:54.000
I

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.160
was

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:54.340
like

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:54.480
one

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:54.640
of

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.020
the

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:55.840
I

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.020
mean

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:56.340
there

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:56.540
was

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.300
I

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:57.420
don't

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:57.520
know

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:57.620
how

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:57.760
to

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.140
call

00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:58.260
it

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:58.400
but

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.040
a

00:34:59.040 --> 00:34:59.180
bit

00:34:59.180 --> 00:34:59.300
of

00:34:59.300 --> 00:34:59.460
an

00:34:59.460 --> 00:34:59.980
election

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:00.460
right

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.040
to

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:01.400
decide

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:01.540
on

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:01.700
whether

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:01.840
or

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.060
not

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:02.160
and

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:02.220
it

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:02.340
was

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:02.460
like

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:02.700
this

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.960
we

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.180
made

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.900
public

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:07.420
statements

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:07.680
about

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.000
how

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.240
we

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:08.800
feel

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.200
about

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:09.400
this

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:09.600
whole

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:09.880
thing

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.180
and

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:10.540
I

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:10.880
personally

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.300
felt

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.240
good

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:12.520
about

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:12.640
it

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:12.780
back

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:12.980
then

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:13.100
I

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:13.380
still

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:13.600
do

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:13.860
I

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.060
think

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.220
it's

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:14.380
a

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:14.640
big

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.180
chance

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:15.440
our

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:15.760
one

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:15.960
shot

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.120
we

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:16.340
will

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:16.680
have

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.020
because

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:17.900
either

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.180
this

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:18.340
one

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:18.560
works

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:18.900
out

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:19.400
or

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:19.640
it's

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:19.780
not

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:19.900
going

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:19.980
to

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.180
happen

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:20.460
ever

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:20.760
we

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:20.920
will

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.120
never

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:21.280
have

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:21.380
a

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:21.520
three

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:21.860
threaded

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.140
Python

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:22.800
ever

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.260
because

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:23.480
this

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:23.600
is

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:23.880
the

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.340
perfect

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:24.840
constellation

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.100
of

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:25.440
stars

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:25.640
this

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:25.740
is

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:25.880
not

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.080
coming

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:26.680
back

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.240
that's

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.340
a

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:28.500
really

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:28.680
good

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:28.960
point

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.320
we've

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:29.580
had

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:29.920
the

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.440
Gilectomy

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:30.800
and other

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.100
attempts

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:31.520
before

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:31.820
but

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.520
this

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:33.880
is

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.940
it's

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:36.340
fast

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:36.860
it's

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.280
accepted

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.200
it's

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:38.500
already

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:38.860
shipped

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.620
you're

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:39.760
right

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.160
if this

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:40.460
doesn't

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:40.760
work

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.800
we have

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.180
Meta

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:43.620
who

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.320
put

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.100
several

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:46.540
paid

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:46.940
people

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:47.680
on the

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:47.960
job

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.460
to get

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:48.580
it

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:48.800
done

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.660
this

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:50.860
is

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.320
one of

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:51.480
those

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:51.740
things

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:51.880
that

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.280
cannot

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:52.520
be

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:52.780
done

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.060
by

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:53.820
volunteers

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.440
on

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:54.780
beer

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.020
money

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:55.240
from

GitHub

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:55.840
sponsors

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.140
this

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:56.360
is

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:56.720
a

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:56.920
big

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.240
thing

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:57.420
that

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.200
needs

00:35:59.200 --> 00:35:59.700
serious

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.000
money

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.280
to be

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:00.620
solved

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.080
I'm

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:03.340
excited

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:03.680
but I

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:03.820
don't

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:03.980
think

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.100
it's

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:04.200
going

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:04.220
to

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:04.320
be

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:04.500
that

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:04.660
big

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:04.780
of

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:04.880
a

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.120
problem

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:05.400
and

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:05.520
I

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:05.680
think

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:05.820
it's

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:05.920
going

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:05.980
to

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.000
do

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.220
some

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:07.460
very

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:07.860
excited

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.460
things

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:08.640
that

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:08.740
we

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:08.860
are

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.160
not

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:09.400
thinking

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:09.680
about

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:09.900
because

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.100
a lot

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:10.200
of

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:10.320
the

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:10.940
arguments

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.380
against

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:11.540
it

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:11.740
was

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.600
oh

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.040
threads

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.100
are

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:14.520
bad

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:14.760
it's

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.040
hard

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:15.240
to

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:15.460
write

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.000
multi-threaded

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.200
code

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:16.540
which is

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:16.800
all

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.040
true

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.580
the problem

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:18.840
is that

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.140
we just

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:19.480
don't have

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:19.660
good

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.000
APIs

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.500
for that

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.100
you can

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:21.360
build

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:21.620
good

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:21.960
APIs

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.320
for

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:22.780
threading

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:23.840
you just

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.100
have to

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:24.460
look what

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:24.820
Go is

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.040
doing

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.180
with

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:25.440
channels

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:25.780
we can

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:25.960
have

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.440
channels

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:26.720
in

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.040
Python

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:27.840
once

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.280
we have

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:28.640
good

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.260
threading

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.340
but

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.160
we never

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:31.600
bothered

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.320
to build

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:32.600
these

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:32.840
kind

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.000
of

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:33.480
APIs

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:33.760
because

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:33.920
it

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.180
doesn't

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:34.520
make

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:34.740
any

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.000
sense

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:35.140
with

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:35.260
the

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.460
guild

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.860
it's

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.100
better

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.260
to

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:37.400
go

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:37.700
async

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:38.580
that's

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:38.820
a really

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:39.220
good

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:39.900
point

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.540
and

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:41.000
I think

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.200
there's

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:41.340
an

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:41.700
analogy

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:41.960
with

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.380
async

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.000
remember

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.360
async

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:44.640
IO

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.100
shipped

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:45.360
in

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:45.720
Python

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.460
3.4

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:46.740
but

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:47.300
async

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:47.540
in a

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:47.660
way

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:47.880
the

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.320
keywords

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:48.620
in the

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:48.900
programming

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.240
model

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:49.520
shipped

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:49.660
in

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:50.200
3.5

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:50.700
so for

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.120
a while

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.420
it was

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:51.640
like

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.060
well

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.360
you guys

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:53.560
figured

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:53.900
it out

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:54.300
and then

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:54.460
the

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:54.780
programming

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:55.340
model

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:55.680
got way

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.000
nicer

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.940
yeah

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.380
I think

00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.820
we might

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.180
have not

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:00.480
gotten

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:00.800
this

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.180
shot

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:01.620
if

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.500
async

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:02.640
IO

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:02.880
didn't

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.060
happen

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:03.240
back

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:03.400
then

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:03.620
because

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.100
it

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:04.380
just

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:04.740
showed

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:04.960
how

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.180
we

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:05.540
can

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.220
do

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:06.820
like

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:06.960
a

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.200
test

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:07.540
balloon

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:07.700
in

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:07.800
a

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.220
community

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.660
and

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.760
we

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:11.940
don't

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:12.120
have

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:12.480
to do

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:12.660
it

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:13.060
perfectly

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:13.340
on the

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:13.660
first

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.140
time

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.820
I think

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:16.060
we had

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:16.260
even

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:16.600
breaking

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.100
changes

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:17.540
in

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.440
minor

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:18.900
releases

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.140
of

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:19.880
3.5

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.100
because

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:21.440
we had

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:21.600
to

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.160
fix

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:22.600
things

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:22.900
up

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.460
so

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.540
yeah

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.240
I'm sure

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:25.500
it was

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:25.760
a bit

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:25.880
of

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.500
inspiration

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.080
I remember

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:28.480
a breaking

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:28.960
change

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.960
somewhere

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:30.460
in

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:30.840
Python

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.180
but

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:31.500
further

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:31.800
down

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.000
the

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:32.340
road

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.120
where

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:33.480
the

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.500
async

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.260
context

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.960
so

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.240
the

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.020
way to

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:38.280
say a

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:38.520
function

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:38.740
was

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:39.180
async

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:39.700
you could

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.020
use a

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:40.520
decorator

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:40.880
before

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.260
async

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:41.600
and await

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.240
came along

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.740
and

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.100
my code

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:45.420
which was

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:45.640
running

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.320
on MongoDB

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.160
which was

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:47.380
running

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:47.780
on

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.480
which was

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:48.780
using

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.320
motor

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.420
they

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.760
were using

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.240
that older

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:52.940
style to get

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.440
their async

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.160
and then

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:54.540
when it got

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.000
taken out

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.380
of Python

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:55.760
it just

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.160
well

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.520
stuff doesn't

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.000
run anymore

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:58.900
there is no

00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.700
such decorator

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:00.980
async

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:01.280
something

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:01.560
I can't

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:01.740
remember

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.040
exactly

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.340
what it

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:02.560
was

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:02.780
but

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.080
it took

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:04.400
a week

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:04.640
or two

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:04.980
before

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.020
I could

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:06.200
run

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:06.440
the new

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:06.760
Python

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.700
which wasn't

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.180
a big deal

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:08.780
I just

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.420
didn't

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.020
use it

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:10.340
but it

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.100
did break

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:11.400
things

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.080
there was

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:12.540
plenty

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.140
of breaking

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:13.540
changes

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:13.680
in

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:13.960
async

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:14.140
I

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.320
was

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:15.980
quite

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.440
involved

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:16.620
with

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:16.780
that

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.060
whole

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:17.320
thing

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:17.540
and

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:17.800
I

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.340
remember

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:18.700
things

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.020
breaking

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:19.360
a lot

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:19.620
in the

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:19.900
beginning

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.700
but it's

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:20.900
good

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.420
it's good

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:22.660
that we

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.100
don't carry

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:23.320
that

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.240
technical debt

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:24.540
around

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:24.880
with us

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.200
now

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.740
I want

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:27.880
to give

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.200

you're going

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:49.080
to have

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:49.500
a library

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.440
and you

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:50.780
have tests

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:51.140
for it

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:51.780
and it's

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:52.200
supposed to

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:52.560
support

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:52.800
free

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.180
threading

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.220
you should

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:54.420
probably

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:54.820
test it

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:54.960
with

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.220
free

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:55.540
threading

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:55.820
actually

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.120
running

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:56.480
at some

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:56.700
point

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:56.900
right

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.920
so

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.520
anyway

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.520
people are

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.280
trying to

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:02.800
move their

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.320
libraries

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:03.700
along

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.040
and I

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:05.460
think they

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:05.700
said

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:05.920
look

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.580
we tested

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:06.880
this on

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.100
one of the

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:07.420
libraries

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:07.920
that said

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.300
it was

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.200
free threaded

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:09.900
supported

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:10.200
and it

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.900
segfaulted

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.180
Python

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:12.800
so

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.840
maybe it

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.100
wasn't

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.180
quite ready

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:15.820
so run

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.520
your tests

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.220
if you're

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:17.640
going to

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:17.880
support

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.180
this

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.620
I think

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:19.980
it needs

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.180
to be

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:20.520
stressed

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.680
that the

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.160
trick to

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:22.480
not

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.340
break your

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:23.580
code

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:23.780
is to

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:23.960
just

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.340
not

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:24.960
mutate

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:25.400
global

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:25.780
data

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.180
in

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:26.500
multiple

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:26.780
threads

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.280
at once

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.380
just

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.960
avoid

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.280
doing

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:32.660
this

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:32.960
and

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.180
you'll

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:33.320
be

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:33.660
fine

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:33.980
and

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.180
most

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:34.440
people

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:34.880
don't

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.140
so

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:35.500
I

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:35.660
don't

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:36.040
expect

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:36.420
this

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:36.700
large

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:37.060
scale

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:37.580
breakage

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.060
the

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:38.400
problem

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:38.580
is

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:38.760
more

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:38.900
in

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.160
the

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:39.940
lower

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:40.400
level

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:40.760
things

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:40.980
like

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.660
CFFI

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:42.020
and those

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:42.480
kind

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:42.580
of

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:42.840
things

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.060
that

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:43.420
are

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:43.920
going to

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:44.120
take

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:44.460
a lot

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:44.620
of

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:44.800
time

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:44.960
to

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.180
figure

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:45.360
out

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:45.700
I think

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.640
yeah

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.120
I agree

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.620
does your

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:48.920
web

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.300
framework

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:49.800
support

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.100
free

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:50.480
threading

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:50.940
well you're

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:51.060
going to

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:51.400
find out

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:51.920
pretty quickly

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.980
you definitely

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:54.360
will

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.000
okay so

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.360
yeah I'm

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.120
personally excited

00:39:59.120 --> 00:39:59.820
about it as

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.380
well I think

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.000
we're going to

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.300
have a lot of

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:03.600
good times

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.260
what else

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:04.580
about

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.860
3.13

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:06.240
are you

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:06.840
excited about

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.120
so I

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:09.580
feel like

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:11.920
Python 3.12

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.880
and 3.13

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.500
was more

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:13.840
like

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.560
like planting

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.180
trees

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.320
than

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.020
a good

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:18.600
harvest

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:18.980
you know

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:19.300
like

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.560
there's a lot

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.260
of work

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:23.260
a lot of

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:24.040
very very

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:24.860
hard work

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.540
when it

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.000
did these

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.700
two

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.580
releases

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.600
that

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.040
don't

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:30.600
benefit us

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.080
immediately

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.800
but that

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.660
that built

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:34.240
the foundation

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:34.960
for great

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.400
things to

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:35.640
come

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.360
like

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:36.880
free threading

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.100
is an

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:37.400
example

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:37.700
sub

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:38.180
interpreters

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:38.880
are an

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.400
example

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.120
like

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:41.640
internally

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.560
I mean

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:42.940
I shouldn't

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:43.240
admit it

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:43.520
but I'm

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:43.940
also a

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:44.320
Python core

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:44.660
developer

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:44.940
but I'm

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.220
just not

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:45.660
very active

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.140
because I

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:46.340
have

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.560
enough of

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:47.900
my own

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.340
stuff going

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:48.880
on nowadays

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.140
but internally

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.180
the 3.13

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:51.880
is kind of

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.220
called like

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:52.580
a secret

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.700
4.0

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.800
which

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.260
everybody

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:55.600
who has

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.020
to do

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.220
with

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:56.980
C APIs

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:57.460
have

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.120
noticed

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:58.500
because

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:58.840
like

00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.420
unlike

00:40:59.420 --> 00:40:59.740
the

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:00.240
releases

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:00.680
before

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.300
like 3.12

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:01.780
3.11

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.360
it took

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:02.880
quite a while

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.140
for the

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:03.540
ecosystem

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.140
to

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.220
catch up

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:05.880
with

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.540
all the

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:06.880
changes

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.200
to the

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:07.760
C API

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.340
because

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:09.520
there's

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:09.760
been a

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.000
lot of

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.400
changes

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:14.360
I mean

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:14.800
the

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.140
PyRipple

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:15.860
is great

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.380
Pablo

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:17.980
has made

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:18.860
a big

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.220
push

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:19.680
for better

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:19.940
error

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.280
messages

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:20.600
which is

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:20.980
also nice

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.180
yeah

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.360
and they

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:22.720
continue

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.040
to get

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:23.360
better

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:23.880
yeah

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.200
so this

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:25.500
is like

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:25.740
the

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:26.420
things

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:26.680
that

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.140
I'm

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:27.640
truly

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:27.960
user

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:28.360
facing

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:28.600
but

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:28.980
things

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:29.120
that

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:29.260
I

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:29.460
don't

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:29.700
really

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.260
care

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:30.520
about

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:30.880
that

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.140
much

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:31.460
I mean

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.280
I use

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:32.840
Python

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.520
so I will

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.160
probably keep

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.800
using it

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.240
still

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:35.820
I just hope

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.100
that maybe

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:36.900
PDB will get

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:37.200
better

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:37.740
now that we

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:37.920
have a

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.060
better

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:38.440
REPL

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:38.940
because my

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.280
favorite

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.060
debugger

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:40.900
PDBPP

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.560
has been

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:41.980
broken for

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.620
two releases

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.760
yeah so

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.540
that's my

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:45.820
hope

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:46.740
but

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.120
I'm not

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:49.480
really

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.360
excited about

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:50.880
anything from

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.640
3.12 and

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.160
3.13

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:52.700
I'm just

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.600
excited for

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.420
what those

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.200
releases are

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:55.680
going to

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.260
give us

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:56.460
in the

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:56.800
future

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.300
yeah

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.320
I'm

00:41:59.320 --> 00:41:59.780
excited

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.100
for

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:01.680
just the

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.060
entire

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:02.640
faster

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.240
CPython

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:03.860
initiative

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:04.660
as it

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.360
works out

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:05.600
over

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.000
across

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.100
3.11

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:08.720
was probably

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.620
the biggest

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.180
one of those

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:10.480
I guess

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:10.820
although

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.620
we'll see

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:11.960
about this

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.160
free

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:12.500
threading

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:12.920
this might

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:13.380
you know

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:13.600
if you've

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:13.900
got a lot

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.240
of cores

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.320
that's a

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:15.560
massive

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:15.980
difference

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:16.400
if you can

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.260
take advantage

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:17.640
of it

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.900
if yeah

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:19.280
that's a

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:19.540
problem

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:19.740
right

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.140
because

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.220
I think

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.560
what was

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:23.920
said

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.440
that

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.520
they will

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.040
merge it

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:26.760
if the

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.240
penalty

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:27.920
for

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.860
non-threaded

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.120
code

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:29.560
is less

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.280
than 10%

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.160
which it

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:31.420
did

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:31.780
but

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.000
single-threaded

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.180
code

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:33.700
is going

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:33.920
to be

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.300
slower

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.520
in a

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.060
free-threaded

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:36.580
Python build

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:36.820
and it's

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.120
something we

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:37.320
have to

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:37.620
keep in

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:37.860
mind

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.480
right

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:39.980
yeah

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.880
well I guess

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.340
it depends on

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:41.720
your workload

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.020
what you're

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:42.300
doing right

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.340
but with

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.000
little dev

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:44.540
tools I

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.160
fixed

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.360
this

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.080
what's new

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:47.800
in Python 4

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.140
here we

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.040
ship it

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.100
although I got a few more

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.460
spots I got to do a little

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.420
finer in place in this

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.060
document

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.320
looking at the

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:57.800
what's new in

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.240
13

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.620
okay also I think

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.360
yeah I think the new

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:01.680
REPL

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.060
is quite nice

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:03.680
it's been

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.520
using the

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.640
traditional REPL

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.420
I think it's been

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.160
really challenging

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.000
right

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:09.840
did you write

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:09.840
did you write

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.720
a loop

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.920
and you want to go

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.660
back and edit it

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:13.460
well you got to

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.780
okay I remember

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:15.460
that was four lines

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.160
up for the four

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.740
part and then

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.740
the four again

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:18.260
to get you know

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.180
like that was just

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.280
challenging

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.340
to have multi-line

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.220
edits on there

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:22.500
now

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.760
a lot nicer

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.760
just simple things

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.540
like key binding

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.620
sometimes not working

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:28.940
or just printing

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:29.800
weird stuff

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.580
into your console

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:31.540
it's

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.100
yeah but these

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:34.640
are the things

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.380
kind of like

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.380
the virtual

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:36.880
environment

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.220
you know get your

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.020
virtual environment

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:39.760
set up get your

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.660
dependencies installed

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.380
it doesn't sound

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.140
like that big of a

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:43.920
deal but it is

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.880
friction to people

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.640
who come to the

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.040
ecosystem

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:46.720
right

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.900
every paper cart

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.840
less is good

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.840
yeah that's 100%

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.180
right

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.280
definitely good

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.440
YouTube

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.620
I mean look

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:57.120
you're on YouTube

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:57.560
right now

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.240
but we're talking

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:58.680
about you being

00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.000
on YouTube

00:43:59.000 --> 00:43:59.460
on YouTube

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.220
so it's kind of

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:00.400
meta

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.400
but yeah

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.540
you're doing a

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.000
really good job

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:04.760
with your YouTube

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.760
videos lately

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.260
you know

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.160
thank you so much

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:07.860
done a couple

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.340
of the last

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.180
yeah yeah you're

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:09.340
welcome

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:09.800
I think

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.320
you know

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.380
I've done a lot

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.280
of YouTube videos

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.940
but even more

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.060
sit down

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:17.820
by yourself

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:18.400
behind the

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.380
camera

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.380
for course videos

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.440
I have like 270

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.480
hours of course

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:22.820
videos

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.640
and you know

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.260
the editing

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.320
the I'm excited

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.260
to talk to nobody

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:28.760
right

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.420
all of these things

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.380
are not that easy

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:30.780
to do

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:32.380
and yeah

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.040
I want to just

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.300
talk about what

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.100
you're up to

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:35.640
over there a bit

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.440
yeah

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:37.960
I mean

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.820
maybe let's start

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.340
with the silliest

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.560
reason why I started

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:40.980
doing this

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.260
it's

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.640
I'm very aware

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.280
and self-conscious

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.080
about how bad

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.040
my spoken English is

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:46.820
so

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.280
it's my third language

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:48.880
so

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.820
and I don't speak

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.440
it often enough

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.120
so there's this

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:51.760
joke from my

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.260
friends at the

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:52.840
PyCon when the

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:53.700
just arrived

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.460
jet-lagged

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:54.620
Hinek

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.160
who only spoke

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.660
English to the

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.320
US immigration

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.040
officer trying

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:58.440
not to get

00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:58.880
detained

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.300
is very different

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:01.880
from the Hinek

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.520
like a week

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.320
later who

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.280
spoke to his

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.060
friends for a

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:05.500
week right

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.560
so my hope

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:06.920
was that

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.820
maybe

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.100
it forces me

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:09.580
to

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:10.940
speak a lot

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.480
more English

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.100
in my everyday

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:12.500
life

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.680
it turned out

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.540
I'm way too

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:15.320
slow at producing

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:15.740
videos

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:16.400
so that part

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:16.940
didn't work out

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:17.280
at all

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.660
I mean

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:21.140
you say like

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:21.780
300 hours

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:22.220
but for me

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:22.880
like the 25

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:23.460
minutes video

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:23.940
that I've just

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:24.320
published

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.240
that's like

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.100
one hour

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.100
of film material

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:27.540
that I'm

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:27.920
cutting down

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:28.740
to 25 minutes

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.580
yeah

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:29.860
so

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.140
that's

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:31.700
a lot of

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:31.920
work

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.360
a lot of

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:32.720
editing

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.260
and

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.120
yeah

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.320
and

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.100
the most

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:36.940
the more serious

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.400
reason

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.160
that actually

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:38.760
worked out

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.400
and this is

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:39.860
not going to be

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:40.380
all of

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.180
Philly

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.440
is

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.400
I do have

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:44.960
a lot of

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.360
people that

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:45.800
follow me

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.380
across my

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.060
platforms

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.040
and know me

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:48.640
from PyCon

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.340
and I've heard

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:49.740
the term

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.900
PyCon cinematic

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:51.500
universe

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.760
put out

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.420
which I'm

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:54.940
probably

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.020
a part of

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:57.880
but

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.600
this universe

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.140
is tiny

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:00.720
like the

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.400
Python community

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.200
is huge

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:02.700
people don't

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.040
understand

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:03.540
how huge

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.560
they are

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.000
and

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.380
I mean

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:06.700
just like

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.140
this Twitter

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:07.500
account

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:07.920
that post

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.300
just like

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:08.800
these trivial

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.420
things

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.120
that sometimes

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:10.560
outright

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.260
wrong

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.520
and they have

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:12.920
like hundreds

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:13.560
of thousands

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.200
of followers

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.860
and the same

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:16.220
is on

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:16.660
YouTube

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.380
and

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.320
I

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.320
I did

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:20.560
not

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.660
I haven't

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.260
found

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.040
any

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:23.580
Python

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.780
content

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:25.420
on YouTube

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:25.960
that I really

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.340
liked

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.280
like for the

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:27.840
things that I

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.220
care about

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:28.700
like maybe

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:29.480
there's amazing

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.080
data science

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:30.620
stuff there

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.160
but there's

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:31.720
not things

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:32.160
that I care

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:32.440
about

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:32.820
so I

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:33.000
thought

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:33.960
with the

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:34.520
usual

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.140
programmer's

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:35.480
hubris

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:35.940
sure I

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:36.200
can do

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:36.500
that

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.800
and I'm

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.160
trying to

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:39.540
build our

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:39.720
own

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.120
we're doing

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:40.300
it

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.380
how hard

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:41.640
can it

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:41.880
be

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:42.440
and

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.600
I'm

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.000
trying to

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:44.520
do content

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:44.880
that I

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:45.940
wish existed

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.220
for me

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.080
15 to 20

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:48.660
years ago

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.820
but to be

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:50.160
honest like

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:50.500
the ultimate

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.260
trigger is

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:51.620
that

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.260
before

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:54.720
COVID

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.260
I had

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:56.580
like this

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.320
nice lifestyle

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:57.640
where I

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:57.840
broke

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:58.560
one amazing

00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:59.120
conference

00:46:59.120 --> 00:46:59.540
talk

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.700
per year

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.200
like

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.160
scare

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.440
quotes

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.380
and

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:04.220
I could

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:04.640
just like

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.240
travel the

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:05.480
world

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:05.820
and give

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:05.960
it

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:06.380
and this

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:06.640
doesn't

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:06.860
work

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:07.180
anymore

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:07.580
like the

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:08.000
conference

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:08.480
world has

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.140
more or less

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:09.780
collapsed

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:10.860
conferences have

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.240
no money

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:11.640
anymore

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.380
it's much

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:12.700
harder to

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.180
get invited

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:13.980
so

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.100
and it

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:16.420
was kind

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:16.720
of like

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.660
I told you

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:18.340
I work for

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:18.940
small companies

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:19.860
so like my

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.960
actualization

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.440
and creativity

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.360
comes mostly

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:22.820
from the

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.200
community

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:23.980
and I

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:24.980
felt like

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.580
being cut

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:25.840
off

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.200
like I

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:26.680
couldn't do

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.500
my creative

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.100
work anymore

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.340
because I

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:29.740
couldn't

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:30.160
I couldn't

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:30.800
pay for all

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:31.320
those flights

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.660
and the

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:34.080
same happened

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:34.600
to writing

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.520
I mean

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.320
whatever

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.400
Google and

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:37.740
Twitter are

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:38.120
doing right

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:38.500
now

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:39.660
unless your

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.100
blog post

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:40.580
lands on

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:40.960
Hacker News

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:41.540
front page

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:42.860
you basically

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:43.800
get no more

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.460
traffic anymore

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.120
it's

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:45.600
it has been

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.000
completely

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:46.640
obliterated

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.080
like my

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:47.560
blog has

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.560
like 40%

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.180
less traffic

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:50.780
than a year

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:51.040
ago

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:51.540
and I don't

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:51.840
think it's

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.100
that my

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.300
content got

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:53.580
stale

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.060
it's

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:54.820
it just

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:55.600
changed

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.920
so I

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.260
thought

00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.220
I should

00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:58.940
try a new

00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.200
avenue

00:47:59.200 --> 00:47:59.620
I should

00:47:59.620 --> 00:47:59.960
go where

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.260
the people

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:00.620
are

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.260
I've read

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:02.440
somewhere

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:02.880
that like

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.440
YouTube

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:03.840
is the

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.320
second biggest

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:04.860
search engine

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:05.320
or something

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:05.720
so

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.320
yeah

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.620
trying my

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:08.880
hand

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.260
yeah well

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:11.440
nice work

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.540
nice work

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.160
it's

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:14.500
it's an

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:14.880
interesting

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.240
outlet

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:15.560
and you

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:15.700
know

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:16.140
you look

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:16.440
at

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.740
it's

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.600
the numbers

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.200
are ridiculous

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:19.720
right

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.980
and look

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:21.280
at

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.340
oh this

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:22.820
person just

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:23.300
posted a

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:23.920
video on

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.360
this and

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.380
six hours

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:25.860
later it

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.280
has more

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:26.740
views than

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:27.260
if it was a

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.020
major television

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.220
series or

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.140
something like

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.940
it's a weird

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:32.200
world

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:32.740
it's a weird

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:33.220
world for

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:33.560
sure

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.440
yeah

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:34.800
I mean

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.940
I'm a

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:36.400
niche in

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:36.780
a niche

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:37.580
so I

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:38.120
don't expect

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:38.540
ever to

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:38.860
blow up

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:39.420
like this

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:39.720
but

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.940
yeah

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.740
we'll see

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:42.980
how it

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:43.240
goes

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:43.920
it's still

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.860
great

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:46.120
let's

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:46.920
talk a

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.220
little bit

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:47.620
about some

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:47.820
of your

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.340
projects

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.180
you talked

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:49.420
about

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.060
argon

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.380
I think

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.060
maybe one

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:52.380
of the

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:53.280
things you're

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:53.640
best known

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:54.060
for might

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:54.280
be

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:54.740
adders

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:55.100
what do

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:55.440
you say

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.240
what do

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:56.500
you think

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.480
it depends

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.200
who you

00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:58.620
ask

00:48:58.620 --> 00:48:58.960
yeah

00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:59.400
okay

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.360
I think

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:00.780
adders

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:02.080
had the

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:02.300
biggest

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:02.740
impact

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:02.960
on the

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.240
community

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:03.640
because

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.160
they are

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:04.320
the

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:04.700
direct

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:05.180
predecessor

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:05.380
of

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:05.560
data

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:05.920
classes

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.360
that

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.440
I

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:07.920
designed

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.260
with

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:08.560
Guido

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:08.920
and

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:09.200
Eric

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:09.500
back

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:09.760
then

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.760
that

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.240
goes

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:11.480
back

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:11.620
to

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:11.880
adders

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.100
because

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:12.340
people

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:12.580
wanted

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:12.840
something

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.080
like

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:13.340
adders

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:13.500
in

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:14.120
that

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:14.720
standard

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.160
library

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.340
but

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.920
yeah

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.440
tell us

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:18.880
tell people

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.100
about

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:19.380
adders

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:20.000
for those

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:20.220
who don't

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:20.480
know

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.360
yeah

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:24.940
I mean

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.440
imagine

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:25.860
data

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.220
classes

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:26.500
but

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:26.740
more

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.060
powerful

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:29.380
people

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:29.820
sometimes

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:30.360
try to

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.580
compare it

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:31.820
to

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:32.420
PyDentic

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:32.880
but

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.340
that's

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:34.780
not that

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:35.900
adders

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.300
is not

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:36.760
trying to

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.080
be

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:37.340
a

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:37.760
validation

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.200
thing

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.220
adders

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:39.580
is

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:39.900
there

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.540
for

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.340
creating

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:41.800
classes

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.160
that you

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:42.400
would have

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:42.620
written

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:43.080
yourself

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:43.840
and

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:44.960
I call

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:45.100
it

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:45.460
like a

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:46.240
class

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:46.660
writing

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.280
toolkit

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.200
and

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.320
data

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:49.600
classes

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.000
keep

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.520
catching

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:50.740
up

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:50.860
with

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:51.000
what

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:51.160
we

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:51.400
do

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:51.700
but

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:51.880
we

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:51.980
are

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:52.180
still

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:52.460
ahead

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:52.740
so

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:52.940
we

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:53.080
have

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:53.300
more

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:53.700
features

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:54.400
we

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:54.600
work

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:54.920
better

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:55.320
and

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.720
especially

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.020
for

00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:58.280
data

00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:58.540
science

00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:58.880
things

00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.200
because

00:49:59.200 --> 00:49:59.400
we

00:49:59.400 --> 00:49:59.760
allow

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.240
people

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:00.440
to

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:00.940
define

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.160
comparisons

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:02.640
in a

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:02.900
custom

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:03.140
way

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:03.280
so

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:03.380
you

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:03.500
can

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.060
compare

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.040
NumPy

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:05.680
arrays

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.780
and

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:07.900
you

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.060
don't

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:08.220
need

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:08.340
to

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:09.540
use

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:10.200
type

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:10.640
annotations

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:10.820
if

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:10.920
you

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.100
hate

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:11.320
them

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:11.760
that's

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.000
also

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.120
a

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:12.220
big

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:12.500
feature

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:12.760
yeah

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.120
okay

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:14.920
interesting

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:15.620
yeah

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:15.960
so

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:16.740
when you

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:17.080
create

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:17.400
a

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.120
class

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:18.740
you know

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:18.940
you can

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.240
just put

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:19.420
some

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:19.660
fields

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:19.940
on it

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:20.220
and that's

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:20.480
great

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.620
but

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:22.420
there's

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:22.720
probably

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.080
some

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:23.340
other

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:23.620
things

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:23.960
you might

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.120
want

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:24.480
to do

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:24.860
like

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:25.480
define

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:25.660
a

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.100
hash

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:26.640
and define

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:26.780
an

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:27.140
equals

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:27.520
and a

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:27.680
not

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.040
equals

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.420
and

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:29.900
a

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:30.680
stir

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.220
and a

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:31.500
repper

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:31.900
and all

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:32.100
these

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:32.340
kinds

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:32.460
of

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:32.900
things

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.880
and

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:35.580
you

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:35.820
just

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:36.580
get that

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:36.800
out of

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.120
the box

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:37.340
right

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.040
and

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:38.260
maybe

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:38.440
you

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:38.700
want

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:38.920
the

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.320
class

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:39.640
to be

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:39.960
frozen

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:40.620
maybe

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:40.780
you

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:41.000
want

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:41.520
slots

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.040
and

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:42.460
these

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:42.620
kind

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:42.720
of

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.060
things

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.740
slots

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:45.320
interesting

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.300
I don't

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:46.420
know

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:46.700
everyone

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:46.960
knows

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:47.160
about

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:47.420
slots

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:47.740
slots

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:47.880
are

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.120
kind

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:48.260
of

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:48.880
a

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.180
cheat

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:49.420
code

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:49.660
for

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:50.040
low

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:50.420
memory

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.600
fast

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.800
access

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.960
tell people

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:55.480
about slots

00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:55.860
dunder

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.140
slots

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:57.420
well

00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.280
when you

00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:58.640
create a

00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:58.940
class

00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.080
in

00:50:59.080 --> 00:50:59.360
Python

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.080
by default

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:00.500
it's

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:00.700
a

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:01.040
so-called

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:01.460
dictionary

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:01.940
class

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:02.180
because

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:02.540
it has

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:02.780
a

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:03.180
dunder

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:03.660
dict

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:04.680
field

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.080
where

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:05.740
all the

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:06.660
attributes

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:06.980
are

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.340
defined

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:08.180
and

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:08.520
you

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:08.680
can

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:08.800
do

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:08.920
with

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:09.040
those

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:09.280
classes

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:09.520
whatever

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:09.720
you

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:09.880
want

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:09.980
you

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:10.080
can

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:10.240
just

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:10.540
add

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:10.740
more

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:11.240
attributes

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.100
but

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:12.420
if you

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:12.960
define

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.140
a

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:13.440
slotted

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:13.920
class

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:14.460
which

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:14.900
doesn't

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:15.060
have

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:15.200
this

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:15.720
dunder

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:16.180
dict

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:16.380
but

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:16.880
dunder

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:17.380
slots

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:17.920
and

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.300
you

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:18.860
enumerate

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:19.340
all

00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:20.040
attributes

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:20.240
that

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:20.460
this

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:20.800
class

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:20.980
will

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:21.260
have

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:21.420
and

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:21.600
it's

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:21.760
then

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.020
baked

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:22.300
into

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:22.440
the

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:22.780
class

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:23.760
so

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:23.980
this

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:24.140
has

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:24.320
the

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:24.520
big

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:24.880
upside

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:25.540
if

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:25.860
you

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:26.460
try

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:26.640
to

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.380
assign

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:27.560
an

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:27.880
attribute

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:28.160
that

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:28.480
doesn't

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.040
exist

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:29.540
it

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:29.760
will

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:30.080
throw

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:30.260
an

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:30.540
error

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.560
which

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:31.800
is

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:31.980
good

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:32.220
because

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:32.460
it

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:32.680
probably

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:32.920
means

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:33.060
that

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:33.200
you

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:33.900
mistyped

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.040
and

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:35.180
this

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:35.280
is

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:35.420
like

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:35.580
the

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:35.760
thing

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:35.880
that

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:36.000
you

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:36.080
see

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:36.320
from

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:36.460
the

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:36.820
outside

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:37.040
from

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:37.160
the

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:37.420
inside

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:37.640
it's

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:37.800
much

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:37.960
more

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:38.240
interesting

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:38.480
because

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:38.700
those

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:39.040
classes

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:39.280
are

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:39.500
more

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:39.800
baked

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.740
so

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:40.840
they

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:40.920
are

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.080
just

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:41.480
faster

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:41.680
they

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:41.780
are

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:42.120
faster

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:42.400
and

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:42.600
use

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:42.820
less

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:43.220
memory

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.100
yeah

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:45.240
they

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:45.420
use

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:45.800
quite

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:45.920
a

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.060
bit

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:46.400
I

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:46.720
think

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.720
named

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.140
tuples

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.480
use

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:48.720
more

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.080
memory

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:49.620
and you

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:49.880
think

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.660
tuple

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:51.800
is

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.600
about

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:52.840
as

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.060
bare

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:53.320
bones

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:53.500
as

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:53.620
it

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:53.760
can

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.000
get

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:54.300
but

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.500
yeah

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:55.840
it's

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.300
quite

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:56.600
interesting

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.500
my

00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:57.940
experience

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:58.260
is

00:51:58.260 --> 00:51:58.520
that

00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.080
even

00:51:59.080 --> 00:51:59.660
attribute

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:00.140
access

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:00.620
is

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:00.780
a

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:01.020
tiny

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:01.220
bit

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:01.600
faster

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.100
than

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:03.480
regular

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.100
classes

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:04.720
yeah

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:04.940
and this

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.080
is

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:05.340
why

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:05.880
in

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:05.980
the

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:06.100
new

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:06.500
APIs

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:06.820
it's

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:06.980
the

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:07.320
default

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:07.500
in

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:07.820
others

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.340
like

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.360
data

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:10.680
classes

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:10.980
grew

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:11.380
slots

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:11.640
too

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:11.840
but

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.140
it's

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:12.540
optional

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.000
in

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:13.240
others

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:13.500
it's

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:13.820
now

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:14.920
opt

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:15.560
out

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:16.280
because

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:16.560
it's

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:16.740
really

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:16.940
good

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:16.960
oh it

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:17.280
is

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:17.720
yeah

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.040
yeah

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:18.420
because

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:19.420
why not

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:19.600
and

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.280
my

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:20.720
experience

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.120
is

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:21.380
it's

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:21.580
cool

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:22.020
to have

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:22.240
the

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:22.720
dynamic

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.240
nature

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.240
of

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:24.820
classes

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:25.080
and

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:25.380
types

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:25.640
and you

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:25.960
can do

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:26.340
all sorts

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:26.680
of stuff

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:26.960
to

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.540
change

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:27.720
them

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.400
but

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:28.640
most

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:28.800
of the

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:28.960
time

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:29.080
you

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.020
don't

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:30.660
and

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:30.820
if

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:30.960
you're

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.100
not

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:31.340
going

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:31.640
to

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:31.980
like

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:32.100
you

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:32.320
said

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:32.560
get

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:32.920
the

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:33.540
I

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.180
mistyped

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:34.560
something

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.800
catch

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:36.280
because

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:36.440
it

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:36.640
won't

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:36.780
let

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:36.900
you

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:37.100
do

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:37.280
it

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:37.920
and

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:38.140
the

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:38.380
better

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:38.800
memory

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.080
and better

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:39.560
performance

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:39.860
right

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:40.340
yeah

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:40.560
I think

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:40.880
this is

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.360
something

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.100
that

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:42.900
Rust

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:43.120
has

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:43.540
changed

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:43.900
too

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:44.660
the

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.020
influence

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:45.400
of Rust

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.000
on Python

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:46.300
has been

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:46.640
that we

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.400
got a little

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.040
less dynamic

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:48.800
with time

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.340
which I

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:49.680
personally

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.140
think is a

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:50.520
good thing

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.200
because I

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.160
started moving

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:52.680
away from

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.200
that sooner

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:53.640
like

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.820
using

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:55.540
dictionaries

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.240
and tuples

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:56.660
and all these

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:56.920
things

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:57.460
it's

00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:58.500
just

00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.260
very hard

00:52:59.260 --> 00:52:59.720
to reason

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.000
about

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.400
when you

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:00.820
come back

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:01.220
like a year

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:01.480
later

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:01.780
and try

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:02.300
to understand

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:02.600
what this

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:02.780
code

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.220
is doing

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:03.760
so

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.720
yeah

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.420
yeah

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.640
what is this

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.320
star star

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.080
kwh orgs

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:08.280
thing

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:08.660
what are we

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:09.140
doing here

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.380
there's still

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:10.760
so many

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.220
APIs

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.960
you have a

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.740
nice IDE

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:14.660
you press

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:15.120
F12

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:15.600
you jump

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:15.960
to the

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:16.300
function

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.320
and it's

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.120
star star

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:18.780
kwh orgs

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:19.780
and thank you

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.400
yes exactly

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.920
you know

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.000
if that works

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:24.500
out well

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:24.980
there might be

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:25.420
a big

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:25.960
doc string

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:26.340
that says

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:26.700
these are

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:27.140
the seven

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:27.620
things that

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.040
can actually

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:28.540
go in

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:28.940
these keyword

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:29.460
arguments

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.060
and here's

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:30.480
their type

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:30.980
and here's

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:31.900
it's true

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.580
yeah

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:35.640
it's actually

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.840
true

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:37.160
or it's

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:37.420
actually

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.060
comprehensive

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.460
yeah

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:40.040
I don't

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:40.120
know

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:40.500
I feel

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.220
a lot

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:41.580
of times

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:41.820
if

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:42.660
when you're

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:42.980
doing that

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:43.220
kind of

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:43.420
stuff

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:43.900
if you end

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:44.240
up back

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:44.460
in the

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.100
documentation

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.100
like something's

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:46.480
kind of gone

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:46.880
a little bit

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.220
wrong

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:47.720
like you should

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:48.200
probably be able

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:48.520
to tell

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:48.900
at least

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.060
does it

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.120
take arguments

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:52.940
what might

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:53.680
they possibly

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.060
be

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:54.420
you know

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:54.720
but

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.880
then you go

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:56.020
to the

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:56.540
documentation

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:56.940
it's auto

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:57.340
generated

00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:57.580
you're like

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:57.760
well

00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.920
no

00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.980
not getting

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.220
far

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:00.480
on this

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:00.720
one

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.940
well

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:02.860
since we're

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.020
we have

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:04.360
this

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.620
the

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:06.260
opinion

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:06.540
of

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:07.000
Hennick

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.520
episode

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.120
what are

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:09.420
your thoughts

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.000
on types

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.280
I love

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:12.660
types

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.640
like I just

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:14.800
said

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.220
I was

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:16.120
moving to

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:16.820
like more

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:17.300
static

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:18.480
things in

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:18.680
general

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:19.120
because it's

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:19.520
just easier

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:19.940
to reason

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:20.180
about

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:21.040
easier to

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:21.640
understand

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:22.960
and it

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:23.600
informs the

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.040
design of

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:24.780
APIs too

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:25.260
like which

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:26.140
I just

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:26.640
find the

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.280
APIs that

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:27.840
come out

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:28.400
nowadays

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.520
are

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.040
widely

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:30.700
more

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:31.420
accessible

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:31.920
than we

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.240
used to

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:32.560
have

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.960
unless

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.600
Lukasz Langer's

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.340
keynote a few

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:36.760
years ago

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.400
at PyCon US

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:37.780
was like

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:38.420
if something

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:38.880
is hard to

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.080
type

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:39.680
maybe it's

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.180
just bad

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:40.620
design

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:41.900
that's an

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:42.240
interesting

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:42.560
take

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:42.840
yeah

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.540
it's not

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:44.160
always true

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:44.480
by the way

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:44.840
like there

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.780
are legitimate

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:46.760
use cases

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.380
for Python

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:47.880
where

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.980
typing is a

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:49.540
bad fit

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.860
and it's

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:51.500
completely true

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:52.080
and it's

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:52.420
not great

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:52.900
for everything

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.560
but I

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:53.840
personally

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:54.280
just take

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:54.880
any help

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.140
that I

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:55.540
can get

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.100
that helps

00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:57.580
me to

00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:58.140
make my

00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:58.620
code more

00:54:58.620 --> 00:54:59.060
understandable

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.740
and help

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.180
me like

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:03.440
ensure that

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.700
I'm writing

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:05.040
what I'm

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:05.500
thinking I'm

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:05.840
writing

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.900
like types

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:07.420
help me the

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:08.100
best with

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.100
finding

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.760
logic errors

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.320
in what I

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.120
thought I

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:13.760
was passing

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.280
around and

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:14.600
what I was

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.320
actually passing

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:15.980
around because

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.680
like things

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.700
that work by

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:19.620
accident because

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.200
something gets

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:20.920
auto converted

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:21.660
somewhere are

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:21.980
the most

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:22.560
dangerous things

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:22.940
because they

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:23.820
explode when

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:24.580
you are on

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:24.840
the beach

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:25.080
with your

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:25.520
margarita

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.300
yeah they

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:27.540
do and

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.140
that's not

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:28.640
good as we

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.120
already pointed

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:29.400
out

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.480
you know

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:30.980
another thing

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:31.360
that I really

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:31.860
like about

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:32.480
them I'm

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.100
kind of on

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.560
on your team

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:35.100
with this one

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:35.820
as well and

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:36.500
I really like

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.120
that I hinted

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:38.580
to that before

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:39.100
you don't have

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:39.460
to go to the

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.220
documentation and

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:40.860
go like what

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:41.540
is this I know

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:41.980
it says it

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:42.720
takes an

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.100
options but what

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:44.700
is an options

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:45.320
you know like I

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:45.860
have no idea what

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:46.540
goes here still

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:47.160
this doesn't tell

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.120
me but if it

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:48.700
means it's this

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.460
class or it's a

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:50.160
dictionary well at

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:50.840
least you got some

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:51.380
hints on like

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.060
well this is where

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.180
where I start

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:53.700
knowing what I'm

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:54.180
supposed to do

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.560
here and also

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.140
with the editor

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:57.040
right if I hit

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.440
dot it gives you

00:55:59.440 --> 00:55:59.940
a way better

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:00.820
chance of just

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.820
continuing to

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:02.500
type instead of

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.120
going looking up

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:03.440
stuff

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.780
and also that's

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:06.400
something people

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:06.920
don't talk that

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.380
much about but it

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:09.300
forces you to give

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.180
things names you

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:13.640
know and sometimes

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.180
when you have

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:16.200
problems to give a

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.000
type a name that's

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:18.660
a sign that you

00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:19.900
don't quite understand

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:20.460
what the thing is

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:21.200
doing or maybe it's

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:21.760
doing too many

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.520
things and it

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.660
just that way you

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:25.040
have like this

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.000
instant feedback about

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:26.880
your design and how

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.540
you think about

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:28.620
things and that I

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:29.340
find I find it very

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.720
useful and also I

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.240
have to point is

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.480
if typing would

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.680
be just marking

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.340
things that could

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:36.420
be none or not

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:37.100
that would be

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.380
already like 99%

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.400
of the value of

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.460
types like just

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:43.320
helping to avoid

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.140
non-type errors

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:46.360
yeah

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.500
optional or not

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:48.060
optional what are

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:48.480
we going to do

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:48.720
here

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.380
yeah

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.300
yeah I do like

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:51.860
that it's

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.660
optional that it's

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.100
progressive

00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:55.200
right

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.020
yeah

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:56.840
you know I

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.640
I came from

00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:58.720
static languages

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.200
to Python and

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:00.740
the fact that it

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:01.400
didn't have types

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.040
I kind of wanted

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.540
something but I

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.300
also played around

00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:05.000
with TypeScript

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.760
and I've

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.420
battled with the

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.200
TypeScript system

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.100
where it's like well

00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:10.640
we don't know what

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:11.440
this thing is but

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:11.920
you're supposed to

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.620
pass in something

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:13.580
that's known in the

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:14.120
type system

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.880
I know this will

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.780
work just get out

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:17.480
of my way and let

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.120
me do it you know

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:18.780
what I mean and

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:21.100
and I think there's

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:21.840
a right a pretty

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:22.880
good balance that's

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.400
caught here

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.160
yeah I think so

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.400
I have a whole

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.220
keynote in my head

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:28.400
about the true

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.100
Python superpower

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.420
is the graduality

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:31.340
because you can

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:32.320
start with the

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.600
biggest trash

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.260
shitty code in a

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:35.920
Jupyter notebook

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.700
and just work

00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:38.700
yourself up by

00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:39.300
putting it in a

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:39.960
file running

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:40.660
rough linter

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.100
then adding types

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:42.960
and what and so

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.680
on and you end up

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:44.740
with production code

00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.480
of the best kind

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.060
but you started with

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:49.000
complete shit and

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:49.640
that's how my brain

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.800
works like I like to

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.220
try things out and

00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:53.120
then just polish the

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:53.380
turd

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.240
polish it when it's

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:56.900
proven that it's

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:57.520
worth putting your

00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.420
time and energy to

00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:58.580
right

00:57:58.580 --> 00:57:59.060
and I find it's

00:57:59.060 --> 00:57:59.840
very frustrating

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:00.620
with languages like

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:01.460
Rust or Go which

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:02.640
I read a lot of Go

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.820
and Go won't even

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:04.880
compile your thing if

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:05.980
you have an unused

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:06.920
import and this is

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.080
just so frustrating

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:10.240
oh my gosh

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.320
just eat my trash

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.060
and make it work

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.300
I will fix it later

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:13.820
I promise

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:16.540
that's a pretty

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:17.240
interesting take

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.720
all right well

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.280
let's

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:23.160
give it a shout out

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:23.540
to

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:24.500
stamina

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.780
also

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.400
like that's

00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.360
that's a

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.580
surprise hit to me

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:30.440
yeah

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.740
yeah

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:32.980
it's like

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:33.400
from my

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.860
latest projects

00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:35.640
kind of the

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.820
most popular one

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:37.160
because

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.240
it just solves

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.160
the problem we all

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:39.960
have that we use

00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.960
tenacity which is a

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.220
great

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:41.940
great

00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:44.600
sorry I muted

00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:45.260
myself for a second

00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.800
we all used tenacity

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.600
which is a great

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.080
package

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:50.260
but it has no

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:50.960
good default

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.680
because it's also

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.520
a very old package

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:54.820
and everybody's just

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:55.920
copy pasting

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:56.980
these standard

00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:58.060
settings around

00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.060
that make it behave

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:00.840
in a good way

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.800
and it's also

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.720
at least back then

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.400
didn't do proper

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:04.780
typing

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.740
so I just wrote

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:07.580
this tiny shim

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:08.140
around that

00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:08.900
so I can stop

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:09.600
copy pasting

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.820
the same things

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:11.680
over and over again

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.660
it turns out

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:13.180
a lot of people

00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:13.600
have the same

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:13.940
problem

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:14.240
so

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.740
yeah

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:18.680
yeah so if

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.460
you've got a function

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:20.200
for example

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:20.540
like you'll

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:21.280
example here

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.320
that might

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.800
crash because

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.340
HTTP error

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.140
like you know

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:27.640
what if I just

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.360
tried this again

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:28.820
I bet it would

00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:29.140
work

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:30.180
right

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:30.780
just add

00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:31.160
stamina

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:31.960
dot retry

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.520
specify the error

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.340
yep

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:35.120
I'm

00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:35.840
I don't

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:36.360
it's been a while

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:36.820
since I checked

00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:36.960
it out

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:37.500
but it's got

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:38.140
like exponential

00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:38.720
back off

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.280
and other

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.540
things like

00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:42.460
oh and jitter

00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:43.160
okay nice

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.120
yeah

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.700
I use it

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:47.760
in certain things

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.800
it's not very

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.580
often that you need

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:50.200
something like this

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:50.880
but when you do

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.240
you're like

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:51.620
oh yes

00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:52.320
it's getting this

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:53.280
you know

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.580
like in my experience

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:55.060
you need it

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:56.080
whenever you talk

00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:56.960
to external systems

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:57.340
because

00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:58.060
if you're doing

00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:58.480
this API

00:59:58.480 --> 00:59:59.400
it will fail

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.040
at some point

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:00.380
and just

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.060
just put it

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:01.440
on it

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.700
and just

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.860
I mean

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:04.420
nowadays it has

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:04.920
a lot of more

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.320
features

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.020
like you can

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:06.560
now like

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.080
have a callable

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:08.600
that decides

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:08.940
where you

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:09.440
want to really

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.240
want to retry

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:10.680
for example

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.060
you've got an

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:11.740
HTTP error

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.960
but in HTTPX

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:13.320
there's no

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.100
difference between

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:14.940
HTTP error

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.880
because you got

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.680
a 500 back

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.460
or because you got

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:19.320
a 401 back

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.480
if you keep

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.240
retrying on

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.380
401 or 403

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.100
you will get

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:23.520
banned from

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:23.940
the API

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.320
right

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.100
but on the 500

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:26.640
you probably

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.500
want to retry

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:28.300
these kind of things

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.260
yeah

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.160
yeah absolutely

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.840
yeah the whole

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.460
rate limiting thing

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.200
that's also

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.880
tricky to work

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.100
with

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:37.680
but I suppose

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:38.240
if you said

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:38.620
like okay

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:39.460
well retry it

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:40.020
but put some

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:40.680
kind of delay

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:41.000
you know

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:41.280
maybe

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.880
maybe it'll be

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.140
alright

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:43.680
yeah

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.180
the delay is

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:44.600
built in

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.380
that's the whole

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:45.600
point

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.340
it's exponential

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:46.820
back off

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.900
yeah

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:48.360
perfect

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.120
one thing

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:50.740
I do want

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.180
to talk about

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:51.660
as well

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:52.200
is just

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.260
Argon

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.560
real quick

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:54.880
like

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.320
very

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:57.960
very cool

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:58.580
algorithm

01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.440
it's

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.480
one of these

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.320
so called

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.080
memory hard

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.060
problems

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.380
that

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.400
is somewhat

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.360
resistant to

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.060
brute forcing

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:08.680
over just

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.240
massive parallelism

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:10.940
and so on

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.000
want to talk

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:12.300
about that

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:12.640
real quick

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.300
sure

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.320
what do we

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:15.720
want to hear

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.640
well just

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.040
tell people

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:18.620
what it is

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.120
maybe you know

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:19.600
what's your

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.180
project about

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:20.520
and what

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.940
should people

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:22.680
consider using it

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:22.920
you know

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.660
yeah so

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:24.380
many many

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:24.960
years ago

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.000
I think it was

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:26.660
like 2016

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:27.120
or so

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:27.580
there was this

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.420
password hashing

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:28.840
competition

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.760
because we

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.420
needed to

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:31.020
find a way

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.520
to hash

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.240
our passwords

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:33.860
in a way

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.080
that is

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:35.360
as you

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:35.740
just said

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.440
memory hard

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.260
so

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:37.540
right

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.320
if you hear

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.220
of rainbow

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:39.900
tables

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.180
you shouldn't

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:41.520
be using

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.060
md5

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:42.600
all these

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:43.120
things are

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:43.480
like all

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:43.820
part of

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:43.900
that

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:44.200
like we

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:44.460
got to

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:44.840
get past

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.000
that

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:45.220
right

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:45.900
yeah

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:46.540
so this

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:46.780
is like

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.280
next level

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:47.780
because people

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.220
were running

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:48.900
ASICs

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:49.320
so like

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.200
programmable

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.360
boards

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.020
that are just

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:52.780
specifically

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.540
for cracking

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.100
passwords

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.240
in parallel

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.960
the only way

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.480
to get

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.680
to fight

01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.040
this

01:01:59.040 --> 01:01:59.540
is make

01:01:59.540 --> 01:01:59.940
it memory

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:00.220
hard

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:00.660
so like

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:01.640
checking

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.280
these passwords

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:02.760
or hash

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.460
this hashing

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:04.240
algorithm

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.020
also needs

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:05.660
a lot of

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.320
memory

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.240
to work

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.400
there's

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.640
one more

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.480
famous

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:12.820
one

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:13.180
which is

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:13.500
called

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.460
scrypt

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.080
or yescrypt

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:15.380
which is

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:15.860
now it is

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:16.300
also part

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:16.560
of the

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:16.780
standard

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:17.160
library

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:17.640
so

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.720
that's

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:18.920
that

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.160
but

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.080
argon2

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:20.660
won the

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:20.940
password

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.240
hashing

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:21.620
competition

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.980
and

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:23.300
yeah

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.420
it works

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.420
it's

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:27.400
in wide

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:27.840
use

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.480
and

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:28.900
yeah

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:29.240
I'm

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:29.520
maintaining

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:29.920
it for

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.340
now like

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:30.820
six years

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:31.300
or something

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.100
or I think

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:32.380
longer

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.700
so if

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.120
you're storing

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:34.600
your own

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.200
passwords

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:35.940
certainly

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.900
this is

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.160
one of the

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:38.620
good options

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:39.540
do you know

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:39.820
what the

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:40.360
story is

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:40.620
with

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.980
oh gosh

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.680
what is it

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.420
is it

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:44.920
passlib

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.400
I believe

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.820
oh

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:47.360
passlib

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:47.880
oh man

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.400
this is

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:48.920
yeah

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.460
this is

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:49.680
really

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.520
man

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.620
passlib

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:52.600
is throwing

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:52.960
a lot of

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.340
warnings

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:54.020
about

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:54.660
things

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.080
that it's

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:55.460
using

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:55.920
that are

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.220
being

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.060
deprecated

01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:57.440
or even

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:57.820
removed

01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:58.980
I feel

01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.340
like it

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.180
it was

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:00.800
really great

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.320
for a while

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:01.620
but

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.320
you know

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:02.660
now

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.920
if you

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.360
go to

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:04.500
it

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:04.700
it's

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.000
like

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.940
yeah

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:07.200
last

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:07.480
edited

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:07.940
four years

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:08.140
ago

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:08.380
that's

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:08.460
a

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:08.740
problem

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:09.200
yeah

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:09.580
it's

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:09.920
it's not

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.240
great

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:10.520
and

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.080
I feel

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:11.360
like it

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:11.980
was on

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:13.960
almost on

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.500
SourceForge

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:14.860
or something

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:15.400
for a while

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:15.760
which is

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.080
really

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:16.900
I can't

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:17.060
remember

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:17.380
exactly

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:17.620
where I

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:17.800
saw

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.320
Bitbucket

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.200
Bitbucket

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:20.420
is fine

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:20.720
yeah okay

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.140
Bitbucket

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:21.500
is fine

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.180
no it's

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:22.340
not

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:22.540
it's

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:23.100
it's

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:23.380
gone

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.700
oh is

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.120
Bitbucket

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:25.480
gone

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.180
yeah more

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:26.420
or less

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.340
you can

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:27.820
see the

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:28.300
the URL

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:28.880
this is

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:29.200
a

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:29.760
heptapod

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.400
which is

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:30.960
like the

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:31.440
only

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.300
mercurial

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:32.840
hosting

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.440
that

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.300
open source

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.960
projects

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.420
can use

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:36.880
nowadays

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:37.420
yeah

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.980
there you go

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:39.360
Bitbucket

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:39.720
deprecating

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.120
mercurial

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:40.500
support

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:40.800
yeah

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.680
I see

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.000
yeah

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:42.240
yeah

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:42.300
yeah

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.020
all right

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:43.240
but will

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:43.640
they also

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:43.980
have

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:44.960
argon2

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.480
support

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:45.860
which is

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:46.680
they use

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.140
my library

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.340
yeah that's

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:48.540
what I

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:48.740
thought

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.180
yeah that's

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:49.360
what I

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:49.560
thought

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.900
yeah super

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:51.200
cool

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.620
awesome

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.160
all right

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.540
well let's

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.220
let's close this

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:56.820
out with one

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:57.380
more take

01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:58.560
before I think

01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.100
we're pretty much

01:03:59.100 --> 01:03:59.660
out of time

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:00.760
but it's been

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.340
a lot of fun

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.080
LLMs

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.300
LLMs writing

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.020
code for us

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.300
are we just

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:07.740
going to be

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:08.280
out of work

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.500
in a year

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:09.880
or two

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.920
what do you

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:11.260
think about

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:11.400
this

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.320
I'm not

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:12.840
super worried

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.180
about it

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:13.600
but it's

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:13.880
definitely

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.340
changing

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:14.700
things

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:15.040
I think

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:15.440
when you

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.120
say we

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.000
it can

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:17.720
mean we

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.100
the two

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:18.500
of us

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.120
and the

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:19.640
answer is

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.320
clearly no

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.220
I think

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:22.000
we as

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.720
Michael and

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.020
Hinnick

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:23.900
will benefit

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.660
from LLMs

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.080
I think

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.060
but we

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:27.420
as

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.440
programmers

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.700
in general

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.520
and especially

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:32.360
junior programmers

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.240
that's going

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:33.760
to be a

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.280
different thing

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:34.580
and I

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.140
wouldn't dare

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:36.720
to

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.500
guess

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.360
how that

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:39.720
will play

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.000
out

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:40.740
like

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.660
I'm

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.560
personally

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.540
using

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:44.100
LLMs

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:44.580
I

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:44.940
use

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:45.860
Anthropic

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:47.520
but

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:47.920
I

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.160
use

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:48.360
it

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.060
in

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:49.240
a

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:49.540
way

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:49.880
that

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.340
I

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:51.760
feel like

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.000
you have

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:52.200
to be

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:52.420
very

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:52.840
senior

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.300
to

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.760
actually

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.160
use

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:55.440
that

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.160
because

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:56.380
when you

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:56.680
ask it

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.120
for code

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:57.460
you just

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:57.700
get

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.240
code

01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:58.540
with

01:04:58.540 --> 01:04:59.220
old

01:04:59.220 --> 01:04:59.680
libraries

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.080
because

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:00.880
it's

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.360
trained

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.020
on

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.160
old

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:03.500
code

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:03.720
from

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:03.960
GitHub

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.420
right

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:05.020
I

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:05.980
copilot

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.300
once

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:06.560
gave

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.080
me

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.320
SQL

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:08.920
injection

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.280
code

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.960
it

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.100
will

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:12.180
be

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:12.660
fine

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:13.760
I

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:13.960
mean

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.540
what

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:15.760
is

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:15.920
the

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.180
most

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:16.860
common

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:18.180
security

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:18.580
problem

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:18.760
with

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:18.980
code

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:19.400
SQL

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:19.840
injections

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.120
of

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:20.380
course

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:20.640
it's

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.200
going to

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:21.360
be

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:21.520
in

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:21.700
those

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:22.240
LLMs

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:22.560
and

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:22.940
suggesting

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:23.140
it

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:23.260
to

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:23.460
me

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:24.900
and

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.860
so

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.000
I

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:29.220
think

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:29.380
it's

01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:29.560
going

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:29.700
to

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:30.060
it

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:30.200
is

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:30.300
a

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:30.540
useful

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:30.940
tool

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.820
it

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:32.160
usually

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.120
doesn't

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.340
actually

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:39.640
need

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.160
so

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:41.500
that's

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:41.600
what

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:41.720
I'm

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:41.820

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.160

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.440
what

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:43.960
it's

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.200
actually

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:44.460
really

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:44.660
good

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:44.880

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:46.060

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:46.820
because

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:47.300
my

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:47.640
brain

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:47.840
I

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.160
somehow

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:48.440
I

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:48.640
cannot

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:48.960

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.880

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:50.660
like

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:51.780
I

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.000
just

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:52.720
the

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:53.360

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:53.720
I

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:53.900
just

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:54.360
can't

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:54.520

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:54.700
I

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.060
usually

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:55.440
ask

01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:58.200
me

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:58.320
and

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:58.640
just

01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:58.960
write

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:06.540
you

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:06.720
need

this

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:10.560
is

I've

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.020

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:22.080
nice

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:22.480
it

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:22.640
lets

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.600
I've

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:27.920
they've

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.060
both

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:28.340

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:36.900

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:37.280

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:37.840

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:37.980

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:20.780
problem

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.120
not a

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.760
problem

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.960
The

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.400
friction

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.000
to ask

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:26.940
LLM

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:27.420
is much

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.440
smaller

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:28.700
than

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.120
asking

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:29.700
actual

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:30.140
people

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:30.480
and

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.240
get

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.580
trolled

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:34.840
by

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.340
some

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:36.060
moderator

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:36.480
or

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:36.780
whatever

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:37.960
so I

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:38.300
can see

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:38.740
that people

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.480
are going

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:39.920
to

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.680
prefer

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.280
LLMs

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:41.800
to talking

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.240
to people

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:42.800
and also

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.240
most

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:43.740
questions

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.160
on Stack

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:44.440
overflow

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:44.800
quite

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.240
trivial

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:45.600
to be

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:45.920
honest

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.320
so I

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:46.540
think

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:46.680
that

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:46.860
makes

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:47.240
sense

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.780
how do

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:49.920
I

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.260
connect

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:50.500
to a

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:50.820
database

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:51.100
using

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:51.320
this

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:51.660
library

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:51.900
right

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.080
like

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:52.340
yeah

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:52.580
yeah

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:53.000
yeah

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:53.480
or how

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:53.860
do I

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:54.220
disable

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:54.720
SSL

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.140
because I'm

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:55.320
getting

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:55.620
this

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:56.740
certificate

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:57.120
error

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:57.420
all the

01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:57.680
time

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.720
classics

01:07:58.720 --> 01:07:59.740
yeah

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.340
but it

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:02.800
also means

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.180
that a lot

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:03.640
of trash

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.020
code is

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:04.460
being written

01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:04.900
right now

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.040
right

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:05.340
like the

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:05.740
things that I

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:06.140
just told

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:06.240
you

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.120
that where

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:07.500
you and

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.060
I we

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:08.340
look at

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:08.700
this code

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:08.860
and we

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:09.260
say okay

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:09.840
this in

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.200
principle

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.340
is useful

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:12.640
but I

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.040
cannot put

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:13.280
this into

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:13.660
production

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:14.460
because

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.360
error

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:15.640
handling

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.340
is wrong

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.020
or there's

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:17.820
some security

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:18.180
issue

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:18.580
or whatever

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.360
this is

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:20.800
something that

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.580
actually concerns

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:21.920
me

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.040
like a lot

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:24.360
of people

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:24.720
are writing

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:25.180
code they

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:25.360
don't

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:25.840
understand

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.180
and putting

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:26.400
it into

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:26.780
production

01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:27.240
and I

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:27.580
think that's

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:27.780
going to

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.080
have

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.540
consequences

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.160
that are

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:30.440
not going

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:30.620
to be

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:30.900
pretty

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:31.980
yeah

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:32.660
I totally

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:33.020
agree with

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:33.100
you

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:33.540
and also

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:34.740
one of my

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:35.080
concerns

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:35.540
you touched

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.060
on as well

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:36.400
is like

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.380
how do you

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:37.880
go from

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.460
beginning

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.020
developer

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:39.840
to

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.500
slightly

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:41.980
beyond

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.360
junior

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:42.960
developer

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.220
right

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:44.520
that

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.020
I don't

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:46.220
know if

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:46.620
LLMs are

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:46.740
going to

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:47.080
help people

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:47.500
make that

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.040
jump quicker

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:48.920
or if

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.420
they're just

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:49.800
going to

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.160
make that

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:50.480
jump

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.360
like a

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:51.860
wider

01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:52.280
chasm

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:52.780
because people

01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:53.200
won't need

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:53.580
juniors

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:53.980
because they're

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:54.240
just going

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:54.620
to ask the

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.180
LLM to

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:55.620
just do

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:56.040
the thing

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:56.400
you know

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.320
yeah

01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:58.920
this is

01:08:58.920 --> 01:08:59.600
the problem

01:08:59.600 --> 01:08:59.780
like

01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:03.060
bean counters

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:03.560
are going to

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.040
look into

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:04.440
Excel

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.680
and I

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:05.920
got to

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.160
wonder

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.060
what makes

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:07.600
more sense

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:07.840
right

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.060
the fact

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:09.480
there

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.200
are

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:10.520
eating

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:10.860
their

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:11.180
seed

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:11.400
for

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:11.620
next

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:11.980
year

01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:12.300
and

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.100
suddenly

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:13.640
oh my

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:13.880
god

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.340
why are

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:14.460
there

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:14.900
no

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.240
new

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:15.700
senior

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.260
software

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:16.700
engineers

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.460
well

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:17.880
we didn't

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.320
make them

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:18.840
but

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:19.160
yeah

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:19.680
it's going

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:19.860
to be

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:20.100
like

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:20.360
a

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:21.040
kobold

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:21.640
right

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:21.780
there'll

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:21.980
be

01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:23.160
fewer

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:23.500
people

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:23.860
who are

01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:24.120
really

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:24.960
needed

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.320
to keep

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:25.540
things

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:25.880
working

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.540
we will

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:26.700
never

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.160
retire

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:27.520
Michael

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.340
exactly

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.660
yeah

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:29.880
we're

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.040
going to

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:30.200
be

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:30.600
programming

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:30.940
on the

01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:31.140
beach

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:31.420
with our

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:31.900
margaritas

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:32.640
in our

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.200
70s

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.800
well

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.300
let's

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:35.580
leave it

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:35.880
there

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:36.440
is that

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:36.760
