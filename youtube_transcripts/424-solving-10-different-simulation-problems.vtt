WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
- Hey, Alan, welcome to Talk Python to Me.


00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.840
Welcome back.


00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.520
- Thank you, it's a pleasure to be here.


00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.960
- It's a pleasure to have you back.


00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.720
We were talking just a little bit before the show,


00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.760
realizing it's only been, only been six years


00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.000
since you were on the podcast.


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.080
How about that?


00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.280
- Yeah, it's great.


00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.200
- Yeah, it's last time we talked about Python


00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.800
and engineering way back in 2017,


00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.800
which was a lot of fun and has some interesting lead-ins


00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.500
to some of the things that are actually created now.


00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.260
You were hinting, I'm working on this project


00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.900
about simulating things with Python and stuff.


00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.760
And here we are talking about it.


00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.860
- Yeah, I was just getting started then


00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.060
and the book has come out very recently.


00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.300
So we've kind of bookended the project.


00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.140
- Mm-hmm, absolutely.


00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.560
Well, it's quite a project


00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.700
and it's a very interesting one.


00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.940
I think a lot of people out there,


00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.300
they hear maybe they should use Python instead of MATLAB


00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.300
or some other language for modeling their domain, right?


00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.180
And with your book that you put together,


00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.180
which is available for purchase,


00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.180
or you can read it online for free, if that works for you,


00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.300
it has a bunch of different examples.


00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.660
How many examples, maybe 30 or so?


00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.100
- I think that's right.


00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.880
There are examples in the chapter and then case studies


00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.400
that get into more detail.


00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.260
- Yeah, so there's a lot of different areas


00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.200
of specialization where you're bringing Python


00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.840
to answer problems.


00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.280
And we're gonna have a lot of fun talking about that,


00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.580
but let's just do a quick catch up.


00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.920
It's been six years since we last spoke.


00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.720
What have you been up to?


00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.240
- Well, I've changed jobs a couple of times.


00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.600
I was a professor at Olin College for 19 years.


00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.040
I left at the end of last May,


00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.680
and then I was at Driven Data for a little while,


00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.040
working on data competitions and machine learning.


00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.740
And then recently I've joined Brilliant,


00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.540
where I'm doing curriculum design.


00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.740
- That sounds very fun.


00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.560
First of all, leaving college, you were at for 19 years.


00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.980
That's a big deal.


00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.760
- Yeah, I've been an academic


00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.240
pretty much all the way through.


00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.360
I graduated from college, I went to grad school,


00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.000
I had my first job, I was a faculty member at Colby College


00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.680
and then Wellesley College.


00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.260
And then as I said, I've been at Olin for 19 years.


00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.360
So it's a real change of career.


00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.680
- How's it going?


00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.400
- It's good, I'm learning a ton.


00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.560
You just, you know, whenever you start something new,


00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.480
you're always, you know, you're on this, you know,


00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.860
the steep part of the learning curve, which is challenging,


00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.240
but it's also just exciting.


00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.400
You're getting exposed to different things,


00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.080
learning a ton.


00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.440
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.800
And working at Brilliant now,


00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.000
Brilliant's a good company.


00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.940
They've been past sponsors of the show, which is great.


00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.200
And maybe just talk a bit about how you think


00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.440
about curriculum and design,


00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.200
since that's what you're focused on there.


00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.340
How do you think about putting together


00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.880
small class, not semester-wide classes


00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.240
for people to learn?


00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.720
- Yeah, that's a big part of it.


00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.280
It's a different format.


00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.160
It's smaller, as you said.


00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.640
It's interactive in the sense that the learner


00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.400
is interacting with these graphical elements


00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.040
and other ways of communicating ideas visually.


00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.340
We use a lot of animation.


00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.480
And the text is deliberately very concise.


00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.440
We're trying to show, not tell.


00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.080
And that's a really different kind of curriculum design.


00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.940
For me, I'm used to, I have a semester long course.


00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.860
I've got several hours a week.


00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.580
It's very different.


00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.100
And that's part of the challenge that was appealing to me.


00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.500
Because I saw some of the courses,


00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.780
and I was very impressed with the pedagogy


00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.460
and the opportunities that you have there with animation


00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.380
and sound and interactives.


00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.820
It's a very different kind of teaching.


00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.500
But it's not--


00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.300
Yeah.


00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.540
There's no-- I don't have any interaction with students.


00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.380
So that's a challenge as well.


00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.380
It's a big challenge.


00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.380
I went from teaching in person to teaching online as well,


00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.580
not too brilliant.


00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.540
But I think there's a couple of really big differences.


00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.860
One is when you're either--


00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.460
you have a student for a semester, Monday, Wednesday,


00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.820
Friday, at 11 to 12, or if you're


00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.620
doing a week-long training class in person,


00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.820
those groups are captive.


00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.980
And so the constant need to keep their attention


00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.780
for every single minute is really different, right?


00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.900
Because it's not impossible,


00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.200
but it's rare that students just get up and walk out


00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.020
because there's a five minute section


00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.000
they weren't engaged with,


00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.900
but they could easily leave a website.


00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.260
- Yeah, and it's particularly in a format like Brilliant,


00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.660
there's not a certificate at the end.


00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.660
The motivation to keep going is you're having a good time


00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.620
and you're intrinsically interested in the topic.


00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.600
So from my point of view as an instructor,


00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.120
the challenge there is to maintain that.


00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.700
It has to be interesting, engaging all the time.


00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.440
As you said, if you've got a five minute lull,


00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.600
you might lose your audience.


00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.440
- Yeah, yeah.


00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.460
The other part that is a big difference


00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.360
is when you have those folks in class,


00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.800
even in a Zoom meeting to a degree,


00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.240
you get immediate feedback of how does an idea land?


00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.480
If I present it this way, are they engaged?


00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.800
or they clearly not getting it,


00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.440
whereas you put it out into the world


00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.740
at Brilliant or TalkByThunder or wherever,


00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.560
and they've got to, you know,


00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.480
you take a guess and you put it out there, right?


00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.320
You don't get that feedback.


00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.480
- Yeah. - Not directly.


00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.180
- That's definitely challenging.


00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.560
We do have some signals where we can see


00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.460
if a learner is getting stuck in a particular place,


00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.800
or if we see a lot of drop-off on a particular lesson,


00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.800
we can go in and try to figure out what's happening.


00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.520
We get a little bit of explicit feedback,


00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.400
sometimes the learners will tell us what's wrong.


00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.240
But most of the time, you're kind of,


00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.980
it's on you to make sure that that lesson works.


00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.440
And your colleagues were constantly reviewing


00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.520
each other's lessons and looking for those places


00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.320
where we think we might lose learners.


00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.140
- Yeah, excellent.


00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.880
Well, I'm sure it's a lot of fun.


00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.760
Some nice comments in the live chat out here,


00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.240
people appreciate that as well.


00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.800
So one thing that you said you learned,


00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.800
which I haven't really learned before is,


00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.680
I don't even really know what it looks like, is Elm.


00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.560
Tell us about Elm, what is this?


00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.440
- Yeah, so this is a programming language.


00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.920
As it says, it's primarily for web applications.


00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.680
It is a functional programming language


00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.600
and it's mostly a stateless computational model.


00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.340
So it's very different from Python.


00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.980
I've just been learning it.


00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.880
This is what we use for a lot of the interactive elements.


00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.560
And it was new to me.


00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.480
I had, honestly, I had not even heard of it,


00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.560
but it's been great.


00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.640
I just, you know, it's been a little while


00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.400
since I learned a new language.


00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.200
It's been about 23 years since I learned a new language.


00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.120
And I've done functional programming,


00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.680
but I haven't used it, you know, really for applications.


00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.080
So this has been, you know, challenging, but fun.


00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.120
It looks a little bit like Lisp meets HTML.


00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.640
- That's not bad.


00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.480
Yeah.


00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.300
- Okay.


00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.900
- Certainly the semantics is very Lisp like.


00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.760
The syntax can be, although not so many parentheses.


00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.560
(both laughing)


00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.400
- Not as many.


00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.760
Get that blister on your pinky or whatever finger


00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.400
you use for the, maybe your right index finger.


00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.240
- Right.


00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.060
- Or ring finger.


00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.300
- Yeah, and then the syntax,


00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.380
it has a couple of nice features like pipes.


00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.500
So, you know, taking a value


00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.380
and piping it through a sequence of functions.


00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.260
And of course, you know, functional features


00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.720
like passing around functions as first class objects


00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.900
and partial function evaluation.


00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.740
So-


00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.460
- Is this a front end language like JavaScript


00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.660
or is it a backend language more like Python?


00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.300
- Yeah, no front end, it's getting compiled into JavaScript.


00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.140
- Okay.


00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.440
- But it is strongly typed, like extremely strongly typed,


00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.800
like integer and float are incompatible types.


00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.640
So--


00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.460
- There we go.


00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.000
- So very strongly typed,


00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.320
but that along with a lot of error checking


00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.760
gives you some more confidence


00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.280
that if you put this on a webpage


00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.360
and a large number of people interact with it,


00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.660
there are maybe fewer errors that can get past a compiler.


00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.840
You know, a really dynamically typed language like Python,


00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.080
you're rolling the dice.


00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.960
you deploy that code, you know, some of those lines of code


00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.120
have never run. And the first time they do, you might be in


00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.440
trouble.


00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.760
Yeah.


00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.040
The type hints are helping my pies helping but that's not a


00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.640
runtime thing. Pydantic, for example, is a runtime version


00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.320
that option that helps a lot. Before we move off this front


00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.800
end stuff, though, we'll get to the modeling. Have you been


00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.200
tracking pi script and the front end Python stuff? Is that


00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.880
interesting to you?


00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.280
It definitely is and especially from a teaching point of view


00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.920
Getting people into python


00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.560
One of the challenges, you know from way back has always been how do you get?


00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.920
a new programmer to the point of


00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.540
executing their first line of code


00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.920
and that


00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.680
That is definitely not as big a barrier as it used to be


00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.520
It used to be you know, you had to install things and download things and all that


00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.200
But yeah, the lower that barrier, the better.


00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.640
And yeah, I think PyScript is one of the things that can help to lower it.


00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.680
Yeah, I do too. I'm very excited about PyScript.


00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.920
It had been interesting in the realm of


00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.240
kind of different ways to execute notebook style code


00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.880
and so on when it was based on Pyodide.


00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.480
And now that they're talking about moving to MicroPython,


00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.400
it starts to get to the realm of it.


00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.400
it could download the same size as Vue or Angular almost.


00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.960
And then it becomes,


00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.480
maybe you can make real apps with this thing.


00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.960
So I'm looking forward to see where that goes.


00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.780
- Oh, interesting.


00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.000
I had not heard about that.


00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.480
So that's exciting.


00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.320
- Yeah, yeah.


00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.080
One of the big things that they're trying out,


00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.920
I had a couple of the folks on from various projects


00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.120
four or five months ago,


00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.160
is they're trying to,


00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.880
instead of using full CPython as the foundation,


00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.080
to use MicroPython,


00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.760
which means the download goes from like 10 megs


00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:58.280
to 100K. Yeah, you're talking 100K downloads, you know, that's kind of like a big JavaScript.


00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:03.240
And if it's over CDN, and it's cached, you know, maybe, maybe you could just make that part of your


00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:09.480
app, in general, not as a specialized thing. Yeah. Well, that's, that's interesting,


00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.960
particularly because I think one of the other challenges for Python right now is


00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:22.120
it takes a while before you're doing really interesting stuff. And, you know, JavaScript,


00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:28.120
for example, you can immediately start doing front end kinds of interactions.


00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:34.680
And a beginner can start to write programs where it resembles the kind of apps that they're using.


00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.480
And I think that's a pretty important hook. For Python, that's a long path.


00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.000
And so it sounds like this could shorten that path quite a bit.


00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.240
It sure could. That would be very interesting. I think your insight there comes in as a bit of a


00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.920
a teacher as well, right?


00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.180
Like it's one thing as an engineer,


00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.320
like I'm gonna build this thing,


00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.260
so I'm gonna choose this language for such and such.


00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.720
But as a teacher, you realize like,


00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.500
if you don't have a win early enough in the learning cycle,


00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.920
then you might just bail.


00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.600
And for a lot of people, a win is I have a UI.


00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.640
I have a thing that looks like an app


00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.040
that I could see on my phone,


00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.400
or I could see in my web browser


00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.240
or something like that, right?


00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.600
- Yeah, definitely.


00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.320
Or a robot or some interaction with the real world.


00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.480
But yeah, converting Fahrenheit to Celsius,


00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.520
it's not gonna do it.


00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.560
- No, but Celsius to Fahrenheit, that one is the one.


00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.520
That's the one, no.


00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.520
Okay, but speaking of converting numbers and so on,


00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.560
let's talk about your latest book.


00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.080
You have a lot of books over at Green Tea Press.


00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.040
This is your home for where your books go, right?


00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.880
- Yeah.


00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.840
- As well as links to other ones you've written


00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.440
at places like O'Reilly.


00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.580
- Right, yeah, so everything starts here


00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.420
and there's a free version of all of the books


00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.880
and you can get to it from here.


00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.240
You can see kind of the evolution of my process


00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.260
'cause some of the earlier books,


00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.760
some of them look better than others,


00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.080
let's put it that way.


00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.440
And then links there for the ones that have been published,


00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.800
there are hard copies available


00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.480
and electronic versions in convenient formats.


00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.160
- I think we might've spoken about this six years ago,


00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.120
but it was six years ago


00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.720
I'm not sure and I imagine a lot of people don't remember it.


00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.920
Did we talk about your textbook manifesto?


00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.520
What is this?


00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.920
>> That was what really got me started.


00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:32.400
And it came from my frustration with existing programming books,


00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.920
but also just textbooks in general.


00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.840
The way they're used in a lot of classes.


00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.480
They are expensive.


00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.800
They are way too big.


00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.520
You know, if there are 700 pages or 1,000 pages, nobody's going


00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.760
to read that in a semester.


00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.680
And if you're assigning 50 pages a day,


00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.140
I think you're kidding yourself.


00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.280
And the students are not getting much out of that.


00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.800
So this is the idea that you can write a book that your students


00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.160
can read and understand, and that is at the size


00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.840
where you can do something like a flipped classroom, where they


00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.040
are actually going to do some reading before class.


00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.040
not 50 pages, but 10 maybe.


00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.340
Come to class.


00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.380
Now, as an instructor, I can help to figure out,


00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.460
what are the problem spots?


00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.960
What should we cover in class?


00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.980
What can we do to practice those ideas in class


00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.440
to take advantage of the time


00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.240
when we're actually in a room together?


00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.620
So, read when you're on your own,


00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.240
come to class, let's do things that are more useful


00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.720
than me standing at the front of the room talking to you.


00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.960
- Yeah, sure.


00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.560
Okay, that makes a lot of sense.


00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.560
So let's dive into your book,


00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.840
Modeling and Simulation in Python.


00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.120
Now, as I'm going through this,


00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.040
I'm not sure what I would classify it as.


00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.360
Is this a science book?


00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.600
Is this an engineering book?


00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.800
Is it a programming book?


00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.240
It kind of feels like it's a little bit of all of those.


00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.820
How would you, what's your elevator pitch here?


00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.180
- Yeah, it's that.


00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.080
It is the solution to a chicken and egg problem,


00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.520
which is that in an engineering curriculum,


00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.480
a science curriculum, and maybe even more broadly,


00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.480
I think, for teaching physics and math to almost anyone,


00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.200
a computational approach is really appealing.


00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.720
There are things that you can do with computation


00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.240
that are very difficult to do analytically.


00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.800
You can do more interesting things faster.


00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.520
So that's the appeal.


00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.280
The hard part is most people are not coming into college


00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.720
with programming experience.


00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.880
Some do, most don't.


00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.960
So whatever your curriculum is,


00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.320
but let me focus on engineering,


00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.040
'cause that's where I was.


00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.160
You've got a cohort coming in who have programmed,


00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.080
a cohort who have never programmed,


00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.480
and then kind of maybe a middle,


00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.080
maybe they've done like HTML or something like that.


00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.680
And now I wanna teach them physical modeling,


00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.360
but I have to do kind of three things at the same time.


00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.760
The modeling piece, the physical models,


00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.120
the domain knowledge.


00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.120
if it's a scientific system or an engineering system,


00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.520
whatever it is, and programming.


00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.760
And there's no good sequence.


00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.680
Like I can't send people out


00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.440
to take a computer science class,


00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.320
and then they come back and we do computational science.


00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.700
It just, there are a number of reasons


00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.320
that that doesn't work.


00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.600
And same thing, if they go,


00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.620
let's say they go take calculus or linear algebra,


00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.800
and then they come back, collecting that knowledge


00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.960
and then trying to synthesize it is really hard.


00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.240
And it means it's a sequence of courses


00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.760
instead of starting in right from the beginning.


00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.080
So those are some of the problems


00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.520
that we were working with.


00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.880
And the best solution, at least we think,


00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.280
is put it all together.


00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.560
We're gonna teach people how to program


00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.200
using these physical models as examples.


00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.640
And so they're getting some mathematics, not a ton,


00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.760
kind of a gentle introduction to differential equations,


00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.600
some physics, but it's a bit more broad


00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.920
'cause it's not just mechanics,


00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.660
and then some programming,


00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.960
but it's really a subset of programming


00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.920
that's focused on those domains.


00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.200
So that was my best explanation.


00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.440
- Oh, it's good, it's good.


00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.680
I can see how there's not a real great solution for that


00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.660
in a college curriculum, right?


00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.300
You send them off to take a CS class


00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.700
and they might come back of having done a introduction


00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.660
to programming course, but still not really


00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.860
be able to do too much, or an algorithms course.


00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.340
And I'm like, I can really tell you about a doubly linked list.


00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.420
You're like, all right, well, you're still not ready.


00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.060
I'm sorry.


00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.560
You know?


00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.060
Right?


00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.180
Like, it's a challenge to bring these things together.


00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.300
And I think that's generally a challenge in education a lot,


00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.900
is to cross these things over.


00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.340
And why a lot of people feel like certain things are--


00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.140
that's useless.


00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.980
I'll never use that.


00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.900
That doesn't have any value to me.


00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.260
because it's taught in such an abstract, isolated silo.


00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.660
- Yeah, and you never close the loop


00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.780
'cause we're making a promise.


00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.700
If we send a student to take a prerequisite class,


00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.340
the contract is you go do this thing,


00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.420
and then when you come back, we're gonna make it pay off.


00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:30.180
You're gonna see the benefit, and we never do.


00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.380
It never pays off.


00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.820
- It's tough, it's tough.


00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.780
So like we said, there's about 30 different problems in here


00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.260
like population growth, how long does it


00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.780
take for your coffee to cool, what's


00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.980
the optimal way to transfer it to work, glucose, disease


00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.820
modeling, as well as vaccines.


00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.740
People can check out.


00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.900
So I thought it might be fun for us to just pick out


00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.540
however many we get through.


00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.980
Let's say we take a shot at 10.


00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.460
We'll see if we get there.


00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.020
10 of these and just kind of talk through what


00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.420
the problem? What are some of the Python ideas at play here? Maybe what are some of the math or


00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:16.340
science ideas as well? So you want to start with world population? Sure. Yeah, this one was


00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:22.340
interesting for me. It's something I didn't know very much about. So I got to learn. And it, I


00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:28.100
think it's a sweet spot of you don't need a lot of computational tools, because this one comes very


00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:34.980
early in the book, but you can study a real system that's happening right now and get


00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.580
to understand it. So it's a discrete system, so we're just counting the number of people


00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:46.860
and modeling population growth. And so the number of new people in any year is going


00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:52.100
to be some function of the current population. And so we can introduce a couple of different


00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:57.720
models, you know, starting very simple. One of them says, what if we have the same number


00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.800
of births and deaths every year.


00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.040
Well, OK, the population would grow linearly, or maybe


00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.120
shrink linearly, but it would be linear growth, constant slope.


00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.200
All right, what if it's proportional?


00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.440
What if we have a birth rate that's


00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.640
proportional to the current population?


00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.360
Some people might know you're going to get exponential growth.


00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.280
And I think if you ask people what's


00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.080
going on in the world right now, they probably


00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.760
believe that we are experiencing exponential growth.


00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.280
That was my thought when I read this.


00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.800
I thought, oh, yeah, OK, so we're


00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.440
probably talking about geometric growth


00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.520
and those types of things, yeah.


00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.400
Right, right.


00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.400
Well, that's the model.


00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.600
And we try to fit that model to the data, and it doesn't.


00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.080
And so that's where the first lesson comes from,


00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.000
which is you can do all the theory you want,


00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.280
and eventually you will collide with data.


00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.560
And your theory may or may not survive the impact.


00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.800
And that's what happened here is the population


00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.520
is currently not growing exponentially,


00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:01.040
going back to about 1960, it's pretty close to linear.


00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.920
And that one's kind of weird, because, OK, wait a minute.


00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.680
If it's linear, that means we have


00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.760
roughly the same number of births and deaths every year.


00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.920
But how?


00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.280
How do you get 7 billion people to coordinate and make


00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.680
that happen?


00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.080
So there are a couple of ways to think about what's happening.


00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.020
One of them is the logistic growth model,


00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.020
which starts out exponential,


00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.900
and then as you approach a carrying capacity,


00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.900
you approach this limit,


00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.820
it approaches that limit asymptotically at the high end.


00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.420
And in the middle, there's a piece that looks linear.


00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.860
So you could look at that model and you could,


00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.260
okay, maybe that's what's going on,


00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.500
except it turns out that's not quite right either.


00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.940
And that's where the domain knowledge comes in.


00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.980
'Cause so far it's just been programming


00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.020
and looking at data, at some point


00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.500
you have to talk to a demographer


00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.300
because they actually know what's going on.


00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.900
And what's going on turns out to be very interesting.


00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.980
It's the demographic transition.


00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.420
And this is a social and economic phenomenon,


00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:11.540
which is as societies, countries become more economically


00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.660
developed and have more personal freedom,


00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.620
fertility rates tend to go down.


00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.780
And it's often dramatic.


00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:24.460
It would be a shift from lifetime fertility of five, six,


00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.820
seven, or eight children down to very close to two.


00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.140
And 2.1 is the replacement level where population levels off.


00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.340
A lot of developed countries right now


00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.860
are at or below replacement in terms of birth rate.


00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.180
And so their populations are leveling off


00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.260
or starting to decline.


00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.340
There's going to be some knock on economic effects, although I don't know that those


00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:54.940
were modeled in your book, but how does things like social security and support nets happen


00:22:54.940 --> 00:23:01.420
when the thing being supported is heavier or larger than the people doing the supporting,


00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.420
right?


00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.420
Right.


00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.540
Thinking of economies like Japan, for example, and so on.


00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.540
Yes.


00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.540
Yeah.


00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.060
They've been below replacement level for quite a while.


00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:14.220
So in some sense, they are the predictor of what a lot of other countries are looking


00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:21.340
like now. And as you said, you know, vast economic consequences. Now, that's where I


00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:27.900
stopped. It's not an economics book. But that's where it was, I think, fun for us to get to


00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:33.460
that point and say, look, okay, we have found some interesting things. And now, you know,


00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:38.060
go explore because there's a lot more to learn about this.


00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.580
Yeah, I doubt it would surprise the listeners that


00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.500
The standard data science pieces are at play here


00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.580
Jupyter notebooks


00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.700
Pandas matplotlib those kinds of things, right? Yeah, there it is


00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.460
from pandas read HTML


00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.860
Yes, whenever we can we try to get real data


00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.620
one of the goals of this class is to connect students to the real world and


00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:10.980
And that's one of the places where data science is a real opportunity because the availability of data is great.


00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:14.860
And the computational tools for working with data are very good.


00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:20.100
Now, obviously, in Python, Pandas is one of the popular libraries for data.


00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:25.380
There are others. But more generally, there's R, MATLAB.


00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:31.980
But this is a real, I think, teaching opportunity.


00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.560
One of the things I thought was interesting from a lot of these


00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:40.520
was the acquisition of the starter data for a lot of these.


00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.680
So for example, on this one, you're


00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.480
getting the world population estimates from a table.


00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.200
And I think this table originally comes from Wikipedia,


00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.640
but you've saved it locally because you're smart.


00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.640
And in case they change the format of that page,


00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.800
you don't have to rewrite your book.


00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.160
But it really highlights certain things


00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.240
that are just so easy if you know the way,


00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.480
but are not necessarily obvious.


00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.520
So for example, here you have from pandas import HTML.


00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.200
You can just go read HTML and you give it either a URL


00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.840
or just a HTML file in this case.


00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.760
And then you can say, well, we just want the second table


00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.200
that was in that HTML.


00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.840
And it literally grabs out of Wikipedia, it grabs the table and turns it into a


00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.120
pandas data frame, which is pretty remarkable, honestly.


00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:39.240
Yeah, well, I, you know, I have mixed feelings about this because it is it's


00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.880
OK, it's great that we can get the data and it's easy with these tools.


00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:49.680
It's a little bit sketchy in the sense that, you know, as you said, we have to


00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.960
what if Wikipedia changes the format?


00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.680
this is not exactly data that anybody intended to export.


00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.680
So I think I would prefer to get this data


00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.880
from the original source in a format


00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.960
that was really intended.


00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.520
An HTML table is not exactly a data transport format.


00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.380
- No, an Elm table, no, just kidding.


00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.760
I mean, it's fragile in a lot of ways.


00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.640
Somebody could insert a column, delete a column,


00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.240
more likely than insert one, right?


00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.840
To add, oh, we found a new data source.


00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.860
We added it and all of a sudden all of your stuff breaks.


00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.680
But it could even be as simple as,


00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.400
we added more information to the Wikipedia page


00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.400
and now there's a table that precedes this table in HTML.


00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.500
So when you say, get me the second table,


00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.320
you actually get some unrelated thing, right?


00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.120
So obviously, I mean, it's effectively web scraping


00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.200
behind the scenes, which is always fraught with instability.


00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.720
- But you're taking advantage of what Wikipedia did,


00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.480
which is to collate all of these sources.


00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.000
People have gathered this


00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.700
and curated this collection of data.


00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.080
So that's why I say mixed feelings


00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.840
'cause it is a great opportunity to take advantage of that,


00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.960
but web scraping might not be the best way to do it.


00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.840
- Yeah, quick question from Marwan.


00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.260
Does the book include attempts to visualize the simulations


00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.600
like modeling a bouncing ball becomes more rewarding


00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.400
if you can see it in action?


00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.940
- Definitely, and that comes up


00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.600
in the third part of the book,


00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.500
which is about mechanical systems.


00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.000
And those are the things where, yeah,


00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.140
we've got objects moving in space


00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.880
and that begs to be an animation.


00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.200
There's not a ton of it 'cause it's a little,


00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.580
the tools for animation in Jupyter Notebooks


00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.960
using Matplotlib are a little bit clumsy.


00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.120
So I didn't get deep into it,


00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.600
but definitely the point where you get to see the simulation


00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.320
and you see the objects moving in space,


00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.120
you, I think, appreciate it, for one thing.


00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.640
You also, I think, get to debug it


00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:01.600
because your eye is really good at seeing physical errors.


00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.880
If your physical model is doing something incorrect,


00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.620
it's gonna, you're gonna see it instantly.


00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.720
It's gonna bother you.


00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.360
- Yeah, that does look right.


00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.040
And, you know, it's probably not necessarily a problem


00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.600
with the animation, with the modeling,


00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.240
but even things like acceleration and deceleration,


00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.680
And if a thing just goes over and stops,


00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.520
you're like, oh, it didn't.


00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.920
That's not right, it shouldn't do that.


00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.160
It should slow down and come to a stop.


00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.320
It didn't hit an imaginary wall.


00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.360
All right, next one to talk about is epidemiology.


00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:36.360
And in this one, we talk about the freshman plague.


00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.480
People maybe with regard to college


00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.120
have heard of the freshman 15,


00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.480
like a certain amount of weight


00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.560
a lot of people seem to put on


00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.460
from the stress of going to college.


00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.100
But the freshman plague is more about


00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.460
coming together in a big group from all over the place


00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.960
more than maybe people are used to


00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.300
coming from their hometown.


00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:01.220
- Yeah, well, we started this example, well, let's see.


00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.980
I think we were working on this in 2017,


00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.220
but we were using this example previously.


00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.240
So before COVID is the point.


00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.940
And I guess at the time it was sort of a fun example,


00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.660
like, hey, everybody gets a cold


00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.340
during the first few weeks of the semester, ha ha.


00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.100
And it's less funny now, but it's also definitely more relevant


00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.780
that we're thinking about modeling an epidemic


00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.380
and modeling interventions, and in particular,


00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.540
understanding a concept like herd immunity.


00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.980
So if you're talking about public health


00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:41.180
and what's our civic obligation, it's not just looking


00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.340
after yourself.


00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.980
There is a public consequence to your individual decisions.


00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:54.380
Yeah, absolutely, there sure is. And yeah, this used to be somewhat of an interesting


00:29:54.380 --> 00:30:01.980
example and then it became one of the biggest stories, you know, maybe of our lifetimes,


00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:08.180
who knows. Anyway, so this is the Kermack-McKendrick model. And there's a couple of interesting


00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:13.880
things that I thought were interesting models here. So in this model, you have the susceptible


00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.400
folks who are not yet infected, but potentially could be.


00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.200
You have the recovered people and you assume


00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.400
they have some kind of immunity,


00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.040
at least for their freshman year, I guess.


00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.040
And then the people who are infected.


00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.680
And you talk about this idea of having,


00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.280
what's it called?


00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.160
Stock, yeah.


00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.400
Stock and flow diagrams.


00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.720
Those are pretty interesting 'cause you think


00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.240
of the freshman class as kind of a fixed set, right?


00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.000
Well, there are some different versions of the model.


00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.160
And right, Cormac McKendrick, nobody calls it that.


00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.280
Everybody just calls it an SIR model, because those are your three.


00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.280
And you can extend it.


00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.220
There are additional groups.


00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:05.100
And what you're modeling is the flow of, in this case, it's people from one stock to another.


00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.940
So someone who is susceptible, if they become infected,


00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:13.220
they move into the infectious stock.


00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.020
And when they recover, they move into recovered.


00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.900
So this is the simplest model, and usually it's


00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.460
a fixed population.


00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.180
The reason that this is where we start


00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:28.560
is that this lends itself to a differential equation


00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.580
that we can do some work with.


00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.300
We can't solve it analytically, but there


00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.340
or some useful analytic methods.


00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.260
And we can also work with it computationally.


00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.260
So this is one of several examples in the book


00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.580
where we do both.


00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.100
And that gives us a chance to show


00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:49.700
the strengths and weaknesses of analysis and computation,


00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.500
and also to do some validation by comparing the results


00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.140
from one and the other.


00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.140
So yeah, that's why this is where it is in the book.


00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:06.740
It's kind of the transition from the discrete systems in part one to the first order continuous systems.


00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:20.140
Yeah, okay. One of the things that I don't know, maybe I should have just known this or not, but was interesting to me was thinking about applying differential equations to a discrete set.


00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:26.700
Right. Like I think of just differential equations of being either applied to like maybe an interval,


00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:33.300
all of the real numbers or the complex numbers or, but not to 90 things, you know, which


00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:39.260
that, that, that was surprising. I thought, and then your ability to model that in Python


00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.260
was pretty cool.


00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:46.820
Yeah. So I'm glad, I'm glad you, you mentioned that because it's a really useful modeling


00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:51.540
method and it's a good example of the kind of modeling decisions that you're making all the


00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:57.300
time. And it can go in both directions. You can take something that you know is actually discreet


00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:03.300
like people and treat it as if it were continuous. And that works pretty well if you have a large


00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:08.100
population. Obviously, if you get down to very small numbers of people, it starts to break down.


00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:14.100
And that's where we can have a conversation about modeling and say, "Look, this is an


00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.540
an approximation, right?


00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.180
This isn't how the world really is.


00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:22.260
But I can pretend I can run the model,


00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.740
and those results can be useful even if the model isn't


00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.060
perfectly realistic.


00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.860
Because that's how models work.


00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.340
None of them are perfectly realistic.


00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:37.940
So I think one of the goals of the book


00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.140
is to engage the learner in those kinds of discussions


00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.500
about modeling decisions.


00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:48.780
Because I think that's missing in a lot of science classes.


00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:52.380
If you think about the traditional freshman physics


00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.660
class, you are told what the model is.


00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.860
So we're going to do a block on a frictionless plane.


00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.900
We're going to do a projectile moving in a vacuum.


00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.300
Well, the frictionless, that's a modeling decision.


00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.300
It says we're going to temporarily ignore friction


00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.900
in order to solve this problem.


00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:15.300
But you as the learner didn't get to make that decision.


00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:20.140
You're not required to figure out the consequences of it


00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:22.900
or think about when it doesn't apply.


00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.420
And that's what we really wanted to get at here.


00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.300
- Yeah, that's a really interesting point.


00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.580
And that's why a lot of people think


00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.940
math is just a bunch of formulas


00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.780
or hard sciences are often just a bunch of formulas.


00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.380
Then you just got to remember to use the formula


00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:47.220
because it just goes from this sterilized version, final version, without understanding,


00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:54.260
going from observation to making your way through it until you end up with something like this,


00:34:54.260 --> 00:35:00.820
right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a scary version of this, which is that it's not objective.


00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:07.060
Because if there's one answer, and your job is to figure out, you know, what, what's the right


00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:12.820
formula, apply the formula, get the answer at the back of the book. That's nice and objective.


00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:18.740
And we want our science to be objective, but regardless of what we want, it isn't,


00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:25.140
because it's based on modeling decisions. All science is based on modeling decisions,


00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:32.900
and those are subjective decisions. It's deciding whether a particular model is suitable for


00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.780
for purpose, depends on what you're trying to do.


00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.660
If you wanna make a general qualitative description


00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.920
of a system, maybe you can use a simple model.


00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.420
Maybe you can leave friction out of it.


00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.880
If you wanna land an orbiter on Mars,


00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:55.060
or a rover on Mars, you might need a more detailed model.


00:35:55.060 --> 00:36:00.420
- Yeah, if you're off by 1% of one degree,


00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.340
it's gonna matter by the time you get there.


00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.340
>> Yeah. >> Where is that playing in again?


00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.340
>> Yeah.


00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.340
>> Yeah. So in this one, you talk through using this,


00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.340
a couple of types and ideas in here with states and systems.


00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.340
And it sounds like in the book, it looks like in the book,


00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:19.340
you provided some foundational building blocks


00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:25.340
for modeling the modSim module, right?


00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.340
So in addition to just having the books,


00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.340
you've got a bunch of Jupyter notebooks that people can check out.


00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:36.340
and as well as some code to kind of help this modeling here.


00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.740
You want to talk a bit about that?


00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:40.580
- Sure.


00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:45.260
So this was my attempt to use some programming ideas


00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.800
to communicate modeling ideas by creating these objects.


00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.500
So one of them is a state object


00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.860
and it represents the state of a system.


00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.740
So if you think about an object moving through space,


00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.220
it has position and velocity.


00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.140
And at any point in time, if I write down


00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.340
the position and velocity, that's


00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.900
the state of that object.


00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.980
So in object-oriented programming,


00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.660
that begs to be an object.


00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.380
It is a state object that contains position and velocity.


00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:21.420
Now, under the hood, it is a pandas series


00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:26.500
that is mapping from names to values.


00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.380
Similarly with a system object, that's


00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.900
actually a Python namespace.


00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.700
So there are a couple of different things,


00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.340
but this one's a namespace.


00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.660
And it represents everything that you


00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.420
need to know about a system in order to model it.


00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.020
So it'll be the parameters of the system.


00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.660
If it's, let's take that projectile moving in space


00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.180
again, it might be mass, cross-sectional area,


00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:52.460
coefficient of drag, density of air, temperature of air,


00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.340
all the things to model.


00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.620
One of the examples is like a baseball in flight.


00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.740
- Yeah, so excellent.


00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.300
So this one you go through, you model,


00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.660
you run the simulation over time


00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.940
and eventually end up with a graph that shows,


00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.780
you know, a little over half of the students got lucky


00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.220
and didn't get the plague,


00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.760
but about half of them dead at some point


00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.420
throughout the year or the semester, whatever it was.


00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:22.180
- Right, so that's, you can do a single run


00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:26.900
in order to simulate a hypothetical course of the disease.


00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.700
And now you can start to vary the parameters and say,


00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.820
what if the disease is more infectious?


00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.740
What if the recovery time is longer or shorter?


00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.660
What if people start washing their hands?


00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.340
And what if we start vaccinating them?


00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.580
And so by varying the parameters now,


00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.300
you can see how the output of the model


00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.120
depends on the system parameters.


00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.940
And that's where another one of these objects comes in.


00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.900
We have a thing that's called a sweep series,


00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.300
And it's a mapping from a hypothetical parameter


00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.120
to the output of the model using that parameter.


00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:09.180
- Yeah, when you hear people talking about COVID,


00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.500
I remember them talking about the infection rate,


00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.020
and is it bigger than one, is it less than one?


00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:20.020
And all of those things were very relevant here, right?


00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:25.420
- Right, yes, the R0 and R, the contact rate.


00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:30.420
And that term comes straight out of this model.


00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.780
That is the ratio of the two parameters here.


00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:37.820
So beta is the rate of infection,


00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.780
depending on how many people are susceptible


00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.500
and how many are infected.


00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.140
And gamma is the rate of recovery,


00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.560
which is the fraction of infected people


00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.340
who recover in a unit of time.


00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:53.100
And the ratio of those two things is the contact rate,


00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.940
the R0.


00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:54.780
- Yep.


00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.220
All right, well, way more relevant these days


00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.220
than it was a few years ago.


00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.940
- Oh yeah, we all know a lot more about epidemiology


00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:02.780
than we used to.


00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.140
(laughing)


00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.620
- We sure do.


00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.740
My daughter was just enjoying going back


00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.620
and watching some of her favorite YouTubers videos


00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.020
from February and March of 2020.


00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.100
Just laughing, they were saying,


00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.660
"Oh, it looks like we're gonna have to stay home


00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.500
for a week."


00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.100
And she's just like, "They have no idea.


00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:20.940
They have no idea."


00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:21.780
Okay.


00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.620
All right.


00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.060
All right, let's go on to something more fun.


00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.720
One of my favorite things, coffee.


00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.560
- Good one.


00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.400
- Yeah, awesome.


00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.900
And so tell us about the coffee cooling problem


00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.900
that you solve here.


00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.680
- This one's a classic.


00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:42.680
The source that I'm aware of is a Martin Gardner column


00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.360
in Scientific American.


00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.240
And it posed this question,


00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.420
which is if I get my coffee and I also have some milk


00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.180
and I'm planning to add the milk to the coffee.


00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.980
Should I add it now and so that they cool down together


00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.580
or should I drive to my destination?


00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.260
Let's suppose you're commuting.


00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.540
Should I get to my destination and then mix them


00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.460
with the goal of getting the coffee


00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.900
down to a pleasantly drinkable temperature


00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.200
as quickly as possible?


00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.860
- Okay.


00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.940
Yeah, you pick it up,


00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.180
maybe hit one of those drive-thru coffee shack things


00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.500
that's just stands on its own.


00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.140
And you're like, "Oh, it's always too hot here.


00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.940
How should I do this so that I can basically


00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.020
have a perfect coffee when I arrive where I'm going?"


00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:29.860
Right?


00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.680
- Yep.


00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.020
- Okay, excellent.


00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.740
So this one involves Newton's law of cooling, right?


00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.620
Did I get that right?


00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:38.740
- You got it.


00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.260
- And the heat transfer, there we go.


00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.420
Newton's law of cooling.


00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:45.100
Another differential equation here,


00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.140
as they want to be in simulation.


00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:48.980
- Yes, right.


00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:53.100
So this is another one which is a first order differential equation.


00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:59.020
And you can do it two ways, which is you can break it up into discrete steps in time.


00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:03.300
And so your differential equation becomes a difference equation.


00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:09.300
And that's a natural thing for a programming language, because now it's a loop.


00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.740
And during each time step, you figure out the difference between the coffee and the


00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.120
environment.


00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:20.080
tells you the rate of change, and then that lets you make a prediction for the next time step.


00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:27.040
And so if you repeat that process, that is Euler's method for solving differential equations.


00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:34.000
So there's kind of a natural transition there. And then I think for this problem, we don't yet


00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.960
use the ODE solver, but then later in the book we do. And that's trying to motivate,


00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.800
why are we using this library? Well, you know, there are limits to Euler's method. At some point,


00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:52.320
it's not very accurate. Yeah, it might not be accurate enough, for sure. And ODE, Ordinary


00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.120
Differential Equations, for people out there listening. You got it right. Thank you. Ordinary


00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:04.960
differential equation. And so, you know, Python has, you know, SciPy, SciPy has several functions


00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.360
that will solve differential equations for you. And so we're kind of, we're sneaking up on that.


00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:15.760
Yeah, okay. It is interesting that you can say, yeah, sure, it's a differential equation, and


00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:22.480
those might sound scary and hard to solve and all those kinds of things. But you can subtract two


00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:27.520
numbers. You can do a simple thing and looping is good. And so if you just make your loop have


00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.880
small enough increments, you're kind of doing the same thing that, you know, taking the limit to get


00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:39.440
to calculus does anyway, right? Yeah, we're kind of, we're short circuiting what I think of as a


00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:45.360
a really unnecessary loop, which is there's a lot of physical modeling where you take


00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:51.520
a system, you write a differential equation, but then you can't actually do anything with


00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.800
that differential equation. You can't solve it. And so you're going to have to use numerical


00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:02.640
methods anyway. And if you look at what the numerical method is doing, it's basically


00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:08.200
Euler's method. It's, you know, they're more complicated versions, but it's the same idea.


00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.320
We're going to take time, we're going to break it up


00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:15.520
into discrete steps, and we're basically simulating the system.


00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.520
So what we do in the book is cut out the middle man


00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.480
and go straight to simulation.


00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.840
There's almost no reason to write a differential equation


00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.000
if you can't solve it.


00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.320
You might as well just start with a simulation.


00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.240
Yeah.


00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.680
So what's the story with the coffee?


00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.000
How should I approach this?


00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.400
I'm not gonna give it away.


00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.720
- People gotta earn it.


00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.040
They gotta come figure it out, huh?


00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.500
You do have at the end.


00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:49.060
So one of the big challenges here is not like,


00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.040
how soon in my trip should I get the coffee?


00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.180
How long should I let it sit?


00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.980
Or any of those kinds of things.


00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:58.300
It's one of the important parts is you have milk or cream


00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.380
you wanna put into the coffee.


00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.300
You should decide if you put it into the hot coffee,


00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.940
the cold cream right away, that starts it somewhere


00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.660
other than if you maybe wait till you get to the office


00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:09.900
and then mix the cream.


00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:15.800
So people can come back and solve that about the milk.


00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.060
- Right.


00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.500
Now, here's a question.


00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.700
This came up, one of the people I chat with on Twitter


00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.300
posed this question, it's a variation of this.


00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.420
He said he was disagreeing with his wife


00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.640
about using an electric kettle.


00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.220
The question is, let's say that you heat up


00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:39.760
You know the kettle full of water you use half of it and now the other half is there


00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.380
You have a stay warm feature


00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:50.140
Where you can set the kettle so that it keeps the water at let's say tea making temperature for you


00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:56.780
Or you can shut it off. Let it cool down and then later on when you want to make tea heat it up again


00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:03.140
Now let's leave out of it for now that the time that it would take to heat up again


00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:06.940
Let's say you don't you don't care about that. You just want to know about energy consumption. Is


00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:14.940
It better to keep the water hot or let it cool down and then you have to use all that energy to heat it up again


00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:23.680
Do you want to you want to get my my my guess is better to let it cool down because the


00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.940
wider temperature


00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:29.740
gradient you keep between the ambient air and the water,


00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:33.500
the higher rate of loss of temperature,


00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.580
which you actually had a really interesting


00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.860
piece, tidbit of information here.


00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.900
You said, okay, if the coffee cools from, you know,


00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.460
cooking temperature down to drinking temperature,


00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.620
that's a ton of energy.


00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.980
It says to give you a sense,


00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.180
if you were able to harness all of that heat to do work,


00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.540
but you can't because of inefficiencies of engines.


00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.300
But if somehow you had a magic levitating engine


00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:04.240
that converted heat energy to potential energy,


00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:10.260
you could use this lost energy to lift the cup of coffee


00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.860
from sea level to 8,500 meters


00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:14.820
just under the height of Mount Everest.


00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.820
That's an insane amount of energy when you think about it.


00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:18.660
- That is.


00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.820
And honestly, I did this calculation 10 times


00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.220
and I'm still not sure.


00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.500
- It's gotta be wrong.


00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.100
- No, it's awesome.


00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:26.940
I love it.


00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.900
- I believe that this is true,


00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.100
but if someone contradicts me, I would be grateful


00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.380
because I just wanna know.


00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.620
But at least according to the calculation I did,


00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:40.780
the difference between mechanical energy and heat energy


00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.360
is just, it defies your intuition.


00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:49.380
And it's really, it's thermodynamics that is the difference


00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.300
because to take something from sea level


00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:59.520
to the top of Mount Everest is organized energy and heat is disorganized energy


00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:03.120
and what that means is you know you can have you can have quite a lot of heat


00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:09.180
and not be able to do much work with it because it's disorganized. Yeah okay


00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:14.860
excellent. Before we move off this one I remember you were I think it might have


00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.660
also been Scientific American but there was a debate about coffee of whether


00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:24.140
they're blowing on it, if it was the cool air hitting the water that would cool it,


00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:28.180
if it was just the evaporation. And someone did an experiment where they


00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:33.380
they put a fan on it with cool background air and they put a hair dryer


00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:37.820
with hot air blowing on it and it's still it's the evaporation. It's like


00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:42.220
these state changes and this energy of this heat loss, it's pretty powerful.


00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:48.540
Yeah, the latent heat of vaporization is a huge number, which is


00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.820
is good because that's what keeps us cool.


00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.020
That's why sweat works.


00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:54.700
That's right.


00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.220
That's right.


00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.340
It's good.


00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.760
We're coming up on summer, so we're


00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.420
going to appreciate that, I'm sure.


00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.820
All right, on to the next one.


00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:04.460
Limits to growth.


00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:07.100
Tell me about this one.


00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.100
Yeah, so this is related to the population growth


00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.820
that we were talking about earlier.


00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:18.140
And this is developing the logistic growth model,


00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.260
But then trying to figure out, is that really what's going on?


00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:25.020
Is human population leveling off because we


00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.620
are hitting resource limits?


00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:32.240
Like, are we running out of food or other resources?


00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.780
And the answer for now is no.


00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.340
I mean, we can certainly look at places in the world


00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.840
where resources are scarce, but that's not


00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.620
what's limiting growth.


00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:43.860
Interestingly, it's almost the opposite.


00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:47.060
It is the places that are most economically developed,


00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.620
where resources are most available,


00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.660
where fertility rates are--


00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:52.500
- That's a good point, yeah.


00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.540
- The fastest.


00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:57.660
- Okay.


00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.580
- And it's not being driven by death rate.


00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:00.940
That's the other thing.


00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.100
I think the other reason that we know


00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:07.800
that what we're seeing is not a resource limit


00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.060
because that would drive up the death rate.


00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.980
- Yeah.


00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:12.800
- And that's not the case.


00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.640
death rate is dropping at all ages in all places.


00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.800
Well, with a few exceptions.


00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.480
Yeah, of course.


00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.280
So this one's kind of about finding that equilibrium.


00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:30.200
Yeah, so this is taking the model to its limit


00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.640
and saying, OK, if we use the logistic model,


00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.320
even though we think physically this isn't exactly what's


00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.920
happening, can we make a prediction


00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:42.200
about where we think world population will level off


00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.220
and possibly even start to fall.


00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.820
And one thing that surprised me is that


00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:52.200
even though this model is very simple and not realistic,


00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:57.120
the predictions that come out of it are not wildly different


00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.200
from what we're getting from real demographers.


00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:04.920
So the UN and the US census both have projections


00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:08.000
for world population out to about 2100.


00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:11.460
And they predict world population


00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:15.420
will probably level off around 2100


00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:19.060
at somewhere between nine and 11 billion people.


00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:24.140
And this very simple model is not too far off from that.


00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:25.320
- Yeah, okay.


00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.720
- That's a pretty wide range.


00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.620
(both laughing)


00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.500
A lot of things can happen.


00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.340
- Yeah, sure.


00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:36.260
A lot of assumptions and current equilibrium might change.


00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.980
Like for example, climate change.


00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.580
Who knows what that does?


00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:40.780
Yep.


00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:41.300
That's big.


00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.260
But right now, the biggest drivers


00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:48.300
are the indices of world development.


00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.300
If you look at things like health and especially


00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:55.140
child mortality, when child mortality is low,


00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.460
fertility goes down.


00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.220
And it's counterintuitive.


00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.740
But to some extent, people are having,


00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.140
let's say, enough children.


00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:09.220
And if your children have a very high chance of survival,


00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.460
enough is a smaller number.


00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.620
It's a funny way of looking at it.


00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:17.460
So health, economic opportunity, human rights


00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:21.460
is one of the other big driving forces.


00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.860
Right, autonomy.


00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:28.340
Yeah, freedom to make reproductive decisions.


00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:30.220
And education, that's the other big one.


00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.340
Yep.


00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:32.860
Yep.


00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:38.340
OK, another one from the health area, glucose and insulin.


00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.380
Yeah, what's the problem we're solving here?


00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.700
So this is a model of the system in our bodies,


00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.620
and actually I think all mammals,


00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.340
to regulate blood sugar.


00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.820
And it's the interaction of glucose, or blood sugar,


00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.980
and the hormones that cause blood sugar to go up and down,


00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:58.620
the primary one being insulin.


00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:01.940
And there's a model that's called the minimal model.


00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.640
And it was proposed by researchers


00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.420
who were trying to describe, what's


00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:09.700
the minimum set of interactions that we


00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:14.380
need in order to have a model that fits the data pretty well?


00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.580
And this is an example that I liked,


00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:19.740
partly because the discussion of modeling


00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:25.220
was so explicit that there are some quotes from these papers


00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:30.060
where they are more open about their thinking than usual.


00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:37.100
it seems like people kind of hide the models. And these guys were really thinking about what do we


00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:43.500
need to include? And what can we leave out? And how do we evaluate whether the model is good enough?


00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:52.140
And the way they did good enough is they actually had data from studies of blood sugar and diabetes,


00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:59.820
where people have a challenge test, they are actually injected with glucose solution.


00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:04.020
and then they monitor their insulin levels


00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.820
and blood sugar levels over three hours


00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:11.300
with measurements every two minutes.


00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:14.100
And so you can see blood sugar goes up


00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:18.060
and then insulin goes up and then glucose comes down


00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.740
and then insulin comes down


00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.840
and then you eventually get back, if everything works,


00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:27.840
to your steady state base levels where you started.


00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:32.780
- I see, so if you don't have diabetes,


00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.060
your body should react that way,


00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.180
but maybe if you do,


00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.140
like it can't produce the insulin to counterbalance that


00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.840
or something like this, right?


00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.200
So I think I've heard of that as a test


00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.540
for seeing if you have,


00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:48.020
either have diabetes or maybe are pre-diabetic, right?


00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.500
- Yep, exactly.


00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.340
And there are two things.


00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.620
You might not be producing enough insulin


00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:56.940
or your cells might be insensitive to it.


00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.280
So there are two ways that that can go wrong.


00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.040
- Okay.


00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:04.840
So I think, I don't remember which one


00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.680
that you did this on here.


00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.360
There's all, all of these come with great slots over time


00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.840
and you're running the simulation


00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.120
and seeing how it evolves over time


00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.520
and those kinds of things.


00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:21.420
But at least one of these you used SymPy, right?


00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:23.600
- Yes.


00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.640
- SymPy is pretty interesting.


00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.700
- Yeah, so this is symbolic computation


00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:32.700
and it allows you to solve systems equations,


00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:39.060
non-linear equations, differential equations,


00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:42.100
at least for the ones that have an analytic solution,


00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:44.580
SymPy will often find it for you.


00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:47.420
And when I say find a solution,


00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.580
it's not a numerical approximation,


00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:52.260
it's a symbolic representation of the function.


00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.940
- Right, that's why I thought it was so interesting


00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:55.780
as a thing.


00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:58.260
'Cause so everything we've been talking about so far


00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.900
are like these Euler type solutions where you're like,


00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.620
okay, well, if we just approximate,


00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:05.420
if the gap is small enough, it's like calculus,


00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.740
but it's a loop, you know?


00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:08.860
Whereas this says,


00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:13.580
actually the integral of this differential equation


00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.760
is this other formula, right?


00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:19.060
Like you would learn in calculus or something.


00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.060
- Yep.


00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:22.460
Yeah, and so what you get is this object


00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.200
that represents the function,


00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.040
and you can render it as LaTeX.


00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.660
So you can kind of see it, you know,


00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:30.540
with the nice integral symbols


00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:32.880
and infinity symbols and all that.


00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:36.180
And you can also from that generate Python code.


00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.100
So you could have, you know,


00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:40.460
solve your differential equation


00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:45.460
and then evaluate the result as a numerical computation.


00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:49.980
- Right, the answer, instead of being 3.14,


00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:52.220
whatever is just the letter Pi.


00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.060
- Right.


00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.900
You gave me a formula.


00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:58.660
Here's the actual symbolic solution to it as a number, right?


00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.700
>> Yeah.


00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.780
>> Yeah, pretty cool. I believe you use that in


00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.420
some of your simulations or some of your models, right?


00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.860
>> There were a couple of examples where we did both.


00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.940
We would do the numerical solver and


00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:16.300
then the symbolic computation and then compare them.


00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:20.200
Then a couple of places where there's an analysis that you can do,


00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:28.040
like the SIR model, where you could do the analysis by hand, and certainly in lots of


00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:33.000
science and math classes, that's what you would do. But I really wanted to show people how to do


00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:40.360
this symbolically, because I think it separates two parts of the activity. There's the low-level


00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:46.120
activity of actually writing all the symbols on paper and being very careful not to leave off the


00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.480
the minus signs and the two, you know, factor of two and all that.


00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:53.960
And then there's the high level, keeping track of what am I doing?


00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.000
What's my goal?


00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.880
What are the steps I'm following to get there?


00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:02.600
And I think symbolic computation has a lot of potential to separate those two,


00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:07.440
where I think people could come away with a much better understanding


00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.720
of that high level stuff if they are freed


00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:15.320
from so much of their attention being on the low level stuff.


00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:20.320
- Yeah, yeah, just the grind of factoring polynomials


00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:25.320
or taking the derivative or whatever, right?


00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.480
- Yep, yep.


00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.480
But you see, you know, mechanical systems,


00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.440
if you're working with physical vectors,


00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.880
you just, you have a page that's just full of sines


00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:35.020
and cosines.


00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:39.640
And it's, in some sense, what that is,


00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:42.220
is a failure of notation.


00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.320
because that page full of sines and cosines


00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:48.480
is really telling you that you have not represented


00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:52.080
the computation in an effective way.


00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:58.200
That the sines and cosines are a consequence


00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.480
of not using vector arithmetic.


00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:06.920
- Right, which you do make a big use of


00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:10.600
with pandas and things like that, right?


00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.080
- Right, we get to it.


00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:16.120
And this is, I think, where I started to reach the limits


00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.620
of the current tools.


00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:23.480
Because ideally, if you have vector quantities,


00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:27.280
like position and velocity and acceleration,


00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.560
you should represent them as vectors.


00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.840
And so when you add two vectors,


00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:36.660
you're not converting them to their coordinates,


00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:37.760
adding the coordinates,


00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.040
and then putting the result back into a vector.


00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:45.040
You just think of vector addition as a fundamental operation.


00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:48.320
But in the same way, we would like to be able to


00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:53.320
do differentiation and numerical solution to these methods


00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:58.540
also using vectors as primitive objects.


00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.080
And we're not quite there.


01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.880
The SciPy libraries don't really do that.


01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.960
So I end up doing a lot of packing and unpacking


01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.560
where I start with vectors,


01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.360
but then to do the computation,


01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.840
I have to break them down into coordinates.


01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.480
And then when I get the result,


01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.420
I have to stuff it back into vectors.


01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.940
I think the next generation of scientific computing,


01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:26.220
we need vectors as basic types


01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:28.520
and we need computation with units.


01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:32.480
- Yeah, right.


01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.000
Which is something that's also often missing, right?


01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.240
To my knowledge, this does not exist in Python


01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.480
or any other programming language that's not,


01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.480
at least that is mainstream.


01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.560
There are probably some engineering ones,


01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.660
but we have things like Pint, right?


01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.520
- Yeah.


01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.040
- It's a pretty neat library.


01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.720
- It's very neat and it's very close to what I want.


01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.400
AstroPy is the other library I'm aware of


01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.520
that does a really good job with units.


01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.520
And I've played around with each of them


01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.280
enough to be excited for the potential,


01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.760
but also to have hit a wall of,


01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.760
I still can't quite do what I want.


01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.360
Ideally, it should be end-to-end.


01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.480
I should be able to start with the parameters of my system


01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:22.880
and the initial state described using vectors with units,


01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.960
and then run the whole computation so that at the end,


01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.920
my result is in the form of vectors with units.


01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.200
Yeah.


01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.640
And that's not easy yet.


01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.480
Yeah, not yet.


01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.560
OK.


01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.380
you know, the, the SimPy stuff is a little, a little like that


01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:47.640
in the sense that the thing you get back is an, is it like kind


01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.120
of a function in the mathematical sense, like f of x


01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:55.060
equals, you know, e to the x, and you can compose them and


01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.560
pass them around, right? And sort of use them a little bit


01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.120
more than just, well, I got an answer out of this. And then I


01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.560
feed the answer there, right? Numerically.


01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:10.320
Yes. So it's in PI is end to end in this way that you start with symbols and you end with symbols.


01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:16.440
There's no like in between where you have to break it down into numerical methods and then build it up again.


01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:27.160
So yeah, I think SymPy has achieved this goal. And we're still I think, working on vectors and units and scientific computation.


01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.720
Yeah, absolutely.


01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:33.040
All right, well, we're pretty close to out of time.


01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:39.440
But I think maybe let's just touch on one more kind of fun.


01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.560
Fun one.


01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.000
Watch, I've got to find my way down here.


01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.200
And that is-- people can go and play with this.


01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.520
That's the bungee dunk.


01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.160
Do you want to tell people what kind of insanity a bungee dunk


01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:54.520
is?


01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.520
And then you can just talk about this modeling problem.


01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:03.360
As a way to say some human being put their body in jeopardy to test this theory.


01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:10.720
Right? Tell us about this. Yes. Okay. So this was partly prompted by this video, which shows a


01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.760
person doing a bungee jump. So they're jumping off a crane, they have a bungee cord attached to their


01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:23.440
ankles. And when the cord is stretched out and fully extended, they are about four feet from


01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:30.440
the ground and they can reach out and the person jumping has a cookie or a biscuit because


01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:36.720
they're in the UK and they dunk the cookie into a cup of tea that is on a dock at the


01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:42.280
bottom of this and I forget the number was it 30 meters but it was a world yeah there


01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.920
is something like that yeah it was way too far for a person to do that with their body


01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:53.100
now so this is the video shows them literally they come to a complete stop because the way


01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:58.780
the springs work and they are right at where they they literally do dunk this biscuit into the tee


01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:04.380
and then shoot back up for the back and forth oscillation of hook by hooks law of the bungee


01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:11.340
right you got it right now the margin of error here is low when most people when they do a bungee


01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:18.860
jump do not do this because if it just turns out that he had extended about two meters more than


01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:23.020
than he expected to, he would have at least hit the plank


01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.900
and he was over a body of water.


01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:26.700
So maybe it's not a catastrophe,


01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.760
but it was a risky thing to do.


01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.140
- Yeah.


01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.820
At a minimum, it's gonna hurt.


01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:33.660
- Yes.


01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.860
(laughing)


01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.780
- Yeah, so you basically, you go through the idea of like,


01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:42.780
well, if you wanted to try, the record was 70 meters.


01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.780
- Oh, okay.


01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.760
- So that is way up there.


01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.000
So that's way up there.


01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.080
So if you wanted to say, you know what,


01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.200
guy with a cool beard that currently holds


01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.760
the Guinness Book of World Records,


01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.920
we have pandas, we have notebooks, we're gonna beat this.


01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:03.760
You could go through and model all the details out


01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.180
and you talk through some of the assumptions


01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:08.720
like the bungee will not apply a slowing force to you


01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:12.820
until it fully extends the slack length of the bungee


01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:16.820
and then it is a perfect spring and on and on, right?


01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.780
- Right.


01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.340
But here's where there is some interesting physics.


01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:23.180
So here's the other motivation for this problem.


01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:25.940
Remember, thinking about modeling decisions,


01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:29.100
what can you leave out and what do you have to include


01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.060
in order to get a precise answer?


01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:33.140
So in this scenario,


01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.140
like air resistance is definitely a factor.


01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.980
And the stretch of the spring


01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.900
and its restoring force is definitely a factor.


01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:45.580
But here's the interesting part.


01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.940
During the first phase of the jump,


01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.620
while the bungee cord is not yet stretching,


01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:53.620
but it is uncoiling,


01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.980
because it starts out in a great big U shape,


01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.560
it's dangling down,


01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:03.500
and it has to unravel or unwrap itself as you are falling.


01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:07.340
The first model that you probably think of


01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.340
is that it's just free fall,


01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.620
that you are being pulled by the force of gravity


01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:17.020
and the bungee cord is being pulled by the force of gravity.


01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:20.380
And so there's no net interaction between the two.


01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:22.020
And so you would think it would be just,


01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.380
your acceleration would be equal to G,


01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.500
you know, 9.8 meters per second squared.


01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:30.260
And that's what turns out not to be true.


01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.640
And it's not at all obvious,


01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.340
but there is an interaction with the cord.


01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.940
It is transferring momentum from the cord to you.


01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:41.680
It's an alias to a whip action.


01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:46.020
And the net effect is that you accelerate faster than gravity


01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:48.460
because the cord is actually pulling you down.


01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:54.420
And it turns out that the difference you would be off by,


01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:56.340
if you ignore this effect,


01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:59.420
you would be off by about two meters, which is-


01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.580
- And that's gonna be a problem.


01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.780
- That was your margin of error.


01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:04.620
Right.


01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.440
So there's a nice physics paper that explains this.


01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.920
And there's a really nice Veritasium video


01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.880
that explains the phenomenon


01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.560
and does a really compelling demonstration


01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.860
that shows that it's true.


01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:24.000
- Veritasium is fantastic for this kind of stuff.


01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.140
It's a YouTube channel that does these kinds of experiments.


01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:30.240
- Yeah.


01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.720
- A little bit like the Discovery Show, but way better.


01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.280
- They're really good.


01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.160
- Yeah.


01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.920
Did you see the downwind sort of sailboat, a sail car?


01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.120
- No, I don't.


01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.600
Oh, maybe I did actually see that.


01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.000
Yeah, I think I did.


01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:45.840
- That one's very good.


01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.680
- It's been a while.


01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.800
Yeah, I'll see if I can find the channel


01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.000
and put it up in the show notes for people.


01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.240
All right, I think with that,


01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.560
we probably should call it for time,


01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.520
but very interesting.


01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.600
People don't actually recommend you go try


01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.680
to break the bungee dunk record.


01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.520
- Yeah, no.


01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.480
- It is fun to watch.


01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.980
- Yeah, make a good model.


01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:14.520
- Exactly, make a good model and let us know.


01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.200
We'll share it, but we don't recommend it.


01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.200
All right, final two questions before we get out of here,


01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.520
Alan, if you're gonna write some Python code,


01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.480
what editor do you use?


01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:28.280
- I'm using mostly Jupyter Notebooks,


01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:31.320
but also a little bit of VS Code.


01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.600
- Okay, for notebooks, is it straight Jupyter


01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.600
or is it JupyterLab?


01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.200
I just had JupyterLab 4.0 come out, which is a big update.


01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.720
- I know, and every time JupyterLab gets better,


01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.320
I think now's the time for me to make the switch,


01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.880
but I have not.


01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.600
And partly it's familiarity,


01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.960
and partly as a teaching environment,


01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:52.880
I prefer a simple environment with a minimum distraction.


01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.720
- Sure, that's certainly valid.


01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.840
All right, then notable PyPI package,


01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.200
Conda package if you prefer.


01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.760
- Right, well, I have to say


01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.600
the SciPy, NumPy, Pandas,


01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.140
those were the primary things I was using for this book.


01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:14.180
And then maybe a shout out to Pint, which I, you know,


01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.460
as I said, I think it's not quite doing everything I want,


01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.140
but I think it's a really great tool.


01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.180
- Excellent. Yeah, I agree.


01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.440
All right, people are interested.


01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.700
They want to check out your book.


01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.060
I'll put the link in the show notes.


01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:31.900
There's Jupyter Notebooks up on Google Colab.


01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.400
If you're feeling brave,


01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.400
you can create your own virtual environment,


01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.280
install them locally and run them there as well.


01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:39.540
That works too.


01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:40.380
- Yep.


01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:41.200
- Anything else you wanna say?


01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.800
How people get started with this book?


01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.880
- The idea is to just get you into it.


01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.480
There are some case studies and a lot of chances


01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.760
to take whatever system you're interested in


01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.160
and apply these tools.


01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.360
So I hope people enjoy it.


01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:58.300
And if you do anything interesting with it, let me know.


01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.320
- Sounds good.


01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.720
Well, thank you for being here


01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.320
And thanks to everyone for listening.


01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:04.820
>> Thank you.
