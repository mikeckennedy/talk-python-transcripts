00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
- Hello everyone out there on the live stream.


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.640
Hey Paul, hey Barry.


00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.920
- Hey. - Hello.


00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.000
- Hey, great to have you both here.


00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.040
Those of you on YouTube,


00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.180
please drop your comments and thoughts in the live chat


00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.180
and we'll try to make it part of your show.


00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.320
And yeah, without further ado, let's kick this off.


00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.520
Barry and Paul, welcome to Talk Python to Me.


00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.440
- Thanks for having us.


00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.440
- Thanks for having us.


00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.880
- Yeah, it's super to have you both here.


00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.840
Now, Paul, you've been on the show before


00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.320
and we've talked about a few things.


00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.040
Barry, I don't think I've had you on Talk Python,


00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.840
but we had both of you on Python Bytes at a live PyCon.


00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.680
You guys remember that?


00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.280
People got in a room.


00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.560
No one was like frightened when you would get


00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.400
somewhat near them, they wouldn't run away.


00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.760
It was great.


00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.160
- Good times.


00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.000
- Those were good times.


00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.400
- That was a lot of energy


00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.800
back before you did live virtually.


00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.920
Is that what you call this?


00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.120
- VLive, something like that, yeah.


00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.160
- Yeah, that was really cool.


00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.840
I mean, we had that at the PyCharm booth actually.


00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.000
We had like the whole broadcast thing going on there.


00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.920
It was a lot of fun.


00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.760
We'll do it again.


00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.200
- Yeah, it really was. - We'll get back to this.


00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.520
I mean, I don't know how you two feel about it,


00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.040
but to me, PyCon and similar events,


00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.240
that's like my geek holiday.


00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.040
I get away and I get to learn stuff


00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.560
and make professional connections,


00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.920
but I also get to see all my friends


00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.320
from all around the world and just share stories


00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.240
and have a beer with them


00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.360
when I would just never otherwise see them.


00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.880
- Yeah.


00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.640
Yeah, I was just talking about this recently,


00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.560
of course, missing PyCon in person,


00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.840
but I think what I learned for me,


00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.960
at least the hack of PyCon,


00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.960
which was realizing that all the great talks were online


00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.800
and there was still a few that I would go to,


00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.640
but where all the real value for me at PyCon was,


00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.400
was talking to people, the hallway conversations,


00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.000
the energy and the synergy of ideas.


00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.880
Oh, you're looking into that.


00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.920
I'm looking into this.


00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.240
Look how that stuff goes together.


00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.160
So that to me was really the value of PyCon in person.


00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.360
- Yeah, I totally agree.


00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.240
That's why I would go as well.


00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.480
- My best part is walking down the hallway with Barry


00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.240
and watching thousands of people come up and say,


00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.800
"Oh my God, Barry, I love you so much."


00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.640
- No.


00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.400
Now, now-


00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.560
- I mean, every continent, Barry is loved.


00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.720
- Oh my gosh.


00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.720
This is not my normal BS.


00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.160
This is actually literally true.


00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.280
- Like real BS.


00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.920
You know, it's really, really funny.


00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.760
'Cause, you know, walking around with Guido,


00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.880
and Guido is the rockstar of the Python community


00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.480
in a lot of ways, of course.


00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.600
And I always felt like I was playing my bass player role


00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.160
in Python too, it was great.


00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.360
- Oh yeah, yeah.


00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.040
- I'm just back here doing my thing.


00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.440
- That's perfect, that's exactly right.


00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.000
- A beautiful supporting role right there.


00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.840
- Yeah, exactly.


00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.920
- In the music line.


00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.640
So, fantastic.


00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.640
Oh, we're gonna get back to these conferences


00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.800
and these get togethers.


00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.680
I know we will.


00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.000
And I'm even gonna try to get the most


00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.320
out of the online events.


00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.000
Like I registered for PyCon and I'm looking forward to it.


00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.040
I'm gonna try to make the most of it.


00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.480
Now, before we get into the main topic,


00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.920
maybe you guys can tell yourself,


00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.760
tell everyone a little bit about yourselves.


00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.400
You know, Barry, how'd you get into programming in Python?


00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.800
- Oh, well, I got into Python in 1994.


00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.760
I had just been hired at CNRI.


00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.760
And we were starting at this project called


00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.760
the Nobot Programming Environment or something like that.


00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.480
- Okay, what was that?


00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.320
- These were little software agents


00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.200
that were supposed to travel around the internet


00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.960
and get a little bit of information here,


00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.120
package themselves up, move over there,


00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.960
do some action over here,


00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.280
and move around to a bunch of different nodes.


00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.520
This was an important part of CNRI's


00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.680
digital library initiative at the time.


00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.960
And Roger Massey, who was my colleague at CNRI,


00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.640
we looked at, we were using Next Step and Objective-C


00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.000
and sort of doing that.


00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.960
And then, you know, I had worked at


00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.240
the National Institute of Standards and Technology


00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.440
earlier in my career, and I still had friends there.


00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.480
And one of the friends, of course, Paul knows,


00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.480
Ken Manheimer, who is the unsung hero for where Python is,


00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.280
because he crops up in so many places, you know?


00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.040
- Every Emacs RC file on the internet goes back to him.


00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.880
- Exactly.


00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.720
I haven't talked to Ken in a long time,


00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.160
but I hope he's doing well, 'cause I always,


00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.880
Ken's a great guy.


00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.880
So Ken was still at CNRI, and he forwarded to me an email


00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.160
saying, "Hey, this Dutch guy's coming over, you know,


00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.040
"to talk about this language that he created."


00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.240
- He's bringing a crazy language with no cynical.


00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.680
- Exactly, exactly.


00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.200
So we kind of pulled down Python at the time,


00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.000
played with it, and went, "Oh, this is pretty interesting."


00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So, you know, it was close to where we lived.


00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.120
So we just cruised up to Gaithersburg, Maryland,


00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.640
and spent three days at the first workshop,


00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.280
which, of course, Paul was at as well.


00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.200
He can talk about his experience.


00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.600
And we just, like, totally fell in love with Python,


00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.080
really, you know, resonated with Guido


00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.200
and what he was doing with the language.


00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.440
And, you know, long story short, ended up hiring Guido,


00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.800
bringing him over to the States.


00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.840
- Oh, fantastic.


00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.240
- You know, worked with him at CNRI for eight years.


00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.000
- An important part of the story, Barry,


00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.760
is CNRI meant something.


00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.520
- Yeah.


00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.880
- It's kind of, it viewed itself,


00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.200
I think it viewed itself as kind of the steward


00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.040
of the internet.


00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.720
- Well, of course, you know, CNRI was run by Bob Kahn


00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.240
and Vince Cerf at the time.


00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.920
And, you know, ran the IETF meetings,


00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.120
which, of course, are all the internet, you know,


00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.880
internet RFCs and things like that.


00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.720
So, and it was a not-for-profit research shop.


00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.880
So it really was kind of well-positioned


00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.160
to be Python's home for all those years,


00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.760
because, you know, there wasn't any sort of


00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.360
commercial aspect to it.


00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.240
It was all not-for-profit, and it was really,


00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.240
it was, you know, Python was a really good, you know,


00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.840
piece of technology, I think.


00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.760
And I think CNRI was a really good home for Python.


00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.960
- Yeah, it was a good breath of fresh air


00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.760
in terms of, you know, like compared to C at the time,


00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.240
where this fledgling Java thing


00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.240
that some company made up.


00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.360
- Yeah, yeah.


00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.040
So how did you, how was--


00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.320
- A comment I was gonna make on that is,


00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.200
Barry and I give this talk, Python 1994.


00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.200
We wear our shirts, we didn't wear our shirts tonight.


00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.720
- No, although.


00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.960
- And each time I kind of learn,


00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.760
I see, I learn a little bit more.


00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.080
- I love it.


00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.920
- Level of Python, yeah.


00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.760
(laughing)


00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.800
I got to say something like that.


00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.360
- I'm sure you have every shirt.


00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.560
- Yeah.


00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.960
- But there's kind of this, it's a narrow run thing,


00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.480
the sequence of dominoes.


00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.120
And the fact that you were at CNRI,


00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.200
and then CNRI was a place to go,


00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.680
if it would have been some other place, who knows?


00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.000
If you wouldn't have been at NIST


00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.920
before you landed at CNRI


00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.320
and the Michael McLean connection at NIST, who knows?


00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.400
- Yeah.


00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.120
- So that's an interesting point.


00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.400
- As much as you try to plan your life out


00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.840
and guide it in directions,


00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.480
these little happenstance experiences


00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.800
are sometimes the biggest pulls.


00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.800
- And you know, I had it come out to California


00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.040
a few months before I joined CNRI.


00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.880
And I interviewed with a company called Lucid.


00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.680
I don't know how many people remember Lucid, but-


00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.560
- Oh yeah.


00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.600
- They had this nice compiler suite


00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.280
and they were using Emacs.


00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.400
They had a fork of Emacs that they were using as their UI.


00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.240
And that was a version of Emacs that I was using at the time.


00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.800
So I came out here, interviewed,


00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.560
and ended up not moving out here,


00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.040
which was also another one of those fortuitous events


00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.320
in my life, certainly,


00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.000
because then just a couple of months later,


00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.720
I ended up at CNRI.


00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.440
And then a few months after that, met Guido


00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.480
and just took off from there.


00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.280
So you just never know.


00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.120
Yeah, you never know.


00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.800
- Yeah, and that's such an interesting time.


00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.040
Paul talked about being like the shepherd of the internet.


00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.880
1994, well, a year before,


00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.320
that's when the graphical web, HTTP,


00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.600
that whole story came around.


00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.600
I remember seeing Mosaic the first time


00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.120
and just seeing what the web was.


00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.360
And I was supposed to go to a physics class or something,


00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.680
like an evening physics lecture.


00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.960
And I'm just like, I'm skipping my class.


00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.560
I have half, I cannot believe that this is a real thing.


00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.280
I had been on Gopher and Archie


00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.760
and all of these things and telling them.


00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.840
I'm like, I'm seeing an entirely new world.


00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.560
I was so powerful to me to see that.


00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.720
So that's in the same time that all this is happening.


00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.200
- Yeah, it was a pretty magical time, I think.


00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.400
- Yeah, it was.


00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.640
It absolutely was.


00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.240
Let me just highlight a couple of things real quick


00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.760
before we move off your introduction.


00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.840
You were interviewed as part


00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.200
of this really interesting story,


00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.440
"Python is Eating the World,"


00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.040
how one developer's side project


00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.600
became the hottest programming language on the planet.


00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.800
So that was a really cool article.


00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.640
I remember that.


00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.480
And then-


00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.240
- Hey, Barry, you look good in that photo, man.


00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.080
- Yeah.


00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.240
(laughing)


00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.560
His colleague does.


00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.840
So, and then another thing that was really interesting


00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.840
was the Pep8 song that Leon Sandoy recently released,


00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.160
came out and I was like, oh, what a cool, clever idea.


00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.400
And then I realized today that you wrote


00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.320
and recorded "The Zen of Python" as a song.


00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.400
- Yeah.


00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.360
- Just nine months, at least you published it


00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.640
to SoundCloud nine months ago.


00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.400
That's a really cool song.


00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.000
I'll share the link with people


00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.840
so they can check that out for sure.


00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.640
- Yeah, and there is a, I did a, like a, you know,


00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.680
a quote, unquote, lyric video, you know, where I had,


00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.240
I basically did an iMovie.


00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.240
I took that soundtrack and I put,


00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.680
I put "The Zen of Python" lyric, you know,


00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.240
I call them lyrics, but,


00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.920
which I think we have to give a lot of credit-


00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.840
- Other people call it "Import This" or something like that?


00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.240
- Yeah, yeah, "Import This,"


00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.040
which of course comes from Tim Peters,


00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.520
who's, you know, even predates me in the Python land,


00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.000
you know, and Paul too, I guess.


00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.240
I think Tim was involved in Python


00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.320
almost from the beginning, you know?


00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.640
And, you know, he was of course our colleague,


00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.120
you know, as we were in Python labs and, you know,


00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.160
and so on and so forth, so.


00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.600
And Tim wrote "The Zen of Python," so.


00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.920
- Yeah, yeah, it's really neat.


00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.080
I think that's an interesting set of principles there.


00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.640
All right, Paul, how about you?


00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.960
- This is the, how do I get into Python question?


00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.080
- Yeah, maybe programming.


00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.240
I mean, you told the story a bit before, but yeah,


00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.600
like how do you get into this whole programming thing?


00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.680
- a cool program at school


00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.600
where we had a lab that had a bunch of stuff,


00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.480
the Commodore PETS, TRS-80,


00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.160
but the one that really stuck out to me


00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.160
was a DEC teletype connected to a mainframe


00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.880
at the university 200 miles away.


00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.720
And so--


00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.920
- You probably didn't even have to log in


00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.640
to connect to it, right?


00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.480
There probably wasn't even a--


00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.320
- Log in.


00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.160
- Yeah, probably didn't even have to connect.


00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.000
- Log in.


00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.840
- Exactly, just connect.


00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.680
- Exactly, yeah.


00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.800
- I got my own port, we're good.


00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.880
- Yeah, and so a modem, and what freaked me out was


00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.080
this modem is connected to the mini computer


00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.200
or mainframe or whatever,


00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.880
but if you called this phone number,


00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.240
this phone from this phone five feet away,


00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.760
it was a long distance call.


00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.280
(Paul and Jeff laughing)


00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.720
- And that used to matter.


00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.840
That's also a thing I kind of forgot, right?


00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.880
It was expensive.


00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.840
You're like, oh, there's this really sweet BBS


00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.480
that's got this information I want,


00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.520
but it's in another state,


00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.920
so we can only talk to it for so long.


00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.320
And you know, better hope you got 9600 baud


00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.440
and not 300 baud or whatever you're gonna get.


00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.560
Crazy.


00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.800
- Briefly, my Python origin story is,


00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.240
so Navy officer, working in Penn School


00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.200
for a great guy named Jim Glenn.


00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.000
'93, we did www.navy.mil,


00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.160
a source of infinite funny stories, some of them true.


00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.320
And there was a scripting, you know,


00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.760
it was pre CGI, but the same idea,


00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.080
you fork, standard out, standard in.


00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.800
And some of the people were writing


00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.560
their web server stuff, dynamic stuff in C,


00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.040
not gonna do that.


00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.080
Some were doing it in Bash, not gonna do that.


00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.240
So Pearl, I have this vivid memory, this story is true.


00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.280
Vivid memory of going to the bookstore,


00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.320
going to the computer shelf, it wasn't a section,


00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.600
get in the Pearl book.


00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.040
I can remember where I was staying,


00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.960
I'm like, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm."


00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.800
Oh, hell no.


00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.640
(laughing)


00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.400
Get back on the shelf.


00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.840
There was this downloadable tutorial


00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.280
for this thing called Python,


00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.360
and it was a scripting language.


00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.840
So it didn't reach for me.


00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.320
And damn, if that thing wasn't written for my brain,


00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.320
it was like perfectly the entrance for me into this.


00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.720
- Yeah, yeah.


00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.560
- That's awesome.


00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.320
Yeah, I think a lot of people, Python connects right away.


00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.480
- Yeah.


00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.680
- It depends on your history.


00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.720
If you've been writing C languages for a long time,


00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.560
you have to sort of break the paradigm, right?


00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.640
But you'll get there.


00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.320
- It's funny that Paul talks about Pearl,


00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.840
because, you know, I have the classic Pearl book,


00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.840
and I was into Pearl and Tickle,


00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.680
and I know you wanna ask about this.


00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.160
- The camel book?


00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.320
- The camel book.


00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.160
And it was totally dog-eared,


00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.560
and the spine was destroyed,


00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.280
because I could never keep Pearl in my head.


00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.760
And I think I have the first Python book,


00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.600
and it's like pristine,


00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.600
because Python just kind of fits in your head.


00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.440
- That's a good story.


00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.280
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.760
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.


00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.800
That's awesome.


00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.760
- Yeah.


00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.000
- All right, before we move off your introduction,


00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.040
Paul, I just wanna give a quick shout-out


00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.640
to two things that you and I did recently


00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.240
that was fun, people might also like.


00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.880
So you and I did, when I got my Apple Mac Mini M1


00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.320
back in December,


00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.080
you and I did a nice walkthrough,


00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.640
sort of exploration, like, well, can you,


00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.880
how does Python work over here?


00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.320
Can you run Jupyter Notebooks?


00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.280
What's the ripple like?


00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.760
And just, we compared a bunch of stuff,


00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.040
and that was a whole lot of fun.


00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.880
So I'll link to that, as well as,


00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.280
we also did a, over at JetBrains, where you work,


00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.160
we did a cool webcast,


00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.080
let's build a fast, modern Python API with FastAPI,


00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.840
and we just built that out.


00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.680
And, yeah, you got--


00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.520
- If I may say, Michael set the all-time JetBrains record


00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.520
for webinar attendance, it lasted one month,


00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.840
but you held it for a month.


00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.880
- Hey, that's awesome.


00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.600
I mean, so cool, thanks for having me over there.


00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.800
But now I wanna take you all on a journey.


00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.440
I wanna start you to take us on a journey.


00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.280
Check this out.


00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.200
You guys remember that?


00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.240
- Ooh. - Oh, yeah.


00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.720
- So what we have on the screen here, folks,


00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.360
is I couldn't get any earlier than 1997,


00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.440
but this is the 1997 Python.org.


00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.000
And it's got the original Python label,


00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.600
which is like one of those light board type things.


00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.920
And it talks about what Python is.


00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.560
So Python is this interpreted, interactive,


00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.840
object-oriented, extensible programming language,


00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.280
and it provides an extraordinary combination


00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.320
of clarity and versatility.


00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.760
It is free, it runs on Unix, PC, Macintosh, and others,


00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.480
and it's really interesting that it describes itself


00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.600
as free and non-proprietary, right?


00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.680
Like even, it almost predates


00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.240
this kind of Zen of open source side.


00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.840
It's just, you know, we'd have built this thing,


00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.680
he doesn't want it to be corporate,


00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.840
doesn't want it to be commercial,


00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.680
how can we build it as a community?


00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.840
So he was really blazing that trail, right?


00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.120
- It's pretty funny.


00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.160
I see the sixth International Python Conference there


00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.360
and Grail.


00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.200
That's a story. - Grail, that jumped out.


00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.440
- That's a story, yeah.


00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.640
- That is a story, that's an episode.


00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.480
- Oh yeah.


00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.720
A final version of Grail 0.3 is out.


00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.560
What's Grail?


00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.640
- Grail was a Python,


00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.640
completely Python-based web browser that ran,


00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.400
I think it was, we used Tcl/tk to render.


00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.960
That interesting story there,


00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.400
at least the way I remember it,


00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.120
so, you know, it could all be lies, who knows,


00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:18.040
was, you know, it kind of fit in with this notion


00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:23.040
of these software agents, because we had this idea,


00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.360
I think it was around the time of sort of Java


00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.280
in the browser, but I don't remember exactly the timing.


00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.720
- General Magic was the ones that were really pushing


00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.800
the mobile code thing.


00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.080
- Yeah.


00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.440
So the idea was we wanted to be able to run Python


00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.720
in the browser, right?


00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.080
And Bob had come, the way I remember it, at least,


00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.120
Bob had sort of had this idea about the same time


00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.520
and came to Guido and myself and the team and said,


00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.640
"Wouldn't this be a great thing if we had, you know,


00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.800
"Python running in the browser?"


00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.200
And Guido was pretty much like,


00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.240
"Yeah, you wanna see it?"


00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.520
You know, he had already done it, right?


00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.160
So, you know, right about the time Java


00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.600
in the browser was happening, you know,


00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.000
Python in the browser was working.


00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.840
So that's what Grail was.


00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.680
- How interesting.


00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.920
I think that even predates JavaScript.


00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.760
- Yeah, I think it does.


00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.880
- I think that's '97 or something like that.


00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.640
I can't remember exactly, but.


00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.320
- I can't tell you how much time I wasted


00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.920
trying to get tables working in Tcl TK


00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.440
inside of that Grail thing.


00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.640
(laughing)


00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.760
- A layout engine in Tcl TK.


00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.600
Oh my goodness.


00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.120
- It was brutal.


00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:30.960
- Yeah.


00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.680
A couple of thoughts on what you guys are saying.


00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.680
John Sheehan says, "Just fits in my brain.


00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.920
"It's probably the most quoted reason people like Python."


00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.760
- Yeah.


00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.600
- Yeah.


00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.080
And Jessica's pretty impressed at the age of this page.


00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.840
Yeah, that's like, think about how easy it used to be


00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.720
to do web design.


00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.840
You're like, "Okay, I can bold that section


00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.080
"and we'll put a horizontal line."


00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.160
Like, wow, you're a designer.


00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.880
That's incredible.


00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.680
It was so bad.


00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.120
It was so bad that it was like this opportunity.


00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.960
Really, really, really interesting.


00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.080
So, you know, let's jump back there.


00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.560
You know, like what other,


00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.040
we talked about some of these technologies,


00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.160
Perl and Tcl and so on.


00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.800
And the reason you guys chose 1994


00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.720
is this is when the first Python conference


00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.080
or workshop happened, right?


00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.160
You kind of partially mentioned that before, yeah?


00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:24.240
- Yeah, that's, I mean, that's certainly when I met Paul


00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.960
and Jim Fulton and a lot of, you know,


00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.000
Skip Montanaro at the time.


00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.960
Steven Majewski, right?


00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.440
- Yeah, Robin Friedrich.


00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.200
- Robin Friedrich.


00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.800
I think there was only 20 of us at that workshop.


00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.040
- Yeah, that's what I was gonna ask.


00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.160
You know, I go to PyCon


00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.880
and it's selling out the Cleveland Convention Center


00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.680
and who knows what it would have done in Pittsburgh


00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.520
if that ever happened.


00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.880
But, you know, it's a really big gathering.


00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.520
Like, I am, my voice is gone.


00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.600
My legs are tired from walking.


00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.440
And I, you know, maybe it takes me multiple days


00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.000
to get through the expo floor, right?


00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.200
Probably wasn't like that in the first one, right?


00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.160
It was-


00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.040
- No, it was just, you know, like I said-


00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.440
- I mean, I joke about it.


00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.400
When we heard we had room for 20 people, we're like, wow,


00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.000
what were we gonna do with all this room?


00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.600
You know, in this closed windowless office building


00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.640
in Gaithersburg, Maryland.


00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.800
- Yeah, yeah.


00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.800
We had people, I won't mention any names,


00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.720
but there was at least one person who I can think of


00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.960
who said, you know, you can't even mention that I'm here,


00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.520
that we use Python.


00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.760
- Oh, I know who that is.


00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.920
- Because it's a competitive advantage, right?


00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.600
- Yeah, interesting.


00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.200
- It was just like the fact that they were using Python


00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.360
was a secret, you know?


00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.040
So times have really changed quite a bit.


00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.880
- But it's kind of an important point


00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.200
that Barry and I try and talk about in the talk is,


00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.160
what was it like?


00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.000
Did you know, did we know then that it was a thing?


00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.320
Are there things from later in Python


00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.600
that you can trace back to that origin story?


00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.240
It's kind of an interesting thought exercise.


00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.840
You don't wanna romanticize the past,


00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.640
but at the same time, you know, I think Barry,


00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.640
you and I have kind of a similar impression


00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.680
about kind of how things went down there.


00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:24.400
- Yeah, I mean, again, it's all these little lucky changes,


00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.800
you know, twists and turns in life and technology


00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.400
and things like that.


00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.960
But I think it's really clear.


00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.960
And I did a talk in 2018 for Bay Piggies,


00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.320
which is the Bay, you know, the Bay area.


00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.080
And I went back and I tried to, you know,


00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.880
download as many versions of Python.


00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.520
I couldn't build a single one of them on any like modern OS


00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.920
without changes.


00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.880
But I went through like all the change logs


00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.480
and the what's new and things like that.


00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:58.280
And you can really trace the history of the language


00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.120
all the way through.


00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.000
You can see the thread, you know, from even before I,


00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.920
you know, I think it was like version 0.91


00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.560
is the first one you can pull down.


00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.560
And you can really see how Guido's vision


00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.520
for the language that he wanted to put out there


00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.840
is still alive today.


00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.840
It's still really, even through Python 3,


00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.160
through the type hinting,


00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.960
any new feature you wanna talk about,


00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.960
the flavor, the sense of Python is still, you know.


00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.240
- It feels really continuous, you know.


00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:40.400
One of the similar thought paths I like to go down


00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.280
or analogies I like to draw is,


00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.080
well, JavaScript came along and did some stuff.


00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.920
And then they said, well, let's add things like type hints


00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.840
and async and let's make this TypeScript language.


00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.280
In my experience going down that path was,


00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.440
oh, JavaScript's kind of easy.


00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.280
Why is it so complicated now?


00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.800
There's all these like dependencies in other libraries


00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.440
and libraries of libraries and left padding things.


00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.280
And then, you know, it got to TypeScript


00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.680
and I'm like, this is a really frustrating addition


00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.080
'cause 80% of the time it's like,


00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.560
wow, what a cool addition.


00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.040
Oh, wait, this thing I need to use


00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.280
doesn't have some right type definition.


00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.280
So I can't, how come it won't let me use this thing?


00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.200
And somehow Python has managed to grow through the years


00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.520
with those types of additions without going like,


00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.840
oh, why is it, why does it hate me now?


00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.200
Like, why do I have to fight it so much?


00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.240
You know, it just, you can kind of,


00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.480
actually, I think more broadly,


00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.580
this is like a really powerful aspect of Python


00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.460
is that you can use and understand and take


00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.880
as little or as much of it as makes sense for you.


00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.280
Like you can be super effective


00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.560
with a very partial understanding of Python, right?


00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.760
I know how to import modules, call some cool functions.


00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.520
I didn't have to write a method.


00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.200
I just put these 10 lines in here


00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.280
and look what amazing thing I did


00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.000
where so many languages don't do that.


00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.960
And I think that that's a really powerful aspect


00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.400
that it has these cool features,


00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.680
but they're not like in your face, like a lot of languages.


00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.400
- Yeah, Paul may have additional thoughts,


00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.360
but I think that's, I think you're onto something there


00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.560
because I've always considered Python


00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.520
the type of language that really scales


00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.360
with whatever you're trying to do, right?


00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.400
If I'm just gonna throw a, you know, I just need a script.


00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.120
I have this, and this is kind of a funny thing.


00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.680
I was upgrading one of my machine, my Macs to Big Sur,


00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.720
and I lost all of my notes for,


00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.560
like I use the Notes app religiously.


00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.120
- Right, and it should go through iCloud,


00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.080
but because it's Apple, sometimes it doesn't.


00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.520
- Yeah, sometimes it just doesn't work.


00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.880
So I actually like did a little bit of searching,


00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.320
found the SQLite database and played around with the scheme.


00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.360
I try to figure things out.


00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.680
And then I wrote a little Python script, you know,


00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.680
25, 30 lines to just like suck it out


00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.320
of the SQLite database.


00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.280
And, you know, I restored all my notes.


00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.760
So even at that level, you know, Python's awesome,


00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.200
but then, you know, you can build huge applications


00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.600
in Python, especially with type, you know,


00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.040
the typing, type hinting, it just scales.


00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.760
Python just scales with whatever you want to do, you know?


00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.240
- Yeah, yeah.


00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.480
And there's a lot of languages that go to that far end,


00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.960
but you've got to start somewhere in the middle, right?


00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.680
You've got to understand, you know, nullable optional types.


00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.040
And no, you can't set that to nil because, you know,


00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.600
just like all that kind of stuff, right?


00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.960
Eventually you might want that,


00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.480
but you shouldn't have to have it all the time.


00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.320
- Yeah.


00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.160
- Yeah, I think that's magic.


00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.680
- One that is, I guess one of the last talks I gave


00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.160
was at PyCon, Colorado, which was a wonderful conference.


00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.840
And I was actually giving Python 1994 there as a keynote.


00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.360
And right when I got to the part about spam two,


00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.440
when we first heard of Java, no kidding, thunder.


00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.040
(imitates thunder)


00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.320
It was like the most awesomely theatrical thing.


00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.280
Perfect timing.


00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.240
- You are a dramatic speaker, that was good.


00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.440
- Yeah.


00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.360
Yeah, so I've got this look on my face like,


00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.000
okay, you won't believe this.


00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.760
But what they told me was at the meetups,


00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.360
like 70% of the people coming to the Python meetups


00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.120
just came to Python less than a year ago.


00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:24.960
- Yeah.


00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.360
- And if you look at the Python developer survey,


00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.720
which you were talking about in the most recent Python Bytes.


00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.920
- Yeah, I was going to say, there's some company,


00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.560
it's called JetBrains, they did this survey.


00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.200
And it's like 150% of the Python community


00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.160
arrived yesterday, you know?


00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.000
- Yeah, yeah.


00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.840
- And let's face it, where are they coming


00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.040
from data science?


00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.200
And let's face that, why are they coming to Python?


00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.120
Because Michael, what you just said,


00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.440
jump right in, start coding,


00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.320
you don't have to eat your vegetables.


00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.160
- Yeah, exactly.


00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.160
I'm trying to find this for us here and find the exact.


00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:02.360
- But actually I will try to tie it back


00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.160
to our alleged agenda.


00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.440
- We have an agenda.


00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.200
- Who were we fighting in 1994, scripting languages?


00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.840
It was Perl and Tcl and then, and then, and then Python.


00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.280
And we were all lumped into this toy language scripting


00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.480
and the grownups would come back later


00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.800
and reprogram it all in a serious language


00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.120
and stuff like that.


00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.680
And wow, how did that turn out?


00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.960
- Yeah. - Yeah.


00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.080
- Yeah.


00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.200
- Yeah, I think there's a lot of special stuff


00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.400
about this entry level that is,


00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.080
to me it feels almost like a stealth way


00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.200
to capture people's excitement and energy around programming.


00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.960
It's like, ah, I'm not a programmer,


00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.560
but I've heard that there's some cool libraries


00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.560
for working with whatever I do, biology, chemistry,


00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.640
whatever, economics.


00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.000
And if I just import this and do these three lines,


00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.080
like I'll do something really amazing.


00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.200
And probably that person's colleagues are like,


00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.880
wow, you're a wizard.


00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.720
How did you do this?


00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.040
Like, well, it was like these four lines, right?


00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.000
And they just slowly make it a little better,


00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.600
a little better, and they never think of themselves


00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.440
as programmers.


00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.600
And then like two years later,


00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.320
they're building machine learning,


00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.360
put in production, with behind Flask or FastAPI.


00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.400
And they're like, how did I get here?


00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.720
Like, I just never even knew I was gonna be here, right?


00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.000
And I think that's the magic is you just,


00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.120
you don't get ejected.


00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.640
It's not like, well, I made it sort of this far.


00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.120
Now it's time for a grownup language.


00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.360
Go learn C++ and be real now, right?


00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.440
Like that doesn't often happen.


00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.000
Here's the part, here's the part you were talking about, Paul.


00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.320
That, again, the fact that like Python scales


00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.320
from throwaway scripts to huge applications,


00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.080
it also really scales to the experience


00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.840
of the person using it.


00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.000
So it appeals to non-programmers


00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.480
who are just trying to get their other stuff done, right?


00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.960
And they need to do some programming,


00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.320
but it also somehow also appeals to professional programmers


00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.280
who are building like production-level quality software.


00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.080
And it just resonates with both those audiences.


00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.000
- Yeah, I love that.


00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.400
- What was Tim Peters doing before Python?


00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.960
Oh yeah, writing compilers for Cray computers.


00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.200
(laughing)


00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.800
You got a problem harder than that?


00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.640
No, I don't.


00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.200
(laughing)


00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.960
- Well, yeah, you know,


00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.360
one of the things I think is interesting


00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.840
is I was just reminiscing about talking to Mamoud Hichemi


00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.440
four or five years ago about Python and the enterprise


00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.240
and how it was kind of a really interesting story


00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.680
that big companies that were not just tech giants,


00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.240
but boring, quote, boring insurance companies and stuff.


00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.480
And I use that in a positive sense right now.


00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.320
They were also using Python in really interesting ways.


00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.440
Like Bank of America has a Python project


00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.920
with 5 million, sorry, 5,000 Python developers


00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.840
and millions of lines of code.


00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.920
And that kind of stuff is,


00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.720
I think at least when I would talk to people,


00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.400
it felt like that was noteworthy


00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.480
to have those conversations five years ago.


00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.200
And now it's just like, well, yeah, we are.


00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.040
Who would not?


00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.040
Like, it'd be insane not to do this.


00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.200
Most companies at least have like a data science wing


00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.120
or something that's all about Python.


00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.200
You know, project that from 1994 forward.


00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.360
Like, how does that, like, how did that feel


00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.400
to see it that way now?


00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.360
And what was the perspective back then?


00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:21.160
- Again, this is, I think the magic secret sauce of Python.


00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.480
Right back then it was CGI and, you know,


00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.840
web programming and things like that.


00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.720
And Python was perfectly suited for that.


00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.200
And now we're, you know, fast forward 30 years or about,


00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.480
and, you know, the domains that are sort of the hot things


00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.600
that everybody needs to be able to do,


00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.200
Python just is malleable.


00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.720
It's just, it just adapts to that environment.


00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.560
I mean-


00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.040
- A lot of surprising things are Python first now.


00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.520
Like a lot of the ML stuff,


00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.200
which sounds computationally insanely heavy,


00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.600
is still, you know, Python first


00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.560
because that's the way people want to talk to it.


00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.880
Who cares how its guts get over to the GPUs or whatever.


00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.280
- Exactly, exactly.


00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.120
- Yeah.


00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.800
Yeah, I even saw that that little helicopter rover thing


00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.800
flying around Mars had a little bit of Python involved in it.


00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.960
As far as I can tell though,


00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.240
the system that they're using,


00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.640
I went to the GitHub repository and poked around.


00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.160
People are like, you know, Python's on Mars,


00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.000
Python's on Mars.


00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.040
I'm like, all right, well, let's see some details.


00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:18.880
As far as I can tell,


00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.320
Python was used to train the models on there.


00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.680
But I don't know that it's executed.


00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.160
There's a bunch of C++ code


00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.440
and I suspect that's what's actually executing the stuff


00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.280
that was trained up. - Probably.


00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.440
- But still pretty interesting


00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.880
that it was part of the story.


00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.920
- Yeah, yeah.


00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.480
- Yeah, so, you know, the things that we talk about now,


00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.560
Bill, Async and Await, TypeHence,


00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.280
web stuff, machine learning.


00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.960
Like those, a lot of those things,


00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.600
maybe the Gil was worth,


00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.680
was really on the radar then.


00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.880
But a lot of the stuff like TypeHence and ML and whatnot


00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.120
are fairly new, I suspect.


00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.040
What kind of things did you all talk about


00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.600
back in '94 and '95 and so on?


00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.640
Like what was the important stuff


00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.160
that you had to work out then?


00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.080
- The things I remember from the first workshop


00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:10.080
were the Don Beaudry meta class hook.


00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.040
Did I steal your thunder?


00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:14.880
Sorry, Paul.


00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.200
Go ahead, you can take it.


00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.040
- No, hit it.


00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.160
Just don't make a mess of it.


00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.040
- Well, the funny thing was, you know,


00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.720
I had just started getting into Python.


00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.160
So like a lot of that kind of went over my head.


00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.400
I didn't really quite understand


00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.000
'cause I hadn't looked at the details


00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.400
of like the implementation of the object model


00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.040
and things like that at the time.


00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.400
So I didn't really understand completely.


00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.040
I sort of understood metaprogramming a little bit,


00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.920
but I didn't quite get what Don


00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.720
and Guido were talking about at the time.


00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.480
And I think Jim was involved, Jim Fulton as well,


00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.240
'cause he had, I guess you guys were sort of thinking


00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.120
about ZOPE or whatever the precursor to ZOPE was,


00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.720
and he was thinking about metaprogramming for that.


00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.640
- Yeah, and it's weird.


00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.160
I think it was 'cause of Fortran for whatever reason,


00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.240
interfacing Fortran in Python.


00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.120
I might have that wrong, but Don Beaudry,


00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.360
okay, so I'll unwind it a little bit.


00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.400
At that workshop, Michael,


00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.200
some of the things you were just saying,


00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.280
you can't, like Barry hinted at before,


00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.160
you can trace back to that workshop.


00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.000
- Yeah, yeah.


00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.840
- And some of the problems that needed to be solved there.


00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.120
The things I worked on were none of those,


00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.520
but I observed the useful stuff.


00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:36.480
And C extensions is everything that Barry


00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.080
was just talking about.


00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.440
It happens to be the tip of the iceberg


00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.040
on why Python has this sudden resurgence


00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.880
because NumPy is all under the water in C.


00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.200
But back then, it was a mess,


00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.680
and I'm using that as a joke


00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.640
because Don Beaudry's extension ideas


00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.960
and software were called mess.


00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.320
And Jim came back later with extension class


00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.840
that kind of formalized it.


00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.520
This kind of gives genesis to when you briefly,


00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.440
in Python 2, used to import from object,


00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.800
or I'm sorry, subclass from object


00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.000
to kind of get new style objects and stuff like that.


00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.760
That's a little remnant from,


00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.280
I think a little bit from those days.


00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.080
- That was more like a Python 2 thing


00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.760
where the new, like we had classic classes,


00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.600
which were the old style class hierarchy,


00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.920
and then the new style classes,


00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.000
they lived together for a long,


00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.120
until Python 3, obviously.


00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.160
And you had to either,


00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.640
you had to basically like inherit from object


00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.840
or set your meta class,


00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.480
dunder meta class attribute to do it.


00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.720
- But the point is, back in those days,


00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.320
interfacing the big pile of C code was such a big deal


00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.040
'cause we were the kid little toy scripting language.


00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.880
- Right, yeah.


00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:59.400
- You know, and it's just so interesting to me


00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.880
that we went through a phase of outgrowing that,


00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.600
and you had these enormous systems


00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.600
that are mostly the waters being carried in Python.


00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.120
Now back to the chief value proposition


00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.520
is run that crap on the GPU


00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.760
and let the programmers hang out in Python.


00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.280
- Right, or some distributed grid computing,


00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.560
or I don't wanna know where,


00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.640
just run it in a low level thing.


00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:26.320
And I wanna talk to it in this simple, clean API.


00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.680
Yeah.


00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.760
- Yeah, the irony of course, I think,


00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.200
is that in a lot of ways,


00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.520
the C API is holding us back now.


00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.360
- Sure.


00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.200
- To be honest with you,


00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.960
you know, there are-- - Yeah, sure.


00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.880
- The way I-- - You wanna change


00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.680
the memory management model to be more GC or do a JIT?


00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.880
It's all easy except for those little pointers


00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.320
you passed off, who knows what happens now, right?


00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.080
- Exactly, and the macros that are used to access tuples


00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.120
and so on and so forth,


00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:59.720
references, those are all issues that are holding back,


00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.800
I think, I mean, sort of the way I think about it is,


00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.120
there's nothing wrong with Python the language


00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.840
today that would prevent it from being the language


00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.800
of choice 30 years from now.


00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.160
But we're also dealing with,


00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:20.200
the CPython interpreter is a 30 year old VM.


00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.640
And we've learned a thing or two about like how to write


00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.200
high performance VMs in that time.


00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.440
And getting the CPython implementation modernized


00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.360
to the point where we can do things like


00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.080
potentially remove the GIL or adopt a GC


00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.600
or all those kinds of things that we wanna do.


00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.000
We have to now deal with 30 years of backwards compatibility


00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.760
and that's a difficult problem to,


00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.040
both a technical and a social problem to overcome.


00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.920
- Well-- - And we're older than Java.


00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.480
- Yeah, well, the other thing I think, Barry,


00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.040
that is makes that really significant is,


00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.480
there's the technical problem.


00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.920
I think honestly, you could say,


00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.600
we're gonna just change the way it works.


00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.000
And the important stuff's gonna get upgraded


00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.840
and the stuff that hasn't been touched for five years,


00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.240
it's just gonna have to run on the old thing


00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.280
and we could just move forward, right?


00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.680
That would be fine.


00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.600
But I look at the difference between Python 2 and Python 3


00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.840
and they seem really small to me, right?


00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.040
A little bit with strings and bytes,


00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.560
a little bit on classes, a few things.


00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.240
And that was, that was existentially bad,


00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:30.320
that disjoint eight year period where the core developers


00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.040
were working on one thing and so many other people are like,


00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.120
well, we're not gonna touch that thing.


00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.400
We're just gonna work on, right?


00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.000
That was not a good deal.


00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.160
And the types of changes that you all are talking about,


00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.480
while maybe awesome,


00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.720
they seem more significant than that, at least.


00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.000
And I suspect that people, at least for a while,


00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.960
are not willing to stomach another round of that.


00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.920
What do you think?


00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:56.320
- I actually, I think if there ever is a Python 4


00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.120
and I kind of doubt there will be a Python 4,


00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.200
I think it's not gonna be at the Python level.


00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.840
To the extent that it's possible to like, for example,


00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.320
remove the gill and not require Python level changes,


00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.360
which is still questionable,


00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.840
but it's all gonna be at the C API,


00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.480
at the FFI sort of level, right?


00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.120
It's gonna be the things that Python integrates with


00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.800
that are gonna change significantly.


00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.800
And I think that's, if I had my magic hat on


00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.840
with a million dollars and I don't know,


00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.480
a few tens of people to work on it, that's what I would do.


00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.600
- Yeah, you could change the way it runs


00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.080
without changing the language whatsoever, right?


00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.400
That would be totally fine.


00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.760
- Yeah, yeah.


00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.680
And I don't think there's any magic.


00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.120
Like if, you know, when I talk to people


00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.120
who have worked on JavaScript VMs or other VMs,


00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.200
like we know what to do.


00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.560
It's no, there's no magical thing


00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.840
that we have to go figure out.


00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.000
This has all been done over and over again.


00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:57.960
Not that I could do it,


00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.960
but you know, experts in building VMs could certainly do it.


00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.200
But it's managing that, I think the social side,


00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.320
like what do you do about NumPy


00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.360
and all the C extensions that are out there?


00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:14.360
That's a big ask.


00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.880
- Eric Snow's effort with sub-interpreters


00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.880
is kind of generated a lot of what about us from NumPy.


00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.880
- Yeah. - Oh, really?


00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.720
Okay.


00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.560
- Yeah, that's one of the attempts to not remove the gill,


00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.800
not a colectomy, but a, let's just have many gills


00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.720
and they can all coexist.


00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.160
- Right, right, right, right.


00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.920
- Yeah, so just sort of on this historical,


00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.080
like broad picture kind of journey we're on.


00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.480
You know, you mentioned like very,


00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.600
you mentioned JavaScript JITs and VMs.


00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.800
Does it surprise you guys what has happened


00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.880
with JavaScript and its performance and stuff?


00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.240
This thing that just ran in web browsers


00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:00.240
and now it's, they've gotten it to perform reasonably well.


00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.640
To me, I just never saw that little thing


00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.440
going where it's ended up either.


00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.120
- Yeah, I don't know.


00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.720
It doesn't really surprise me too much


00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.240
because I think, and Paul probably understands this,


00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.800
you know, like languages are a lot like editors, right?


00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.560
Like there's a religious part, maybe not religious,


00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.120
but there's a, there's an emotional--


00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.320
- Identity part. - Tribalism.


00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.600
- Yeah, tribalism, that's a great,


00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.640
or emotional connection to it.


00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.400
You know, people love Python and they wanna use it


00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.720
and you know, that gets them into that world.


00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.560
There's a lot of people whose first real experience


00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.600
with programming is sort of web technologies,


00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.920
JavaScript, CSS, HTML, things like that.


00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.800
- Especially in the bootcamp side of things these days.


00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.480
They've all seemed to have really, really glommed on


00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.880
to that, almost I think to detriment for folks,


00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.240
but you know, I think they've generated too many


00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.600
just front end developers and not like broad skilled folks,


00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.640
but anyway, that's a side story.


00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.400
- Yeah, so you know, people, that's, you know,


00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.760
young people come in and they learn JavaScript


00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.160
and they enjoy it and they can, you know, get,


00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.160
see the results immediately in their browser


00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.320
and do really cool things.


00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.760
And so I think it's a natural progression


00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.600
to wanna be able to take that environment


00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.480
or that experience and move it into other domains.


00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:25.600
And some, you know, JavaScript seems to be, you know,


00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.880
pretty malleable about that, you know.


00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.400
- So what about having, one of the value propositions


00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.480
in the JavaScript world is it's JavaScript


00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:38.480
all the way down, you know, could it be Python


00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.320
all the way down, right?


00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.680
Like in the reverse direction, sort of.


00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.640
What do you guys think of the opportunity of web assembly


00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.640
and that sort of like expand the places


00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.000
that Python is happy?


00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.880
- Yeah, Paul, you wanna?


00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.720
- Sure, and I know you did a podcast with Brett


00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.680
about this at the last PyCon.


00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.240
- And we did a live one, yeah, exactly.


00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.400
We talked about the opportunity of Rust


00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.680
and web assembly for that, yeah.


00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.520
I mean, they kind of go together.


00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.320
- So in theory, that should be like Python's big chance


00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.040
to kind of, 'cause Python, and this is the,


00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.240
my little passion project working on the weekends


00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.960
about Python and the modern web and Python's web story


00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.960
and there's a lot of hope misplaced in my opinion


00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.920
on Wasm as a silver bullet for Python.


00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.200
Heavy lift to kind of get there


00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.800
and the destination probably won't be what you think.


00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:39.840
But at the same time, it has opportunities


00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.880
that I don't think we quite understand and appreciate


00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.720
from a platform that we could benefit


00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.560
even on the server side, even on the mobile side


00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:51.600
to be not just producers of Wasm, but consumers of Wasm.


00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:56.240
- Yeah, there's a really cool Python library


00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.160
that will let you interop with any Wasm language.


00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.000
- Yes.


00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.680
- I forgot what it's called, but it's not in the browser.


00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.040
It's just locally.


00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:04.880
- Sure, right.


00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.040
- You get some Wasm library that could be written in C,


00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.440
it could be written in Java,


00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.880
whatever compiles down to that in Rust


00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.000
and then I'm gonna use that in Python.


00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.120
- I'm glad you're bringing it up


00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:19.480
and it's nice to tie it in a way that 1994


00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.440
because I do care a lot about Python and the web


00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.760
and I worry and I give talks about Python


00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.040
and the modern web.


00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.400
But it's interesting, a name we didn't mention


00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.120
kind of along your lines of JavaScript


00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.640
kind of eating the world


00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.520
and maybe Michael Kennedy's talk JavaScript to me


00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.520
coming to a theater near you sometimes.


00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.760
(laughing)


00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.640
And the one that came out of nowhere


00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.640
and ate the world in the first third of Python was PHP.


00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.360
- Oh yeah.


00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.480
Yeah.


00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.800
- And it should have run off, it should have hit its ceiling


00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.800
and maybe a little bit like x86,


00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.840
maybe a little bit like JavaScript,


00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.520
maybe like a whole bunch of other things


00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.200
that should have jumped the shark.


00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.320
There were plenty of sharks left to jump.


00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.480
And PHP got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger


00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.520
and was being used for things


00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.000
that never should have been used for


00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.280
because the law of large numbers.


00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:27.560
And we just gotta be worried about the law of large numbers


00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.760
with JavaScript as well.


00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.840
- Yeah, for sure.


00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.320
John Sheehan says, transcript.


00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.960
- Transcript, yes.


00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.240
I have for my little secret project


00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.560
actually originated with generating some transcript


00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.160
from Python side components.


00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.640
- Interesting, yeah.


00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.040
You know, a world that I would love to see is,


00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.080
like the reason that JavaScript is so popular


00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.680
is it's a non-avoidable requirement


00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.920
'cause it's the thing that all the browsers ship with


00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.600
that have a runtime.


00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.160
With WebAssembly, it's totally simple to compile


00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.080
CPython over there.


00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.080
There's things that don't work


00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.360
and there's maybe some edges you gotta fix.


00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.000
Probably also for the JVM,


00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.560
probably also for the .NET runtime.


00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.080
All these runtimes, they could be put into this form


00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.680
if the browsers would ship language runtimes.


00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.520
If they would just go,


00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:23.600
our browser includes CPython, includes .NET, includes Java.


00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.920
Oh, it also includes JavaScript.


00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.600
That would just change the game.


00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.760
But because every alternative is like,


00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:30.400
well, you need a 20 meg download.


00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.240
Well, that's a different,


00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.360
oh, well, that's not gonna work, right?


00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.120
The browser people could decide.


00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.680
There's only two of them left in the world.


00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.000
Maybe three if you count Safari.


00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.800
But really, it's Chrome and then Firefox


00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.320
and a little Safari.


00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.760
It wouldn't be that hard to say,


00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.320
let's try to make some of these other languages available


00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.200
as runtimes through WebAssembly.


00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.480
We already do WebAssembly.


00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.880
Just ship the binary and we'll be good to go.


00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.960
I would love to see that,


00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.960
but I'm not seeing any movement there.


00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:02.360
- Yeah, Barry has a story about JavaScript and Python.


00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.200
- You know, it's funny you mentioned that


00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.000
'cause I was gonna say that.


00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.720
But I have since learned that it's not actually true.


00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.800
So I'm gonna skip that one.


00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.920
- I was watching Brendan Ike's podcast


00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.400
and I was waiting for him to say it and he didn't.


00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.040
- I have a colleague here at LinkedIn


00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.160
who kind of hooked me,


00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.600
not directly up with Brendan,


00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:30.320
but I was like, am I misremembering this story?


00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.800
And yeah, it's kind of true.


00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.520
I was misremembering the story.


00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.840
- I like your story though.


00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.760
- It's a great story, it just wasn't true.


00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.600
(laughing)


00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.160
- Yeah, yeah.


00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.640
RJL out there says that'd be a great idea, Michael.


00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.240
What's stopping Google and Firefox from doing that?


00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.920
I don't know. - Market forces.


00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.800
- Well, I mean, to be fair,


00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.920
Microsoft has created this thing called Blazor


00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.360
that put the .NET runtime in there.


00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.600
You just gotta download it, right?


00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.960
So I would not actually be surprised


00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.640
to see that ship with Edge at some point.


00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.640
But that idea across,


00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.760
at least let, I think JavaScript's fine,


00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.280
but let's let it compete on fair playing ground, right?


00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.640
Like where the other languages


00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.280
could possibly even be an option.


00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.560
So that would be fantastic for everyone, I think.


00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.400
And with WebAssembly, there's some interop, so who knows?


00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:22.560
So, you know, looking forward,


00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.320
like are you guys just astonished


00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.680
that that group of 20 people, 1994, worked on this project?


00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.160
And then, you know, you get articles like that,


00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.720
that tech one that I had about, you know,


00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.480
Python is eating the world of software sort of thing.


00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.800
Like, these are really big gaps.


00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:46.040
Did you guys ever imagine that you were onto, you know,


00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.280
a flame that would burn so bright?


00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.560
- Oh, you wanna?


00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:57.000
- This is, you and I talk about this


00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.160
kind of in the closing a little bit.


00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.640
And it's related to the why,


00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.720
how did Python get to where it got to?


00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.920
What were the ingredients?


00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.560
Could you trace it back to then?


00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.520
And when we gave the talk the first time


00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.240
at the keynote panel at PyCon,


00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.360
Jim Fulton actually brought this up,


00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.800
that people talk about the Python community


00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.840
being so kind and human,


00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.120
and it's because Guido's kind and human.


00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.600
And so kind of put into the DNA back to 1994


00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:37.160
was a person and a group of people around


00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.840
who valued those kinds of things


00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.440
at a time when other language communities


00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.680
had a bad reputation for those kinds of things.


00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.800
Barry, you wanna expand on that?


00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.120
- I think it was Brett Cannon who coined the term,


00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.760
"I came for the language and stayed for the community."


00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.480
And that is so true.


00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.480
I mean, my closest friends,


00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:05.280
and in many ways, I mean, Guido actually lives


00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.560
not far from me now.


00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.560
And I love just kind of getting together with him.


00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.400
And a lot of times we don't even talk about Python.


00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.640
- Yeah, that's right.


00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:18.040
- I have some of my really valued friends


00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.160
I've met through Python.


00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:24.160
So I think it does come down to Guido's leadership


00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.480
as far as personality and the kind of community


00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.840
that he helped foster.


00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:34.400
It feels very inclusive and very positive


00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.720
and empowering to people.


00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:40.760
And I just really think that the community


00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.920
has done as much as the language


00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.480
to sort of build Python to where it is today.


00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.640
- Mike, I'll try and get back to your question a little bit


00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.720
with a little bit of an anecdote.


00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.560
- All right.


00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:57.200
- The role in the play was never technical,


00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:02.000
but I made coffee for the smart people.


00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.840
And I would do some of the organization stuff


00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.880
like the PSA and PSF with Greg Stein.


00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.680
And then I went away for a while and lived in Europe,


00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.560
didn't go to PyCons, came back,


00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.280
and damn, if Capital One didn't have a booth at PyCon.


00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.200
- Yeah.


00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.440
- That blew me away.


00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.480
Back when we had Spam One, Spam Two, Spam Three,


00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:28.880
this NIST workshop, to think that would be an outcome.


00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.960
And that these like really serious major players


00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.840
felt like, wow, we gotta go do this.


00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.000
It's just astonishing to me.


00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.520
- Yeah, for me as well.


00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.920
And I'm thinking back to the job fair


00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.160
that was in the 2020 PyCon,


00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.080
you know, walking around there,


00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.680
you just, so many people are like,


00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.160
we're hiring or building these Python teams


00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.360
to build our software.


00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.800
And some were, you know, the usual suspects,


00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.000
but many of them were not.


00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:00.960
Many of them were like you said,


00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.800
like Capital One type of places.


00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.280
You're like, you guys are doing this?


00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.240
- Deloitte, I mean, really, wow.


00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.600
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, super, super interesting.


00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:13.600
And I feel like the sentiment has shifted a little bit.


00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.040
It used to be like, oh, these corporate entities


00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.560
are gonna come in and like muck up our culture


00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.200
and like break, they're gonna corrupt some of the,


00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.320
they're gonna be somewhat corrupting influences.


00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.440
And I feel like, I don't really see


00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.600
that that's happened so much.


00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.760
So I'm happy for that.


00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.200
I feel like if anything, it's been a supporting type


00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.440
of thing to have this much opportunity in this ecosystem.


00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.440
- Absolutely.


00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.360
- And something I'll add to that is,


00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:44.720
as much as we cherish Python the language,


00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:48.240
a perhaps not equal achievement,


00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.560
but an important achievement is the PSF.


00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:55.520
And it's underappreciated because Barry and I


00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.160
were responsible for the failed predecessor,


00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.720
Python's overactivity.


00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.800
These things require a number of ingredients


00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.200
and they require heroes.


00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.240
And in the middle third of Python,


00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.520
the PSF and PyCon emerged


00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:14.160
and these are important achievements.


00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.320
- Yeah, many people are probably aware of it.


00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.880
I suspect many are not who are listening.


00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.680
How important PyCon is for funding the PSF in general.


00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:29.680
That's the vast majority of their income is through that.


00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.360
And honestly, it was a big scare


00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.280
on what's gonna happen when COVID hit.


00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:38.200
They waited to the very last minute to cancel PyCon


00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.160
when the writing was clearly on the wall


00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.120
that people cannot go there.


00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.840
But it's like, well, we gotta just figure out


00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:45.840
all the finances.


00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:47.200
It was a big deal, right?


00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.760
- Yeah, huge.


00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.320
And let me echo Paul,


00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.920
because the PSF and the folks,


00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:58.680
Eva and E and all the people who are involved in the PSF,


00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.240
I can't even go through all the names.


00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:06.240
They do such great work and important work


00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.000
for the Python ecosystem and the Python community.


00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.800
And kudos to every single one of them


00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.360
'cause they're just fantastic people


00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.480
and it's a great organization.


00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:20.480
And the PSF is not only supports what Python is today,


00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.600
but it really looks ahead.


00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.080
So like on the steering council,


00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.440
we work very closely with the PSF to try to understand


00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:34.440
how can we utilize the PSF to help fund important work,


00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:39.240
for example, that Python, the language


00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.320
or CPython, the implementation really needs.


00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:44.760
So that's a great partnership.


00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.480
I think that's kind of built up over the years.


00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.800
- Yeah, and there was just a big announcement


00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:54.800
that Google became the first visionary sponsor of the PSF,


00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.960
which is like $390,000 a year or something like that


00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.360
in hiring a core developer in residence.


00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:05.760
So yeah, that's a huge sign of big support coming along.


00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.600
- Yeah.


00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.760
- Maybe to close out this topic,


00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:12.760
if anybody out there has concerns about the PSF


00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:17.360
or like really deep seated problems with it,


00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.720
and you see me and Barry sometime,


00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.960
get us to tell you about the Python software.


00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:22.800
- Yeah.


00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.240
- You'll feel a lot better about the PSF.


00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.080
- Yeah.


00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.680
- Yeah, that's good.


00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.080
So on our little screen share here,


00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:32.760
I put up the new Python, the latest Python.org


00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.080
compared to the 1997 one.


00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.400
And it just occurred to me one thing


00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.760
that I went years without knowing


00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.640
is there's this little prompt icon


00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.720
right on the home page.


00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:46.760
If you click that, oh, it's not working anymore.


00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.680
Oh my goodness.


00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.680
- Live demos, man.


00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.920
- Yeah, I guess it doesn't work right now.


00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.840
Maybe the Python Anywhere folks should have a look at this.


00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.240
Probably it'll work by then.


00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.800
- I'll get on the Slack channel.


00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.120
- Yeah, yeah, let them know.


00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.720
But I was really surprised you can go there and click


00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:01.440
and it just opened up the Python or Apple,


00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.440
I think running in Python Anywhere, generally speaking.


00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.720
So yeah, very interesting.


00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.560
All right, let's--


00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.440
- It's a cool service they've done


00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.600
for the community for that.


00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:12.400
- Yeah, it's very easy to just kind of get started.


00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.640
'Cause tracing that sort of


00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.320
very partial understanding of Python,


00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.480
what comes with that is also a partial understanding


00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.560
of Linux, a partial understanding of servers,


00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.840
partial understanding of SSH, partial,


00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.600
like all these tools that you become so familiar with


00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:30.080
to weave this stuff together.


00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.400
In the beginning, these are major roadblocks.


00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.000
You're like, how am I gonna do this thing?


00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.520
There's these steps I need to learn


00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.040
and services like that that make it real easy


00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.720
and welcoming are pretty awesome.


00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:45.120
So let's round out our conversation


00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.960
with two quick thoughts.


00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:50.480
One from both you guys.


00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.160
So you're probably seeing some really big opportunities


00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.200
that the Python ecosystem can take advantage of


00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.280
and grow around.


00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.760
And there's probably also some dangers,


00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.880
there's some threats that we should maybe be aware of.


00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.840
Russell Keefe McGee gave really interesting talk


00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.280
about Black Swan events and Python and so on


00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.040
and stuff like that.


00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.160
So what do you think, opportunities,


00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:17.840
things we should be worried about or pay attention to?


00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:22.320
- Paul, you wanna take it?


00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.720
- There's one that popped in my head.


00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.240
It may have been because you mentioned Russell's


00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.160
wonderful Black Swan talk,


00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.480
which was kind of followed in my mind


00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.240
by Lukasz Langa's PyLindenium talk,


00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:37.520
which covered some of the same territory.


00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:42.880
But what I'll talk about instead is the threat that wasn't,


00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.880
or I'll talk about a couple of threats that weren't,


00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:46.720
if that's okay.


00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.680
Is that cheating?


00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:48.520
- No, that's not fine.


00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.200
I think that's an awesome history lesson, tell us.


00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:53.520
- Yeah, I remember going to see Guido


00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.320
when he was still with Google.


00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.000
God, Barry, how long ago would that have been?


00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.560
10, 12, 10 years?


00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.560
- Yeah, at least, yeah.


00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.480
- And even at that time, I was like,


00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.600
it kind of struck me going over to go see him


00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:15.080
in downtown San Francisco that he was in the process


00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.600
of handing over the reins.


00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:20.120
How many successful projects,


00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:24.240
especially open source projects, don't outlive the founder?


00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.680
- Yeah, true, yeah.


00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:31.680
- And he's done wonderfully at that over the years.


00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:36.760
And in fact, his participation now appears to be,


00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.000
'cause I wanna, not 'cause I have to.


00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.040
- Like I'm retired, I'll wait,


00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.120
no, I'm just gonna play around.


00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:42.960
- Indeed.


00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.760
That was a threat that wasn't.


00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.600
And then another threat that wasn't.


00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.920
- Yeah, the whole formation of the steering council


00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.680
on what was gonna happen when he retired and his,


00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.960
you guys gotta figure it out, this is not on me.


00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.800
- Indeed.


00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.640
- You gotta live in what you come up with.


00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.520
- Not just who it will be, figure out actually


00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.120
what system it will be in.


00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.280
- Yeah, exactly, how it was gonna work, exactly.


00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.800
- Yeah, right.


00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.920
Which is a wonderful act of humility on his part.


00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.240
He didn't view himself as essential


00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.320
to answering that question.


00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.280
- And I think he really trusted the community


00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.960
to come up with the right answers.


00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:20.920
It was a really interesting time,


00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:24.480
and I do think that the community came together.


00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:27.720
And there was lots of discussion about how to do it,


00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.840
and it really worked out.


00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:36.840
And I think that set Python up for this kind of longevity


00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:42.160
and continued success and continued relevance in technology.


00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.600
- So then I'll do my other non-threat,


00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:49.000
and then finally give you an answer on the threat.


00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.720
Another non-threat that didn't happen was PEEK.


00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.280
- Yeah.


00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.680
- And right at the time when the PEEK should have happened,


00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.780
maybe the first PEEK should have happened,


00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:04.620
I'll, and Barry, please, in fact,


00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:06.420
I would love Michael to do a show


00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:09.300
on the actual story behind the story on this.


00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:11.140
Jessica McKellar.


00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:11.980
- Yep.


00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.300
- In the middle third of Python,


00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:18.100
the PSF and PyCon as an engine of revenue,


00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.520
and then as an engine of gender diversity.


00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:27.860
And bringing in a big, new, important, viable,


00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:32.140
lot of vitality audience into Python.


00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:36.540
Then on the way to data science doing the same thing.


00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:39.460
So at a time when it should have perhaps been cresting,


00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:42.080
it did a double dip inflection point.


00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.700
Do you wanna comment on that, Barry,


00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:46.900
before I go to an actual set?


00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:49.420
- No, but I think that's one of the wonderful things


00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.060
about the Python community.


00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:51.900
You know?


00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:55.620
And it's not just sort of, I mean,


00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:57.180
it's not just on a gender.


00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:01.060
Like, it's also, you know, getting young people involved.


01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:01.900
- Sure.


01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.300
- I think that's been a fantastic thing,


01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.660
is to go to PyCon and see, you know,


01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:10.660
kid, like, you know, secondary school kids,


01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:14.380
and how it's being taught in colleges.


01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.220
And I've always--


01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:18.860
- Your son and my son went to the young coders on a--


01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:19.700
- Yep.


01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:20.540
- A long time ago.


01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:21.700
- I have to tell you, I have to tell you,


01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:26.300
I'm super proud 'cause my son is actually working in,


01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:27.900
he's using Python at work these days.


01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.820
So it's like, yes, it's awesome.


01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:30.660
- That's fantastic.


01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.060
- We're gonna be out earning you pretty soon, Barry.


01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:33.900
- Hopefully.


01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.580
- One could hope as a parent, right?


01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.420
- Exactly.


01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:42.420
- So my actual threat will go back to Russell and Lukas,


01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:46.620
and man, I worry about Python in the web.


01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:49.580
I worry that what we've said is we've ceded


01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.580
the user interface to JavaScript frameworks in the browser.


01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.800
And we're perfectly happy just shoving REST and JSON to them.


01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.380
And what worries me is--


01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:03.500
- They might just decide like,


01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.860
why are we doing this other stuff?


01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:06.120
We're almost all the way there.


01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.460
Like, let's just, come on, let's just go express--


01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.660
- If you're a business decision maker,


01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.860
and you're like, okay, I've got two teams.


01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.460
Why don't we got two teams?


01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:17.340
And the one I value is the one that puts the pixels


01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.380
that are sexy.


01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.900
- They show me the shiny buttons and bits.


01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:21.740
Yeah.


01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.500
- And then as this modern web stuff kicks in


01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.860
and website performance really, really, really


01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:29.420
becomes a thing and people pre-render on the server.


01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.380
So your React components have to be pre-rendered


01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.820
on the server, which means you have to run React


01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:38.660
on the server and you can't run React in Python.


01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:39.500
So--


01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.320
- Interesting, right.


01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.160
The pressure to make it not--


01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.900
- That's the one I've been a long time thinking about.


01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.820
- Make it not load with empty curly braces


01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.060
and then pop in all of a sudden.


01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.180
Yeah, interesting.


01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.160
Okay.


01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.020
Yeah, that's a concern, yeah.


01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.660
- I think the other thing that I'll add


01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:55.620
is Python on mobile, right?


01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:59.040
Like everybody's got a phone in their pocket,


01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:04.340
and Python doesn't have a super great story there.


01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:08.260
Things like, we have MicroPython, which has its place,


01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:13.980
as smart homes, as IOT, and all those things


01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.860
become more and more important in our lives.


01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.260
I think Python needs to have a better story


01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:20.600
for mobile as well.


01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.600
So those are two big challenges.


01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.480
- Yeah, if you're gonna ask me to make that,


01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.640
I guess I would have said mobile as well.


01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:32.120
I think the saving grace there maybe


01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.440
is that mobile's so messed up also.


01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.120
Like there's, it's so tricky.


01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.280
You've got these different languages,


01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.560
but they have these weird constraints,


01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.000
and then you've gotta go through the app store gatekeeper


01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
people and that's real, like, it's less of a straight--


01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.120
- It's a more narrow ecosystem because you basically


01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.840
have to-- - Exactly, but it's also


01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.080
one of the most important ones, right?


01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.240
I mean, it's where the really, really interesting stuff


01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.080
is these days.


01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:00.000
A couple of comments from the livestream,


01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.640
Robert Robinson says, "I'd love to have learned Python


01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.760
"in the mid-90s when I started learning programming.


01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.240
"My life would be totally different now."


01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.360
And John Sheehan says, "The item project


01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.480
"looks really interesting."


01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.820
Yeah, indeed.


01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:18.560
All right, well, those are the downer sides of things.


01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.120
Paul, one thing I would like to say about the web,


01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.760
I do feel like there's a really interesting resurgence


01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.640
in the Python web frameworks.


01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.520
Now that the Python 3, that it was sort of crossed over,


01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.760
and they're like, let's just take advantage


01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.000
of all the modern Python goodies.


01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.600
- Yes. - Things like FastAPI,


01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.920
Starlet, as well as some other ones like Django Ninja


01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.320
and whatnot are coming along to do interesting things


01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.000
that make it feel really refreshing to do Python web stuff.


01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.280
And I still think there's interesting things


01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.480
that are happening there that are compelling.


01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.240
I was talking to somebody, I can't remember the context,


01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.520
but they had a Django system,


01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.280
and some of the Django views were regular Python,


01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.280
but they actually did some of them in Cython


01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.960
'cause they had really high performance requirements.


01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.080
And the views were computed in Cython,


01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.200
which is, I mean, these are really interesting use cases


01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.400
that are out there.


01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.040
All right, really quick, we're running low on time.


01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.760
Opportunities, what do you guys see as the big opportunity?


01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.880
- That's a great question,


01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.840
because I think it also comes into sort of predicting


01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.200
where technology is going in the next few years.


01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.360
And I don't really know that I can do that.


01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.000
I mean, I've been surprised over and over and over again


01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:34.840
in my career.


01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:39.840
So again, I really think it comes down to,


01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.160
the appeal of Python the language.


01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.360
And really, one of the things I think Guido did,


01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.320
back in the Jython days when JPython was the thing


01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.880
and that became Jython,


01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:00.600
was he recognized the need to sort of separate


01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.920
the language evolution from the implementation.


01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.160
Now, the reality is,


01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.640
we've had multiple implementations of Python over the years,


01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.920
and essentially, you see Python


01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.920
is still the most popular version.


01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.680
But it doesn't have to be that way.


01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:21.680
And I think, as big companies have more and more Python


01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:29.600
in their ecosystem of technology,


01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.600
I think it becomes more imperative for them


01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:37.600
to kind of step up and help fund those kind of,


01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.600
like, I really think if we could just hit


01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.720
some of those big people, big companies that we talked about,


01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.680
get a million dollars from each of them,


01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.960
man, you could do some really incredible stuff with Python.


01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:53.200
- And they would benefit way more than that million dollars.


01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.280
- Totally.


01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.120
- Right?


01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:55.960
- Yeah.


01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.280
- Especially in Wall Street.


01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:01.120
If you could make their trades one millisecond quicker,


01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.920
boom, like that's just like printing money right there.


01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.280
- What can't they do?


01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.560
Hire people fast enough.


01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:11.000
So make your current people more productive.


01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.360
- Exactly.


01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.800
And there's no reason why it can't be done.


01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.000
Like I said, we have the organization


01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.920
because the PSF is solid and knows how to do this,


01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.240
knows how to manage these projects, right?


01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.480
Is a non-for-profit, so there's no favoritism


01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.440
going on there.


01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.840
We have the technologists who can make this happen.


01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:31.680
So--


01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.760
- The track record to show that they can do it.


01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.600
- Exactly.


01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:39.080
So I think, to me, that is the biggest opportunity.


01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.160
And if I saw that come together,


01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.080
and those are some of the things that PSF


01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.080
and the Steering Council are trying to put together.


01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:50.640
So that is so exciting because it could be an amazing


01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.680
25 years of more Python.


01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.800
- Yeah, absolutely.


01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:59.040
So I'll throw one out there for you all.


01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.360
For a while, there was this language called Java,


01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.600
you guys talked about it.


01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.720
And that would seem to be the language


01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.720
of the first year computer science program.


01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.160
When I did computer science, I took a couple of classes,


01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.000
my degree is in math,


01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.440
but I took a couple of computer science classes


01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.040
and that was Scheme and Lisp,


01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.760
which I don't feel was the best option necessarily,


01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.880
but that's what I did.


01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.720
But for a long time, it was Java.


01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:27.240
I think the big opportunity is so many people


01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.760
are learning Python from the very beginning


01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:34.920
that now it's in this place of,


01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.160
well, why not Python instead of why Python, right?


01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.720
If you're already working, you're already comfortable,


01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.840
you've already done projects in it, you've had success.


01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.760
Like, well, yeah, I could use other languages, but why not?


01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.360
One thing that I think is really interesting


01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.000
about this Stack Overflow trends


01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.520
I have up on our screen shares,


01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:55.520
do you notice how there's two humps every year for Java?


01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.440
And a lot of the other ones, they don't have those humps,


01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.960
but Java has two humps a year.


01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.560
Those are fall semester and spring semester.


01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.080
How interesting.


01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.960
Those humps are going away at the end a little bit.


01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.600
So they're kind of coming into the Python world.


01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.280
So I think it's really interesting.


01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:17.200
I think that's the opportunity is for the communities.


01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.520
There's many fresh and excited young people coming in,


01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.920
much like your survey showed


01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.480
that professional coding experience,


01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.240
the most common option was less than a year


01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.120
for Python developers, right?


01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.600
So there's a lot of fresh and exciting people coming in,


01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.720
and I think that's all good.


01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.120
I'll give an opportunity that's similar to that,


01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.040
which is also non-technical, which is people oriented,


01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.040
which is in the most recent Python Bytes,


01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:47.520
Brian used a clever expression about the long tails


01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.600
getting fatter or something like that.


01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.720
I can't remember what the context was about.


01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.600
The PSF diversity inclusion working group.


01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:02.200
Expanding the footprint of Python in next level,


01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.560
level markets and populations and groupings of people


01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.400
with passions and interests.


01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.360
- Yeah.


01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.200
- Yeah.


01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.160
- Those-


01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.000
- I think that-


01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:16.840
- Yeah, go ahead.


01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:17.680
- No, no, I was just gonna say,


01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.760
these are all really super important things


01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.320
because Paul and I have been involved in Python


01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.360
for a long time, right?


01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.360
Like, and as Guido retired, someday, hopefully, right?


01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.080
And I think it's really important.


01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.840
Like, I feel the responsibility more and more


01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.280
to help mentor younger people who are coming into,


01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.280
you know, technology in general,


01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.760
but also into the Python community


01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.520
and really nurture that engagement


01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:52.360
because that's the energy that's gonna, you know,


01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.920
propel Python forward, so, you know.


01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.760
- And Michael, I gotta give you a pat on the back.


01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:00.240
You've become a place to give a voice


01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.400
to the next generation of stores.


01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.680
So, Guido's here for that.


01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.520
- Yeah, thank you so much.


01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.360
That's really nice.


01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.000
- Yeah, absolutely.


01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.520
- I think one of the things that I've tried to do


01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.720
is to try to find people


01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.440
that have really interesting stories


01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.160
of, like, how Python has, like, massively empowered them,


01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.080
even if they haven't built


01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.960
the most popular open source project


01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.360
or they don't work at the biggest company.


01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.560
Sometimes that story of, you know,


01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:26.480
nothing to something really powerful,


01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.920
even though not too many people know about it,


01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.680
is really quite amazing, so.


01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:30.520
- Yeah.


01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.280
- Yeah, try to tell that.


01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.560
Speaking of the education side,


01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.120
RJL says, "At our science center,


01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.760
we teach Python to STEM students, grades five to eight."


01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.160
It's been really successful. - You're the hero.


01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.800
- Yeah, man, awesome. - Yeah, wow.


01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.520
Yeah, yeah.


01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.800
- All right, guys, for the sake of time,


01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.560
I'm gonna cut our final two questions


01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.480
down to one question each.


01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.680
Barry, I'm gonna give it to you first


01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.000
'cause you're a bit of an unknown.


01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.160
Paul, I'll see if I can guess his answer.


01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.560
If you're gonna write some Python code,


01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.800
what editor do you use?


01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.680
- Emacs.


01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.120
- Emacs, right on.


01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.800
- Sorry, Paul. (laughs)


01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.520
- I expect nothing less, Barry.


01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.960
- All right, Paul, what are you feeling?


01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.960
What are you doing these days?


01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:10.760
- I have PyCharm open right now.


01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.600
- Do you?


01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.800
Awesome, fantastic.


01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.640
Yeah, I don't have it open now,


01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.760
but I'm loving that you guys built it for the M1.


01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.720
It's so nice to work with these days.


01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.560
Yeah, very good.


01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.400
It's a great tool.


01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.640
I think it's really good for helping people get into it,


01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.560
but also, like, it scales as well.


01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.400
It's great.


01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.040
- Well, to speak for other products as well,


01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.080
we're seeing the rise of smart editors


01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.680
and smart tool chains for Python.


01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.160
I think that's fantastic for everybody and all of us.


01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.560
- Yeah.


01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.560
It's really cool.


01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:47.560
I mean, I acknowledge my minority status as an Emacs user,


01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.960
even in like the tech space.


01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.680
Like, there's many more Vim users,


01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:57.680
but I can see my colleagues at work,


01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.280
you know, what they use.


01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.960
And it's really fantastic to see, like,


01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.840
all the amazing support that these modern editors have


01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.560
for Python.


01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.400
- Yeah, I agree.


01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.320
They take some of these ideas like type hints and stuff


01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.640
and like amplify their value.


01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.720
- Yeah, and integration with, you know,


01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.000
static checkers and linters and mypy type checkers


01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.800
and, you know, all that kind of stuff.


01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.040
It's like, those are really important tools


01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.160
for the modern Python, you know, developer.


01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.520
And it's great to see all that stuff really well integrated.


01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.760
- Yeah, fantastic.


01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.080
Well, thank you both for being on the show.


01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.520
You want to give a final thought,


01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.720
a final comment to the people out there


01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.120
thinking on this historical sort of arc


01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.400
that we've been covering?


01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.520
What do you want to say?


01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.840
- You want to go first, Barry?


01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.680
- Sure.


01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.920
I'll say this, Python is where it is today


01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:56.320
because of the people who have gotten involved


01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.200
over the years, right?


01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.640
And, you know, I talked to some folks who are like,


01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:05.000
well, I don't know, I can't, I don't know C,


01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.120
so I can't be involved in Python development.


01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.480
No, that's not true.


01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.720
In fact, you don't even need to be a programmer


01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.240
necessarily to be involved in Python development.


01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.760
Everybody is welcome and everybody's valued.


01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.440
So if you like Python, get involved.


01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.840
That might be with the PSF,


01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:24.400
it might be with the language design, whatever it is.


01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.120
- I mean, your favorite open source project


01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.400
that's not strictly under CPython.


01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.680
- Exactly, exactly.


01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.960
All these things are available to anybody.


01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.640
There's no cost other than an internet connection


01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.840
and, you know, in a browser or an editor


01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.320
or something like that.


01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.720
Everybody can get involved.


01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.080
And I really encourage,


01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.960
I encourage everyone to sort of change the mindset of,


01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.400
these are the barriers,


01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.560
so therefore I can't get involved to,


01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.360
these are the opportunities that I can shine


01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.840
and grow and learn.


01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.960
And so I think, you know, it's the people,


01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.520
it always comes down to the folks.


01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.680
- That's a great sentiment.


01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.280
Paul?


01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.360
- Maybe in a similar vein,


01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.960
thinking about 1994 and driving back from girls


01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.640
across practice to come be on the show.


01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.840
I was thinking about, you know, most people in their lives,


01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.720
they'll have something they're really passionate about,


01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:24.040
but then a decade passes and their life changes


01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.680
and they have kids or something.


01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.920
- Gotta buy like a red convertible.


01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.200
- So they change over to something else.


01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.040
- Yeah, yeah.


01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.280
- And then their kids move out of the house


01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.400
and their passion changes to something else.


01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.040
So during these decades of their lives,


01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:41.920
they really latch onto something, believe deeply in it.


01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.200
It's part of their identity, but then they move on.


01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.160
And I think about for Barry and me,


01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:53.720
and I get to be on the show with a fluffle,


01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:58.080
and it's wonderful, a friendly language uncle for life.


01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:02.520
And I've gone through those three decades,


01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:07.520
and still, if I was to self-assess who I am,


01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.160
what's my identity, who's my tribe, it's Python and the web.


01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.720
And it's still the thing I believe in,


01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.400
is how lucky am I?


01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.240
- Yeah. - I mean,


01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:21.240
that's just a graceful way to have the years go by.


01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:24.800
- Yeah, yeah, hear, hear Paul.


01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.160
It's been an amazing journey,


01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.040
that's not over yet, hopefully.


01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:35.160
And Python gave me a life, it really did.


01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:40.400
So I'm so grateful to the language, the community,


01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:44.280
to Guido, to everybody, Paul, everybody that I meet,


01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.560
you know, Python's really an amazing,


01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.120
been an amazing experience, a great ride.


01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.000
- It's one of those types of things you can wake up and go,


01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.200
I get to do this, like I don't have to do this.


01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.520
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.640
- Can you believe I get to do this?


01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.480
They're gonna pay me for this,


01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.680
I would have done this for free.


01:15:58.680 --> 01:15:59.680
- Yeah. - That kind of stuff.


01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:00.560
Yeah, it's fantastic.


01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.800
All right, well, let's leave it there.


01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.920
Thank you both for being on the show.


01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.280
It's been really great to chat. - Michael, thank you so much.


01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.400
- Thank you for having us.


01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.680
- Yeah, it's been great. - Thank you, thank you.


01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:09.520
Cheers.
