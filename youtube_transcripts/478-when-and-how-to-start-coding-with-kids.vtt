WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.640
Anna Lena, welcome back to Talk Python to Me.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.720
It's awesome to have you here.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.540
Yeah.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.700
Thanks for having me again.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.620
Yeah.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.100
It's always fun to have you on.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.960
You've got interesting and playful topics.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.820
I think the very first time that you were on the show, I can't remember how many

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.220
years ago, but it's been a little while, was to talk about learning Python through

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.960
Harry Potter.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.500
Is that right?

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.780
In the magical universe.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.420
Yeah.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.920
I still love that project a lot.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.540
Yeah.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.300
People can find that on GitHub and they obviously can find the episode on

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.220
talkpython.fm.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.780
But we're back for, I would say another playful episode in a sense, right?

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.460
Continuing the theme.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.340
I'm going to talk about when should you teach kids to program and maybe even more

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.660
importantly, what are some age appropriate resources that spans a good chunk of what

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.780
a kid's life is, you know, like, is it kid, not a kid at 18?

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.220
I don't know.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.940
But lower than that, a lot of resources.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.460
Exactly.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.860
Yeah.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.020
So that's going to be a lot of fun.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.620
It has been a while since you've been on the show though.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.780
So just a quick introduction about who you are and what you do for everyone listening.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.780
Yeah, actually not much has changed since the last episode.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.900
I think that was on Python packaging.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.620
I'm still a senior machine learning engineer at a German company called Innovex

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.620
where I jump from project to project.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.440
I'm currently working at the speech recognition team at Bubble still.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.160
Was that last time as well?

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.720
I think so.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.320
I believe so.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.800
Yes.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.760
So, yeah, I'm still there in the project.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.320
I love it.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.160
It's very interesting topic.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.520
And yeah, I love Python.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.200
We have talked about different topics over the years and this time it's on children.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.760
And yeah, a talk I prepared for PyData and the PyCon here in Germany.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.240
And it was lots of fun to learn about it.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.800
Yeah.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.880
It looks like you did a lot of research to go into this.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.640
And I think it's probably worth pointing out that we both are parents.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.120
And so we have some interest in this topics, you know, close to home as well.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.480
My kids are getting a little bit older for any of this kind of guidance, but still,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.600
you know, a lot of things I thought about as they were growing up and some of these

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.360
things we're going to talk about I've actually used, you know, before I saw them

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.920
on your list as well, which is cool, but yeah, it's a personal topic, I suppose.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.200
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.240
For me, it's also personal because I did not have any coding opportunities growing

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.960
up myself, and I really want this to be different for children growing up now and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.720
my own kids.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.400
So, that's also a reason why I wanted to do the research so that it would be just

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.920
different.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.200
Let me know what you think.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.440
But I feel like there are social stigmas, like this person should be a coder and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.840
that person shouldn't be a coder.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.160
They should go do something else.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.920
And that may or may not be around gender, but often it is, unfortunately.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.760
But when you're six years old, you don't care.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.760
You like games, you want to play a game, you want to explore, things are

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.560
interesting, right?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.600
So, I feel like this kind of stuff also has a big opportunity to short circuit

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.720
these unnecessary influences, I guess, depending on different cultures.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.520
And also just having it in your environment, if there's like a person in

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.320
your family or your friend circle, or even at school and you have some

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.280
opportunity to learn about it, it helps a lot.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.000
For me, it just wasn't a topic ever.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.960
And I still remember my parents when I told them that I was switched to computer

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.600
science in my graduate degree, they were like, "Are you sure you want to do that?

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.840
Isn't that like very nerdy, techie stuff?"

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.960
And I'm so happy I did the switch, even though it was quite hard in the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.080
beginning, but it's an amazing topic and there's so much cool stuff to do.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.440
It's just not only the nerdy stuff.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.360
It's always got something new.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.360
That's both the benefit and the curse of it.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.760
What you've learned is powerful and helpful, but there's more to learn.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.080
Yeah, always.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.600
But that makes, like, keeps it interesting, right?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.880
You never get bored.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.080
Exactly.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.880
Especially in JavaScript.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.120
Okay.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.760
So I feel like as your parents had that thought, you know, probably

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.040
one thing they may have thought, I didn't know, obviously I don't know them,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.200
but a lot of people would think is that's a very antisocial sort of thing, right?

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.840
Like, "Oh, you're going into programming.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.720
That means you're going to sit behind a computer screen completely alone

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.880
and not talk to people," and I think that's one of the misconceptions of programming.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.400
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.360
Yeah.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.320
I, like, even now when I'm working remotely, most of the time I have so many

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.320
meetings and collaborations with other developers and I don't ever feel not

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.200
part of my team, even if I don't see them because we interact so much.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.440
And sometimes they sit on a complete different continent and it still feels

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.520
very close and we do laugh and we don't only pair code, but we, like, yeah,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.600
you get to know them well and it's lots of fun, interesting people that are

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.600
not the stereotype of coders.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.600
Yeah.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.080
Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.520
I bring that up because I think some people listening might be attracted to

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.640
this show who don't necessarily work as programmers themselves, you know?

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.200
I can very, like, I can recommend it a lot.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.720
I think it's a lot of fun.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.440
Absolutely.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.720
All right.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.000
Well, we talked about some of the reasons that we're interested in this,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.720
obviously, but why?

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.880
I mean, as people who like programming, we may want to communicate or share

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.160
that thing we like with other kids, with our kids and so on, but I think

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.560
programming also can stand in for a lot of more traditional things, such

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.480
as, like, geometry and so on.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:19.400
Yeah, for me, I think what I like most about it is that you can really make

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.760
things, you can see them come alive and it can be a game, it can be something

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.440
more math related, it can be music, websites, you can just create anything

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.960
that you're interested in and even have so much fun seeing it come to life.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:43.280
So it's not just learning a skill, maybe for a job or your, like, your life at

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.040
home or your hobbies, but it's more of, like, being able to create anything

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.080
that you're interested in.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.040
And then of course you have the obvious advantages, like the career

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.360
opportunities and lots of skills that are taught by learning how to code that

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.680
you do not think about in the beginning, I guess.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.840
Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:10.680
The realism or the, I've created something I can see, even though it's

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.160
still digital and virtual and you can't actually touch it usually, unless it's

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.040
like robotic or something, but that's so much more realistic and interactive

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.240
than things like, "Oh, you're going to learn these axioms and then we're going

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:31.200
to teach you how to prove stuff about angles and triangles with these axioms."

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.840
It's going to teach you logical thinking.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.440
So, you know, sit down for the year and we're going to talk about small

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.640
angles, big angles, you know, diagonal, cross connected, all that kind of stuff.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:43.840
Right.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.920
Which is a little bit useful, but being able to work with computers is way more.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.640
And I think it teaches these problem solving and computational

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.600
thinking skills at least as well.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.920
Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.040
Especially what you said, like problem solving, logical thinking that kids,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.520
like not only adults, but kids especially, they understand that you might have a

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.520
complex problem you want to solve, but you can break it down into simpler steps.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.160
Like what an algorithm is actually doing, giving you a step-by-step

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.800
path to reaching a goal.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:21.800
And you can teach that not only by coding, also, of course, by just playing and seeing

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:27.480
you want to build this huge Lego piece, but you start building it with little

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.000
pieces and put it all together.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.200
And that's also what you have in coding.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.040
You want to reach a goal, you want to program a game or maybe create an

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:44.000
animation and you understand how to break it down and yeah, it helps us or also

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.800
kids to make more structured decisions.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.360
Yeah.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.320
I think that's a very valuable skill to learn, not only for coding, but for

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.440
everyday life, I guess.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.400
Yeah.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.480
Being able to break problems down and solve them.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.680
I mean, that's like adulthood right there.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:08:59.680
Yeah.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.680
What I also find really helpful is one of the skills I looked at specifically

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.240
is perseverance and also for kids, they get frustrated so easily and give up and

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.600
say like, this is not working.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.400
I don't like this.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.440
Like I hate this and start throwing their toys around.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.560
At least we are at this stage.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.520
And your kids are probably not doing that anymore.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.480
But yeah, I think with coding, when you encourage them to keep going, even or

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.720
especially when they fail, that they understand that failure isn't something

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.360
bad, but rather it keeps you improving.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:43.440
It keeps you going and that you can learn to see challenges or problems at something

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.320
positive and something you can grow with.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.040
I think that's really, really great about coding because you will have that a

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.680
lot when you learn how to code.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.680
Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.920
I absolutely agree with you.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.360
And the problem, this perseverance skill is incredibly important.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.080
I agree.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.120
It manifests itself a little bit differently as they get older.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.800
Instead of going, I dislike this, you know, like these are those toys, crap.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.600
I can't make it do its thing or whatever.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.000
It's more, I can't do this.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.200
I'm not good at this.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.000
And a really important skill I think is not, I can't do this.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.280
Like I need to work at being good at this.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.960
And that perseverance that you learn, honestly, I think one of the very most

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.800
important skills that people can have as a programmer or in software development

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.800
in general is perseverance.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.640
Like it doesn't work.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.600
I read the docs, still doesn't work.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.200
I read Stack Overflow, people were mean, still didn't help me.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.600
But eventually, you know, I worked my way and now it works.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.720
And it's such a cool feeling to work through those things.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.440
But until you learn the perseverance, you just think, well, I wasn't good at math.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.560
I must not be good at programming.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:56.920
I'm out.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920
Yeah.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.480
Yeah.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.600
I think that keeps a lot from a lot of children to learn or to like

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.960
learning things that are hard.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:10.320
I know that lots of kids struggle with math and yes, like STEM classes.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.200
But I think it's often because they feel like I don't understand this.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.000
It might also not be explained in the best way, but they just shut down and say,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.600
okay, I'm just not going to try.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.760
And if you understand, and maybe also I know that there's this huge

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:33.600
psychological research on growth mindset that you understand that you shouldn't

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:40.120
praise just an outcome, but rather the effort that kids try to do something.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.400
They try to improve and put in the work that that's just so much more important

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.560
than reaching the goal in the end.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.520
Yeah.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:54.040
And yeah, we can really help our kids to become more robust and more joyful

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.960
about learning by teaching these principles, for example, through learning how to code.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.040
Now you did give this as this topic as a talk at PyData.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.080
Was that PyData Berlin?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.560
Where was it?

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:14.320
And I gave it once at PyData London and at PyCon Berlin and at EuroPython.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.480
Okay.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.000
Yeah.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.280
So the reason I was going to bring that up is you had some really cool pictures.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.040
Yeah, I know.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:29.480
You'd come up with like a little persistent kid working away there and stuff like that.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:29.760
Right.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.280
Oh, I love them.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.240
I love creating them.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.080
I use Delhi three to create them.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.640
And I spend so much time just playing around with a model and providing it

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.840
prompts to see which images I liked best.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.800
Of course, there were the obvious problems with some of them that the kids had six

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.880
fingers and so on, but still, it was amazing to create these images.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.800
And I love that, like the perseverance one.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.240
And we can link the article to my blog later where you can see the image.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.360
It's just, everyone laughs when they see the picture.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.800
Yeah, the pictures are great.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.560
The pictures are great.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.080
All right.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:14.240
Let's talk for a minute about brain development and maybe the different stages

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.720
that kids go through, because there's kind of four or five stages, which then you

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.760
might map over to the different types of resources that we're going to talk about.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.800
Yeah, I think that's a really important topic to consider.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.000
If you want to understand when your child is able to do certain things, then you need

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.920
to be able to understand how their brain develops because our brain matures over

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.400
time, it's not fully mature at birth, but quite the opposite.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.680
And some regions of the brain take more time to develop and some like vision and

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.080
hearing are quite well-developed already at birth.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:55.080
So at certain ages, it doesn't make sense to start coding, for example, from zero to

00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:01.920
four, and there is not much there for them to really have the cognitive abilities to

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.480
understand computational principles or really sit down and concentrate and focus.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:13.480
So, yeah, for example, at birth, you have quite a lot of neurons already, but just

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.800
25% of the adult size brain.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.120
And when you reach the age of four, you already have 80%.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.040
So it has grown a lot through the first four years.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.000
And you do have a lot of influence as a parent or caregiver, friend, whatever.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:35.000
But, yeah, mostly the primitive areas of the brain develop first, like hearing,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.840
vision, emotional regulation starts developing, but really cognitive and

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.960
executive functions like planning and so on come later.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.840
So I guess zero to four years would be or birth would be the first stage and then zero

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:56.240
to four years where you have lots of things happening and you can influence that by

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.200
positive influences from like responsive caregiving, that you have diverse learning

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.280
experiences and playing with a child.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.720
And then at four years, it starts getting interesting.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:15.240
And that's also where you can start doing things with your kid.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.320
But do you want to rather talk about the development first and then about...

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.640
Maybe we should talk about the resources that go with each stage.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.120
What do you think?

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.400
Yeah.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.480
Yeah, let's do that.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.240
That's a good idea.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.240
Yeah, I do too.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.560
Since we already reached age four now.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.600
Oh, yeah, nice.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:39.240
Yeah, so at age four, you can teach basic algorithmic thinking and which you can ask

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.360
questions like, what would you do to guide a lost puppy home?

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:48.160
Just making them start to think about how to break down problems into smaller steps.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.920
But also they have the motor skills at that age and the perceptual abilities to

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.760
interact with simple toys that teach the basics of coding.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.640
And you open the BeeBot, which is a tiny floor robot, or I guess it's not so tiny.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.480
It's a bee and it has four directions to go front, back, right, left.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.600
And then you can, I think it can remember up to 130 commands and you can press go

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.880
and program the way it's supposed to crawl or walk.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.760
However you want to phrase it.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:28.000
Yeah, so one thing you might do with this thing is, so this is a little robot that has

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.120
wheels, looks like a bee.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.240
What you do is you push the buttons like forward, forward, right, forward, left,

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.160
forward, forward.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.400
And you might put out something on the ground, like a little, like, can you make your bee

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.560
go around this thing and then through this little gate or whatever, right?

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.080
Those kinds of challenges.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.840
I think even when you purchase them, you can purchase rugs that have certain paths on

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.720
them and so on.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:01.160
I guess it's a very, you can spend a lot of money on these kinds of toys.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:07.200
But maybe as a side note, if you start looking, you will find tons of robots in

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.800
different price ranges.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.600
So I guess we will only mention examples, but if you start looking, you will definitely

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.080
find lots of different options.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.640
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:26.760
Would you say that this RoboTurtles game falls into the same category or is that a

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.400
little bit older?

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.600
Oh, I'm not sure from the top of my head if it's older.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.800
What I like about it is that it's a board game.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.680
So I'm always asked about screen-free offers.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:43.160
So something that you can play without sitting in front of the laptop because screen time

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.000
is just a general huge discussion point.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.600
But I would have to look.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.160
So if I, yeah, looking at the box here, it says ages four and up.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.840
So probably.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.600
Oh, nice.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.120
That's really cool.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:55.400
Yeah.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.560
Yeah.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.320
So this one is, I think it's almost exactly the same problem.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.600
There is a little bit more to it because there's a couple of challenges in the board

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.000
game.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.480
So I think we actually have this board game from when my daughter was young.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.320
And you have a little turtle, which is a card and a board, and you can put stuff on the

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.360
board, like little rocks.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.320
It can't go through.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.440
Maybe there's like an ice wall and it has ability to like melt the ice, but it has to

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.760
do that before it can move forward.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.440
You know, so you, you get a bunch of cards and you put them in a stack and then you like

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.560
play them out to see if your turtle wins the game or something like that.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:37.400
So this is another pretty good option at that age, especially if you want something not

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.000
electronic.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.760
Yeah.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.680
What I also like about it is that it becomes a family activity that you learn.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.600
That's just in general, a very good thing if you want to teach your kids how to code,

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.120
that you make learning a fun activity and playing games, being with them, showing

00:18:53.120 --> 00:19:00.520
interest and having fun doing it as part of gaming or what you do at home, playing board

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:00.880
games.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.440
That's just a very easy way then to get started and to get them interesting.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:13.360
I should point out like the actual Robot Turtles website has a bad SSL certificate right

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:13.600
now.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:20.840
So I'm sure you can find it on like Amazon and other places, but yeah, anyway.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.960
Okay.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.480
So what else?

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:30.040
Another one you talked about is cubelets, but this, this feels like this might be a

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:30.800
little bit older.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.840
Yeah.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.160
cubelets it's, well, you can start early with them, but you can also use them at a

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.680
later stage because you can program them using visual coding languages or one of them

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.360
may code, but you can start quite early.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.600
so yeah, these like cubelets are small physical blocks.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.280
as you can see there that you just plug together and some of them move, some have

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.000
cameras or sensors, and you can build lots of cool, unique robots with them.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.120
And if you start looking at demos on YouTube, it's really amazing, how cool they can

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.240
look, the end robot.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.280
I think one disadvantage of this is that it's quite expensive.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:18.960
So one of these blocks is about 50 euros or maybe $45, $50.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.360
So if you want to build big robots and have lots of options, then you need

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.160
to invest quite a bit of money.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:25.960
Yeah.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.720
I like that the website says free shipping on orders over 50.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.800
It's like, okay.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.920
Pretty much anything.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.120
Yeah.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120
Yeah, I guess.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:41.040
But I still, I love it because it makes you like be creative.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.800
And, especially having this aspect that you can program them later on using

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.080
Mako, that's one of the visual programming language.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.600
I think that's the run for Microsoft.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.920
you can keep using them over a long period of time.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.920
Yeah.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.880
For maybe a mental model for people who haven't seen these in action, because even

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.080
looking at the website, you'd have no idea.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.560
Like what, what do I do with these things again?

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.040
Why are they here?

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:11.200
I feel like they should have people to animation or something, but there's these

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.760
cubes as the name would imply, but they're almost like Lego blocks that each block

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.680
is programmable and then you combine them into a thing that does stuff.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.040
Right.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.360
Yeah.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.040
I think you explained it well.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.480
Yeah.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:26.880
Thanks.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.720
So I think that that's pretty interesting, but this is probably in the next stage,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.080
right?

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.480
The next stage would be maybe six to nine.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.960
What do you think?

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.800
Yeah.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.440
So, yeah, exactly.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.360
I think the next stage regarding development would be around six to nine.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.160
Of course, you also always have to mention it's, this is now for normally

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.200
developing children, just an average, every child is different.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.520
So if you observe your child, you know, which skills develop at what point and

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.960
what might be easier for them, what is harder.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.720
So this is not like hard ranges.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.520
but yeah, if you start with about six years of age, you can start

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:11.880
using visual programming tools because, kids become used to using technology.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.000
They have a better hand eye coordination.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.160
And also one very important part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, it's like

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:25.040
the CEO of our brain has a big growth spurt between five and eight, and this

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.960
improves working memory, planning, attention, and all kinds of mechanisms

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.680
that you need to start really sitting down and, code.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.120
So, yeah.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.040
you already opened Scratch Junior.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.720
Yeah.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:45.800
And Scratch Junior is, I think Scratch is quite popular.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.440
One of the most popular, visual coding languages and Scratch Junior is just a

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.160
simplified version of it for very young children starting at five to seven.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.960
It's recommended on their website.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:05.480
so it has no text, but rather actions like movement and in visual programming

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:11.400
in general, you have puzzle pieces, to represent concepts like loops usually,

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.200
or I don't know, variables, logical expressions, and you can plug them together.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.840
So you don't have to worry about syntax or using the command line.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:26.560
You just create these, programs by putting together puzzle pieces.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.360
So that's, and that happens on a visual interface.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.720
So that's what visual programming is about.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.000
And Scratch Junior is just a very simple version.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.520
I think it's just a free app.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.400
You can play on a tablet and create little programs where the

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.640
characters move around and do things.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.160
yeah.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.960
Kind of like the bee, but you more, a little closer to real programming,

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.800
but then you see the output, right?

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.240
Yeah, exactly.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:57.480
Yeah.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.680
And you start really using, I guess these plug in principles that you

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.960
have the blocks that you put together.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.280
So when you go onto, for example, Scratch or another of the visual

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:13.040
programming languages, you're already, you have knowledge about how

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.360
it works in general, I guess.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.520
Yeah.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.520
As I look at this website, I was thinking, you know, when I think about

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.640
coding, I think about computers, right?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:32.680
Mac, windows, whatever with apps, but obviously young kids are way more in

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:37.440
tune with touch devices like iPads and Android tablets and stuff, right?

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.640
It's amazing how quickly they adapt and learn it.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.160
I think it's quite, sometimes I'm blown away by how young children can

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.920
already understand how to swipe and select stuff on a touch screen.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.840
yeah.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.480
Yeah.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:58.000
I think actually it probably lowers the age by quite a bit that kids are able

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.600
to do this kind of stuff because these touch interfaces exist in decent ways.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.960
Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.840
Just, learning how to type is actually one of the main reasons why you can only

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.360
start with textual programming, later because typing is hard.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.840
You need to learn how to do it.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.920
and yeah, just touching and dragging and dropping is much easier.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.560
When my older kids were very young, we wanted to have them work with things like

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.960
this and just learn how to use computers.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.480
And they, this predated the iPhone.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.040
Like it didn't exist, right?

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.080
There was no meaningful touch screens that really you would want to use.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:43.920
And so we got like, kind of like you get a typing program to learn to touch type.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.360
We got a mousing program and there was like a little airplane and they had to

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.480
like chase the airplane around with the mouse to learn how the eye hand

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.360
coordination of, of mouse and then like screen, right.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.040
When you're three or four years old, like that's not natural, right.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.400
But touching, oh, they already be all over that.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.900
Yeah.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:06.000
I think sometimes it's even too intuitive for them.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.120
yeah, that's the problem.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:14.120
Having like having a very huge influence on them way too early, but I guess

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.200
that's a different discussion.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:15.960
Yeah.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.840
That's a different problem.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.480
That sends you back to a robot turtle board game.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.440
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:22.840
Yeah.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.200
Okay.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:30.440
So a little bit later we could do, once you start doing this, some kind of

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.120
programming language, then that opens up a bunch of resources, right?

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.600
So obviously Scratch is sort of the way more full featured version.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.080
Scratch and junior.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.040
Right.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.720
That's, that's pretty neat.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.760
Yeah.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.480
I think Scratch is amazing because it, I think for kids, it's great.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.440
I know lots of adults that still use it for some projects where you really want

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:58.480
to make it come alive because Scratch is focused on, yeah, having like really

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.160
cool, interactive, fun projects.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:08.160
They have sounds, music, you can add graphics and it's just offers a lot of

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.640
functionality to create your project, share them with friends.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.200
Yeah.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:19.680
And there is a ton of resources on learning Scratch and yeah, as you can see

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:25.320
here, like make music, create a story, create a character, your, I guess

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.000
your possibilities are endless.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.200
Yeah.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.840
It looks really, actually I didn't realize all the, all the stuff they got going

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:36.640
here, they have a bunch of tutorials, free coding community, super cool.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.040
Then I guess just while we're talking on these visual programming languages, we

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.320
could talk about Blockly, right?

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.520
Yeah.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:49.240
When I, like I knew Blockly existed, it is also free, like Scratch is also free.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.080
I guess that's important to mention.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.360
And Blockly is actually at the basis of most of the other visual languages.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:01.120
For example, it is actually like block-based languages like Scratch and

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.720
MakeCode are based on Blockly.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.880
Blockly is developed by Google.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:13.080
And with Blockly, it's, I think it's for a bit older kids because it's more low

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.920
level, if you can say that it offers you more flexibility, you see the code next

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.760
to the blocks, you see it in an editor, how it actually looks like, and you could

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:26.320
copy paste the code into like a normal editor and run it.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:34.400
And so, yeah, it's more low level, but also somewhat more sophisticated, the

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:40.280
editor that you have it more, it looks more like coding to me than Scratch.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:46.120
I think maybe the way to think about it, you say it's more low level.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:55.560
I would say each block almost corresponds to a single symbol of code, almost, right?

00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:01.480
Like you have a set variable too, and then you put another block on, which is the

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.000
value, and then you've got your visual editor, but then like side by side, you

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.640
have your JavaScript, or I imagine you could probably see Python or other

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:14.240
languages if you, there's a dropdown for choosing the output language, but yeah.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:14.640
It's-

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.320
- You can use JavaScript, Python, PHP, Lua, or Dart.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.040
- Interesting.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.080
Okay.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:22.240
Yeah.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.720
So that's kind of getting a little farther up there and maybe we could talk a bit

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:34.320
about the hardware side, because that's one way that it actually can be something

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.320
you can touch and feel as you interact with these ideas, right?

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.160
- Yeah.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.800
I know that that's nothing I ever used, but my brother started using it.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.760
Like I know that he bought a Raspberry Pi, you open up the micro bit, which is

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.240
like a smaller programmable device.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.120
And the Raspberry Pi would be like full-fledged computer in a tiny device.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.560
But yeah, you can learn a lot about hardware and also coding

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.600
by having such devices.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.120
And the micro bit has displays, buttons, sensors, and you can program it using

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.640
make code, one of the other visual programming languages.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:18.040
And I think it's quite cheap compared to other devices, like a Raspberry Pi is.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:23.240
I think it's not expensive for having all these abilities or these capabilities.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:29.040
But the micro bit is, I guess, more affordable for lots of people.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.640
Oh yeah, nice.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.680
There you can see how it works.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:38.920
- Oh, and you know what's really interesting is if you go to makecode.microbit.org,

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:44.960
even if you don't have one of these devices, it comes with a little emulator

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:51.000
and then it has a virtual micro bit that you can write code against.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:59.640
And it gives you an option as well to choose Python or Blockly or some other way

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.080
of working with it, which is pretty cool.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.680
- Yeah, exactly.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.480
That's also why it's recommended for children, like officially it's recommended

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.160
for children at the age of eight or older.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.360
And Blockly, I think is even recommended for kids starting at 10.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:19.240
Yeah, whereas Scratch is for even younger children, right?

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.280
They say you can get started at eight.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.640
And they say, I think, which is funny, they say it's up to 16, which doesn't

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.800
make sense to me, why would there be an upper limit?

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.680
But yeah, anyway, you can still-

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.880
- Sorry, you're 17, you have to do C++ now.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.880
- Yes, exactly.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.680
Also, I think what is great about visual programming is that you can always come

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.960
back to it, it's not that you progress from these robots to visual programming

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:49.520
to textual programming, but you can use visual programming for doing, I don't know,

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.120
digital stories, and you can still do textual programming at work.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.680
Yeah, it's just having all these options now is really nice.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.080
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.320
Let's see, we also have Zoomie.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.320
Zoomie is pretty cool.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.120
Let's come back to Zoomie.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.760
I do want to talk about something that's a little bit more real similar to the

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.320
micro bit first, is many of the things over at Adafruit.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.560
Are you a fan of Adafruit?

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.200
- I don't know Adafruit, tell me about it.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:24.080
- So this is a company that creates a whole bunch of small devices like the BBC

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.440
micro bit that runs CircuitPython.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:36.720
So there's just tons and tons of things you can buy.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:44.440
You can buy little sensors and you can buy little E-ink displays or whatever it is

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.280
that you're looking for.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:51.280
And there's just many, many little ways to make these projects a little bit more

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.120
than a micro bit.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:57.040
So for example, you could get one of these ESP32 devices, but it has like a little

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:05.280
tiny display on it that you can output your text to and it costs $19.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.920
You know what I mean?

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.520
Which is pretty ridiculous.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.760
And they often come with tutorials on how to do it.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:18.240
So if you're into this kind of stuff, this is a perfect place to go look.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.120
- Yeah.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.680
Also, there's just so much opportunity to learn even for being the parent.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.320
I would learn so much from doing this.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:31.200
It would be so valuable to me to learn more about the hardware side of things,

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.920
especially because I would never sit down and buy myself a Raspberry Pi

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.760
I don't know why, but I wouldn't do it.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.200
I just don't find the time.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.000
- You already have a computer and all that.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.600
- Yeah.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.200
And if I can do it together with my children, I think that's just amazing.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.240
It's really cool.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.800
And this is just a general thing about learning with kids.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.440
If you learn together with them, they can also be the expert sometimes,

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.520
which is amazing for kids.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:01.600
If they can explain something to you that they understand better, it gives them so

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:07.360
much joy and helps them develop this passion and love for learning.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.560
I think that's a great thing about learning how to code.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.120
That doesn't matter if you are the best coder, but you can just use it as a way

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.480
to improve yourself.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:17.840
- Yeah.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.720
And once they get that mastery, they're like, "Oh, now I've gone beyond them."

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.840
It's probably a really good feeling.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:29.120
- If my kids want to learn how to code early, like much earlier than myself,

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:34.160
they will become so much better than me so quickly.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.760
Yeah.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.760
- Yeah, for sure.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.520
Yeah.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.880
I have one of these little devices here.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.760
You put it in your hand.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.040
It's like certainly smaller than the palm of my hand.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.920
And this thing manages the DNS and ad blocking on my network.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.640
It was like 20 bucks or something.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.280
Yeah.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.040
So there's sort of less playful, more interesting.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:00.120
Also, just utilitarian things you can do with these little things.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:00.840
- Yeah.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.120
Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:03.680
- All right.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.560
Back to Zoomi, which is in the same age category, I would say.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.160
This is like around 10 years or so.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.680
But it's more robot-like, right?

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.560
- Yeah, exactly.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.760
Like, it's a self-driving car kit.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.520
Like, it's a small car.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.080
And it has so many capabilities.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.880
You can program it using Python and Blockly.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:32.680
And it can, yeah, like you can even teach it about driving certain ways by providing

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.880
your own datasets.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.040
So there is a lot of machine learning.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.760
Even you can teach it.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:44.360
It offers so many opportunities or ways to create projects.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.680
At my company, we have done quite a few workshops with kids with Zoomi.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.200
And they love doing it.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.200
And the adults love doing it too.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:54.600
- Nice.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.880
So it's like a self-driving car kit.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.400
So if you wanted to try to...

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:05.000
Instead of maybe teaching it, you go forward three steps, you turn right,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.280
you go forward two steps, you turn left, you teach it.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.880
If you see a turn left sign, you turn left or something like that, right?

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.360
- Yes.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:12.880
Exactly, yeah.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:18.280
It can really understand or analyze its environment.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.080
- Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.520
Okay.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.320
And you do events with these?

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.440
- Yeah.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.280
That's also maybe advice for people that want to get started.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.600
It's always useful to check out local events that happen at companies that are

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.760
close to where you live or universities.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.480
They do offer a lot of free...

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.080
Often offer free workshops for kids where you can sign them up to learn

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.640
about robotics or coding.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:52.000
And it can be like an easy way to get them started if you find it hard

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.200
to do it yourself.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:54.800
- Yeah.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:00.480
I think a lot, at least in the US, there's quite a few programs for like

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:06.840
summer teen programs that do like either 3D printing or, you know,

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.400
coding with, you know, Lego robots or whatever.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.680
So there's a lot of summer camps and that type of things.

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.640
- Yeah.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.040
I guess that's very big in the US.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.640
In Germany, I think not so much.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.400
Maybe it's growing.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:27.040
But yeah, you can definitely spend a lot of time doing it.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:33.760
I know that like we at our company, we sometimes offer day workshops where

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:39.880
you can just start getting to know about a topic or just play around with things,

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.400
becoming kids interested in the topic in the first place.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.680
- Yeah.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.360
Yeah, that's really neat.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.320
Last in the category of hardware here, you already mentioned it though,

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:56.920
is Raspberry Pi, which I guess is a little closer to just a real computer, right?

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.720
- Yeah.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.080
Yeah, it's a really powerful device.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.880
So it's basically a very small and cheap computer that runs Linux.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:10.400
But you can use it to learn coding, but you can also build hardware projects

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.840
with it, do home automation, learn about the Internet of Things.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.640
But it's recommended for kids starting at 11 years, so quite a bit older

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.800
because you need programming.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:28.880
And this maybe also shifts over to the next age range, namely when your kids have

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:35.240
typing skills and also a more well-developed cognitive abilities,

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.680
the prefrontal cortex, which I talked about, the CEO of the brain,

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.760
the development starts to mature and stabilize.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.160
So planning, organizing, thinking abstractly, all these skills become

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.840
more fully developed.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:53.720
And you, of course, need the typing skills to get started with textual coding.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:39:01.040
So at the age 9 plus, most of the time, you can get started with these things.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:08.120
For example, with like programming Raspberry Pi or just more traditional

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.520
textual programming languages.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.360
- Yeah.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.840
Yeah.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.400
The typing skills is pretty interesting, I think.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:23.920
You know, one that I know you've talked about before, but I think is also super

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.840
interesting as a gateway to this, this is the best one that I know,

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:33.760
maybe people know of others as well, is Code Combat.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.520
- You did a podcast episode on it.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.720
- Yeah.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.480
This is one of the ones, like my daughter and I both subscribed to this for a while

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.040
when she was younger.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.520
And we'd go through and we did, I don't know, like, I can't remember,

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.560
I think she did 30 or 40 code challenges through there or something like that,

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.320
which was pretty awesome.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.040
And I also had the guys on the show, yeah.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:56.880
It's been a little while.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.640
- Yeah.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.760
Yeah, it has been.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.000
But it's still, I think it's an amazing resource.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.360
So you, Code Combat is about learning how to code through gaming.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.720
So you play a game from beginning to end.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:11.560
And while you play the game, you learn to code in Python or JavaScript.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:16.560
I think there are several languages, but you really do textual programming.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.640
And if your kid likes gaming or this is something that makes it easier for them

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.360
to get started with coding, it's an amazing resource, even though you have

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.960
to pay for it because you're really guided through the course,

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.080
you can have lessons.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:33.080
You can even have, I think, teacher lessons once or twice a week,

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.280
dependent on your subscription plan.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.280
- Yeah.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.880
I think there might be a free tier if you tell it you're a student,

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.560
but you can only do certain challenges.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.680
Like, for example, see this, there's like a locks here and it says,

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:53.640
I think, yeah, I have to subscribe to this if I want to solve all the puzzles.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.280
But there's some of them you can do for free, I believe.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.840
I don't feel like we had to pay at the beginning,

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.080
but they could have changed their model.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.920
- No, I think I also played around with it,

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.880
but at least in the beginning, you can try it out for free.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.880
- Yeah.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.520
What I really like about this, you know, so if you click on...

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.520
If you go to this, you click on one of the things, it says,

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.240
for this challenge, you're going to learn arguments and syntax.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.960
Or if you come over here and you click on this one,

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.080
it'll say you'll learn while loops or whatever.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:27.120
But then it gives you just a nice, simple challenge.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.120
So, but what's cool...

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.280
Oh, no, in order to play that one, I got to...

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.320
Can I play this one?

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.320
Yeah, here you go.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.480
So you have this character and what's...

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.680
Oh, my gosh, I made that very large.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.360
What's really cool though is when you...

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.520
It gives you a little hint, but the editor...

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.280
Here's what I think is special about Code Combat.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.160
The editor is autocomplete like you have never seen.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.240
You know what I mean?

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.640
So it says, all right, what you need to do is build a fence.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.000
And you have a hero and the hero has the ability to say,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.680
build at X, Y position, or it could move.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.000
And if I just type the letter D,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.560
it'll autocomplete like hero.move down.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.920
Or if I say hero build X, Y,

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.240
it automatically puts in all the...

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.280
So if you can type just a couple of characters,

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.600
it'll keep the syntax,

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.160
like the spacing for indentation and block definitions.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.160
And all of that kind of stuff is ridiculous for how...

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.360
You don't even have to really have the right syntax.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.680
You just have to put a little bit of some kind of word

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:37.680
in there at all, and it'll start to write all of it for you,

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.320
which I think that's the magic here.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.320
- It's nice that you have this insider knowledge

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.000
by having tried it out yourself for quite a while.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.080
- Yeah, it worked way better than other stuff

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.880
when my daughter was young and I was trying to teach her

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.440
like beyond the visual programming things.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.200
But it's so forgiving compared to,

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.160
well, here's your favorite editor and you start typing,

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.000
oh, why won't it run?

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.320
There's three spaces, not four.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.680
Oh, I see.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.720
All that kind of detail you gotta normally deal with.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.080
- Yeah, it can be so frustrating in the beginning

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.360
if you need to learn about everything at the same time,

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.160
like syntax, spacing, brackets.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.720
And it's just a lot to learn in the beginning

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.520
if you just want to understand the basic concept

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.240
like for a start.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.120
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:30.200
Another thing you put out there was Code Club.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.080
- Yeah, that's I think a really cool resource

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.440
by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.960
So it's a platform and it guides your kids

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.400
from lesson to lesson.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.800
So you start with learning Scratch,

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.480
but then it progresses onto Python.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:52.480
And yeah, you can start, I think at the age of eight.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.240
Yeah, you can start at the age of eight,

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:59.080
which is also the recommended age for Scratch.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.040
And this is just an example for a full platform

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.440
that you can use to guide yourself or your children

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.520
through progressing from one thing to the other.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.320
And I think it's also free.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.480
So if you start looking,

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:17.160
there are lots of online coding classes that you can use

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:21.640
that teach you different things

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.480
and have a whole program and sets of ideas

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.960
behind how to approach different topics.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.400
- Yeah, this looks very fun.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.360
And the example, at least they have on the screen

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.720
is using Blockly, right?

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.640
Or Scratch, one of them.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.040
- I think it's Scratch.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.040
Yeah, I think level one is Scratch

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.840
and then level two would be Python

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.200
and more comes after that.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.600
- Yeah, that's really cool.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.880
Another one in this realm is Hedi.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.560
I had not heard of Hedi.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.120
- Yeah, me neither.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.320
Just when I started researching the topic,

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.520
why I chose it as an example

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:02.400
is that I just like the concept of gradual programming.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.760
So gradual programming means that,

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.320
what I just mentioned basically,

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.680
that if you learn language, speaking,

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.800
or like a programming language,

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.120
you have to learn a lot at the same time.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.160
It can be overwhelming.

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.760
You have concepts like loops, if-else,

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.080
and syntax like quotation marks, round brackets.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.000
And in Hedi, it's free.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.680
Like it's a web-based interface

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.000
and your concepts are introduced

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.240
with as little syntax and then refined.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.280
So in the beginning, you can just type print and the text

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.680
and you don't have to worry

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.640
about quotation marks or brackets.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.520
It's just introduced at a later stage.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.400
So it mimics the way in which we would learn a language.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.000
And in the end, it's based on Python.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.480
So you learn a subset of Python,

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.280
not the entire programming language,

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.760
but it's syntactically valid

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.840
and you have all the right syntax.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.360
But for some kids, it might be easier to get started

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.200
with having not everything,

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.840
like being part of what you have to code yourself.

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.680
- Right, like learning,

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.880
oh, whoops, you forgot to close the parentheses.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.360
So it's not gonna run, or you forgot to close the quote.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.280
So it won't work, something like that.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.160
- Yeah, exactly.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.080
Yeah, kids run into that all the time

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.760
'cause they're like, well, I see the words on the screen

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.600
that I wanted to do,

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.720
but I don't know, you gotta put it in quotes.

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.560
And why?

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.280
- Oh, and maybe regarding the age,

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.480
this is recommended for age 10 plus years.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.440
So yeah, when you want to get started

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.280
with actual textual programming.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.440
So it fits into the third age range that we discussed.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:44.000
- Excellent, okay.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:50.360
And yeah, that's pretty much the last limited age range,

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.400
I guess you would say,

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:55.600
before you just go and do regular programming, right?

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.680
- Exactly, from there, you can just progress

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.480
onto more traditional programming languages.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.200
There are lots of resources,

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.080
like from the Bersperry Pi Foundation,

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.480
they have Python courses, and there's some on Udemy.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.520
If you start looking,

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.320
there are tons of resources to get started.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.400
There are lots of online and on-site classes

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.640
that teach kids starting at various ages.

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.480
Yeah, I know about a few German offers

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.520
where you can really find what you're interested in,

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.920
which is really important,

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:33.920
like make coding fun and learning fun for kids.

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.280
So find out what they are interested in,

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.560
what their passion is,

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:41.080
and then find something that fits their interest.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.320
- Mm-hmm, I'm sure there's a ton of stuff on YouTube

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.880
as well to help people, but at least I'm out of touch.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.720
I bet there's a lot on TikTok, actually.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.680
- Oh yeah, I'm out of touch with that as well.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.760
- Just, you know, you learn one concept every 30 seconds,

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.200
you just swipe away until you're a programmer.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.480
- I should actually look at that, probably,

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.760
when talking about coding with kids.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.200
I guess that's something that would,

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.720
or can play a big part.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.480
- Yeah, yeah, for sure, or Instagram Reels or whatever.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:18.400
All right, I think that kinda touches on

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.880
most of the resources that we have.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.840
There's one more I do wanna talk about, though,

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.000
and I think this probably is good around,

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.520
it's beyond the code combat stage,

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:37.520
where kids can actually use an editor

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.400
to create proper, valid syntax,

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.440
but it's not much beyond that, and that's Anvil.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:48.120
Anvil, @anvil.works, are you familiar with Anvil?

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:48.960
- No.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.880
- So I've had Meredith, the creator of this, online,

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.800
on the show, but what's really interesting is

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.840
it's a way to visually build webpages

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:05.080
that are actual, real webpages that people can actually,

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.280
you know, you publish it, your family

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.200
or your friends could use it.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.240
So if you wanted to build something

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.920
like a Harry Potter type thing,

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.280
and you could have your friends vote on which one,

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.760
which character is their favorite,

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.280
or in why, or whatever, you know,

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.160
like you could build this into a webpage and publish it,

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.160
and with so many of these projects, it's like,

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.960
okay, I built this cool thing, how do I share it?

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:31.640
Or how do I make it look like the thing that I use?

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.880
You know, and so you can do this drag and drop,

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.000
build it out thing, but then you write the,

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.960
the front end interactive code in Python,

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.920
in true Python, not JavaScript,

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.040
and then it has kind of like a simplified database

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.400
in the backend, so it has like a little bit

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:53.480
of like persistence and storage, but it's really cool.

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.200
After we did Code Combat with my daughter,

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:59.280
we went and we did this, and she built a bunch of things

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.280
that were like really, she really thought were pretty neat.

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.960
She could share with people and, you know,

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.800
have people input little text messages or whatever.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.040
- I love that, yeah.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:12.520
I would, again, I know very, like,

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.560
I have very little knowledge about web programming,

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:19.480
so this would be a good tool for me to get started as well.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.440
- Yeah, well, also the problem is,

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.240
even if you're a very good web programmer,

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:28.800
it's like, okay, kid, you go from Code Combat 2,

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.240
now you're doing CSS, HTML, database,

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.600
you know, like the explosion of complexity that puts,

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.280
and then you do all that, and then how do you even put it

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.520
on the web, it's just so out of control,

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.840
that step from one to the next, and so if people want

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.680
to do anything with like webpages and Python,

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.160
this is a really cool option, I think, right here.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.600
- Pretty cool, yeah.

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.920
And like speaking from your experience,

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.160
how did you get your kids excited about coding?

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:00.120
Did they just like it, or do they hate it?

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.600
- They were, that's a good question.

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:08.600
So my older daughters, they grew up with less technology

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:14.200
'cause they're older, so at first,

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.840
they weren't super into it, but then they got into college

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.120
and they had to start learning things for their degree,

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.400
and so now one of my daughters is doing a lot with R,

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.520
which is fine 'cause she's in psychology,

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.960
and that's what all of her colleagues are using, so.

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.480
- Which is fine, it's not ideal, but it's fine.

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:34.840
- It's not ideal, it's fine, no.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.800
I'm not that, no, I'm very proud of her.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.400
So I think that's, I think there's different things

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.760
that can motivate you, you know, you can just be curious.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.920
Like my youngest daughter's like, let's play games,

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.040
let's play code combat, then she's like,

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.760
I want to build something for my friend, you know,

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.400
and so we did this thing with Anvil,

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.160
and she was very motivated to like seek out the technology

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.840
and play with it, whereas my older daughters,

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.360
I think they weren't that interested,

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.800
and they had other things to do,

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:05.000
but once they got somewhere with a job

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.200
or with their education where they needed it,

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.880
then all of a sudden it was more interesting.

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.240
So, you know, it varies by kid, I think.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.680
- Yeah, absolutely, and I guess that's fine as well.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.800
Not everyone needs to like coding,

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.120
but just having the opportunity to learn about it

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.440
and experience yourself,

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.400
if it's something that you actually like.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.840
I was just so blown away when I experienced

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.520
how fun it is to learn how to code.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.800
I always thought it was boring

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.040
and yeah, having all these stereotypes in my head,

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:40.040
because I never actually knew anyone that was coding.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.960
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.240
- Yeah, it's nice that they had the opportunity

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.560
to learn about it at home.

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.840
- Yeah, it absolutely is.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.360
So I think we have a little more follow-up here

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.760
on the TikTok learning style.

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.960
@tikfastfather says, "You can learn every single short,

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.760
"but you won't remember anything as you flip through them."

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.120
Flip, flip, flip, which is probably true.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.080
And then also, Christian asks,

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.800
"Do you think Scratch is good to start with for kids?"

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:14.760
Like if you had a kid who was 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.560
what would you start them with?

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.800
- Yeah, I would get started with visual programming.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.240
I think it makes it easier.

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.040
I know that for some kids it can be hard then

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.080
to progress onto textual programming,

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.040
but I guess this is just a general thing.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.440
You need to see what works.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.880
It's not that you, it might be that you start with one thing

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.120
and you see, actually it doesn't work for us,

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.240
and then you have to switch tracks.

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.960
And that will happen a lot, and that's just fine.

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.280
You need to find your own path through it.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.280
And don't be afraid to actually make changes

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.280
if you are not enjoying what,

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.240
or your kid is not enjoying their work.

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.400
But I think visual programming is a great and fun way

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:57.280
to get started with coding concepts

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:01.080
and not have it feel like you're actually coding.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.360
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:07.360
So Christiane's child is 13.

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.080
I would look, I would consider code combat, actually.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.880
I think, you know, 13, you're well enough

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:17.880
to do textual stuff if it's not too much drudgery, right?

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.960
Like matching braces and quotes and all that.

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.520
So maybe if this kind of thing inspires,

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.520
maybe that as well.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.440
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.800
I think 13 is great for getting started

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.480
with textual programming as well.

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.120
And what's so nice about having large language models now

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.520
is that lots of these offers are being translated

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:46.120
to various languages, and it is becoming much more easy

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.080
to get started in your native language,

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.480
which might not be English,

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.800
and then you do not have to learn a language

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.600
while you learn how to code.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.200
Yeah, that's also, I think,

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.440
a huge advantage of the current time.

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.720
- Yeah, that's something that's always been interesting

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:07.200
to me is so many of the programming languages are in English,

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:10.680
but many of the programmers,

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:14.320
their first language is not English.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.560
And you know, maybe, like your English is perfect, I'm sure.

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.800
You know, for a while, it's no big deal.

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.360
But when you're 10 years old,

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.440
here you need to learn a program.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.280
Well, by the way, it's in a foreign language.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.880
That's just, that's pretty wild, right?

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.840
- Yeah, absolutely. - That's gotta be challenging.

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:32.760
What was yours?

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.600
How do you feel about this?

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.640
I mean, you're more in it than I am.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.960
- Yeah, I would always start,

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.480
like if you have the chance,

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.520
then start in the native language of the child,

00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.680
and you will definitely find good ways to get started

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.520
and good offers.

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.840
For example, Scratch, I think,

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.440
is available in lots of languages.

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.040
70 languages, actually.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:57.040
So yeah, choose something that keeps the cognitive effort

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:02.040
that you need to get started with simpler,

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:05.440
because otherwise you really have to learn two things

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.000
at the same time, learning a language

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.360
and learning all these concepts,

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:11.640
and it can then be overwhelming.

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:16.000
- Yeah, it's not something that I had to deal with,

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.560
but looking back, I'm like, wow,

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:20.200
I was pretty lucky that I didn't have to learn

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.920
what all the keywords meant in addition

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.360
to just what I was trying to do.

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.440
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.520
That's also actually why I decided to study in English,

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:31.800
because I knew all the papers I'm reading are in English,

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.480
all the code I'm writing is in English.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.680
It doesn't make sense to study it in German.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.960
It's just weird.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.360
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:42.720
It's, the internet has done some interesting things

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:45.920
to just sort of spread everything around globally.

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.040
So, all right, Elena, this has been awesome.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.280
A bunch of concrete things for people to take

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.800
and work with their kids,

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.000
maybe if they're grandparents, their grandchildren,

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.600
or if they're teachers or friends, kids or whatever, right?

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:04.080
How about some, yeah, how about some final advice

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.800
to close out the topic?

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.680
- Yeah, I think for me, two things are the most important.

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.400
One's namely, first, don't force your child

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.800
to learn how to code,

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:17.800
but see if you can find a way that makes it fun for them.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.160
I think making or learning that learning

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.920
is actually a cool thing,

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.400
is like, it offers you,

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.400
or it opens you so many doors in your life

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.840
that you learn that putting in the effort,

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:38.040
and even if something is complicated, is worth it.

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.480
It's just one of the most valuable skills

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:43.960
you can provide your child with.

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.880
So, yeah, learning how to learn

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.320
and how to love learning, I guess.

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:52.720
And there's lots of ways in which you can do it.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.440
Choose the right topics, be patient,

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.320
sit down with your kids and learn together.

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:01.080
Don't force them to sit down for long times

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:06.080
and like rather distribute learning sessions over time.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.760
Don't be afraid to switch tracks.

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.040
I think lots of the things that apply to adults

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.920
also apply to children regarding learning.

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:17.080
- Absolutely.

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:17.920
Very good advice.

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:22.000
I would just maybe re-emphasize

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.800
that people should reward persistence.

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.640
- Yeah. - Right?

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.120
Reward it very, very highly.

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.080
Like, I can't believe you spent half an hour

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.240
and you just barely got it to print hello,

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.960
but that's actually a massive accomplishment.

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:37.040
And like, I'm so proud of how hard you focused

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:37.880
and worked on it, right?

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:39.320
That's a big deal. - Exactly, yeah.

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:44.320
Yeah, that's like, it makes a huge difference to kids.

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.600
- Yeah, probably adults as well.

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.840
And also- - Yeah, yeah, everyone.

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.320
But you lay the foundation for learning, right?

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.640
So, thank you. - Absolutely.

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:54.480
- Yeah.

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:58.240
- Yeah, I mean, that expands onto being good at literature

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.680
or being good at philosophy or like whatever it is

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.480
that's hard to learn. - And just believing

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.760
that you can learn anything.

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:05.760
- Yes, exactly.

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.080
And the other is to try to capture inspiration.

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.320
If they're like really, really excited

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.000
and they really wanna learn a thing at that moment,

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.560
then you could introduce some of these tools.

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:16.440
But if they're like,

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.800
I wanna go outside and play with my friends.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.200
You're like, no, come in here, we're doing coding.

00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.440
Like, maybe that's not the moment, yeah?

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.200
- Exactly, yeah.

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:25.160
- All right.

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.320
Thank you for taking the time to put this all together

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.080
and coming on the show and nice to have you back, so.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:30.920
- Yeah, thank you.

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.160
- Yeah, thanks, bye.

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.000
- Bye.
