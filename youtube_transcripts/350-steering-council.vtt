00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Barry, Thomas, Carol, Brett, and Pablo, welcome all of you to Talk Python to Me.


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thanks, Michael.


00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Thanks, Michael.


00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hey, thanks.


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.040
It's so good to have you on the show.


00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.960
Some of you brand new, some of you familiar faces, but nice to have you all together.


00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.760
You're all on the Python steering council.


00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.600
It takes a lot of people to replace Guido.


00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.600
Is that what I'm hearing?


00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.600
Absolutely.


00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Not even replaced.


00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.000
Not even replaced, just parody.


00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.080
Yeah, exactly.


00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.680
There you go.


00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.280
Fantastic.


00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.500
Well, I'm really looking forward to talking to you all about it,


00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.360
shine a little bit of a light on what the steering council does,


00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.040
what you don't do, what your challenges are, and the role, and so on.


00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.640
But before we do, maybe we can just go around the video version here


00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.760
and have you all introduce yourselves.


00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.600
Start at 12 o'clock, Barry.


00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.280
You've been on the show before with Paul Overt talking about Python 1984.


00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.720
Was it '94?


00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.


00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.840
PyCon nine, the workshop at NIST in 1994. Yeah.


00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.560
That was the first time I got a chance to meet Guido.


00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400
Right on. Yeah. So a quick, quick background though,


00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.760
for people didn't listen to that episode.


00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.360
Yeah. So I've been, you know,


00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.040
working in Python since '94.


00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:33.360
been on the steering council since the initial term I guess. I currently work


00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.520
for LinkedIn and I guess that's all I really need to say. Yeah what kind of


00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.600
stuff are you doing on LinkedIn? We're doing, I do work with the Python team


00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.640
over over at LinkedIn. Currently I'm working on an interesting project that's


00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.680
trying to improve the access to technical documentation to our


00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.320
developers, which is a kind of a fun project at times. Yeah, I bet it is. That


00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.320
sounds awesome. Yeah, cool. Thomas, welcome. Thank you. I'm from


00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.920
Amsterdam in the Netherlands. I've worked on Python since I think 2000. I became a


00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.360
core developer in 2001, so I've been around for quite a while. Ned Batchelder,


00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.880
who wrote coverage likes to call me the most famous Python


00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.480
person you've never heard of because of the things


00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.840
that I implemented in Python that everyone uses


00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.920
that nobody realizes I implemented.


00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.280
But I'm happy being somewhat anonymous.


00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.920
I work at Google on Python itself,


00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.720
on how we deploy Python internally.


00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.000
And I have a lot of fun with very complex technical


00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.920
solutions that grows Pablo out.


00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.560
And I'm also on the board of directors


00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.240
of the Python Software Foundation,


00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.840
which is a little bit of different work


00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.640
than the Python Steering Council.


00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.840
And right now I'm also stepping in for Eva,


00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.840
who left us, decided to move on last week.


00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.900
So I'm currently the interim general manager


00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.720
while we're looking for the new executive director.


00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.340
- So you have basically four jobs.


00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.640
You're a busy person.


00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.040
- Yes.


00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.160
My dad made a lot of fun of me last week when I told him this.


00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.120
He has two full-time jobs and he said I do more work than he does.


00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.000
Sounds like you're busy.


00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.960
Being from Amsterdam, are you happy the F1 championship is now?


00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.760
I heard fireworks yesterday but I wasn't actually paying attention because I haven't watched


00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.840
the Formula One for many, many years.


00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.520
Right on. Well, it's another thing to celebrate over there.


00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.800
Carol, welcome.


00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.360
Thanks, Michael. It's always a pleasure to see you.


00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.440
Yes, you as well. Happy to have you.


00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.240
Much better circumstances. I think the last time I was on,


00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.280
Brett and I were here right after Guido had resigned.


00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.080
Yeah, to basically explain,


00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.480
what was that to discuss the possibilities that were being considered for what has


00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.480
become the steering council? Absolutely. So we're in a great place now, I think. I've


00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.400
been at the steering council since the start, and this was my last term. Right now I'm not


00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.560
running for re-election. I feel really strongly, much like I did with the Python Software Foundation,


00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.640
that turnover is good. And so I am right now in the midst of working as a VP of learning


00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.360
for a startup called Notable.


00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.020
And based on the work that I've done


00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.780
in the Jupyter ecosystem and with Open Science.


00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.240
And so we're creating a collaborative data platform


00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.580
which helps everyone in teams work well together.


00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.840
- That sounds really fun.


00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.680
Awesome. - Yeah.


00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.800
- So you don't have any worry about re-election.


00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.560
You can just vote however you want.


00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.280
You're unencumbered.


00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.120
- I'm unencumbered and it's a great slate of people.


00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.400
So I'm really, really pleased at how things have evolved


00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.400
over time and obviously these fine folks


00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.880
would be wonderful to be reelected,


00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.800
but there's also a great group of folks


00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.580
on the slate as well.


00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.800
So I think we're in good shape.


00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.480
- Yeah, fantastic.


00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480
Brett, welcome back.


00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.680
- Thank you very much.


00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.280
Background, so I'm calling from Vancouver


00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.680
on the unceded traditional lands of the Musqueam,


00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.920
Squamish, and Sale of Truth First Nations.


00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.020
Very upfront on that.


00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.680
I have been on the steering council since it started.


00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.800
And as for a day job, I'm constantly trying to convince


00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.880
Michael to try out VS Code for Python as the soft,


00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.720
as the--


00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.160
- The default way.


00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.520
- For the Python extension of VS.


00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.580
- Yeah, no, good work.


00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.580
I mean, I've not seen a tool take off with such broad support.


00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.580
You know, I always ask the question at the end of the show, like,


00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.580
"What do you use to write Python these days?"


00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.580
And nothing has a second derivative as high as VS Code.


00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.580
Like, the rate of acceleration or adoption is really quite something.


00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.580
So, you should be proud of that. It's awesome.


00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.580
Oh, yes. I'm very proud of the team. They've done a great job.


00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.580
Yeah, and you also now live on an island, right?


00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.940
Right, didn't those storms like separate all the roads


00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.860
from the rest of Canada?


00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.320
- Yeah, for those who-- - You guys doing all right?


00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.940
- Yeah, I'm fine.


00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.900
For those of you who don't know,


00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.900
we had a river of storms, literally,


00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.260
that came through the greater Metro Vancouver area


00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.180
and flooded out every single road in the greater area


00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.220
such that there was literally no land link


00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.860
to the rest of Canada through Canadian land.


00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.640
You either had to fly out


00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.080
or you had to go down through the States,


00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.080
which also was flooded out near us


00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.080
on the Pacific Northwest.


00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.200
So it's a thing, no rail lines either.


00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.360
The ports completely backed up


00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.080
and we're like the third largest in North America


00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.920
here in Vancouver.


00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.160
So like I went to the grocery store yesterday,


00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.400
our, the shelves were pretty bare.


00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.280
Just logistical issues.


00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.960
It's, I mean, I'm in Vancouver, I'm fine.


00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.620
It was mainly out, the poor folks in the Fraser Valley


00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.600
completely flooded out.


00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.240
Like we have no clue what it's going to do


00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.320
like half of all the dairy and all the chickens for the province come through there.


00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.520
There's been a lot of, unfortunately, a lot of animals that drowned.


00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.520
It's really bad.


00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.520
But we'll get through it.


00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.520
Unfortunately.


00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.520
>>Victor: I'm glad you're OK.


00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.520
That was quite a thing.


00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.520
>>Chance: Yeah.


00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.520
>>Victor: Pablo.


00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.520
>>Chance: Hopefully on a higher note.


00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.520
>>Victor: Hopefully.


00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.520
Welcome.


00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.520
>>Pablo Galindo.


00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.520
I've been on the steering council for only this year.


00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.720
So this was the first time serving.


00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.920
I'm living in the exotic land of London.


00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.640
And I work at Bloomer,


00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.160
which is kind of a financial slash news company


00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.480
in the Python infrastructure team.


00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.520
So we do a very similar thing as Thomas team do,


00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.040
but slightly different, I would say,


00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.840
because we need to support all these,


00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.760
not as exciting old systems


00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.680
that banks like to use and whatnot.


00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.280
But we also do a lot of very cool tools,


00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.080
like debuggers and profilers


00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.360
that we plan to open source soonish.


00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.760
And we also make sure that Python experience


00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.280
at the company is the better we can.


00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.760
So we are in the best kind of department


00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.980
after the seventh reorg or something.


00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.680
So now we are supposed to take care of


00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.760
that people are happy and whatnot.


00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.560
Yeah, and people use a lot of VS Code apparently as well.


00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.640
- I bet they do.


00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.640
Fantastic.


00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.880
I was just recommending the running MicroWSGI


00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.880
production article from the Bloomberg Tech Engineering.


00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.880
Oh right, right. That's Peter Sparrow, I think.


00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.880
Yeah, just last week or something. That's a really, really neat stuff you guys are doing there.


00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:11.880
Right, right. And yeah, I think the only, in CPython I mainly work on the parser and the garbage collector these days.


00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:17.500
I've been working as well recently on improving error messages all around and


00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:23.520
kind of user experience. Yeah, there's been a lot of


00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.700
improvement on the error messages and tracebacks and things like that, right?


00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.300
People have been more excited than you would expect to hear you


00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.660
describe that. People are like, "This is so exciting, I can't wait to start using


00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.220
this feature." Yeah, we finished the new parser and it's like, "Well, we can do


00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.140
with this that it's not only like more syntax because like, you know, like people are like,


00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.580
"Oh, now we have like all this syntax, right? Like that's not good." So I said, "Okay, let's


00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:53.340
make something good so people don't demoralize the parser." So, you know, like they say, "Oh,


00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.860
well, the messages are good, so let's leave the parser alone, right?"


00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.940
- Exactly. Yeah, well, nice. - You're also the release manager, Pablo.


00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.540
- Right, right. Sorry. Thanks, thanks. - It's a small thing.


00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.540
- Thanks, buddy, yeah.


00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.000
Yeah, and also the release manager for Python 3.10


00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.080
and 3.11, which is going to be released this year,


00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.160
late this year.


00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.400
And yeah, apparently it's been a very cool release.


00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.560
- Yeah, I've not noticed any problems


00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.080
and it just rolled out nice and smooth.


00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.960
- Yeah, that's a good sign because it's not that


00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.560
there hasn't been any problems.


00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.840
But only on the release side.


00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.960
Once it's released, it's good and well, right?


00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.400
- Yeah.


00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.880
I mean, I'm also able to do because I have a good team of release managers,


00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.640
all release managers helping me.


00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.080
So thanks to all of them.


00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.600
Yeah, fantastic.


00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.040
Well, let's just get started with some definitions.


00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.640
Maybe, Carol, you could also just tell us a little bit of history


00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.040
since you were on the show as well.


00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.760
Like, what is the steering council and then, you know, where did it come from?


00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.640
Right?


00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.120
This is a relatively new thing for Python.


00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.200
It is a relatively new thing.


00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.840
When Guido retired, he left it in the hands of the core developers to come up with a new


00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.320
governance for the language.


00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:17.160
And so I'm really proud of the core development team for coming up with several different


00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.860
options for how to organize.


00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.720
And then we voted as a group after we discussed it all.


00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.240
And the steering council model was the one that won out.


00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.280
It's five individuals from the Python community,


00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.380
not necessarily core developers, but could be beyond,


00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:40.320
who are basically entrusted with, by consensus,


00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.320
building the direction and the future for Python,


00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.880
both the language as well as the core development community.


00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.020
And I think so far it's worked out really well,


00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:02.000
through three terms, you know, I think we've faced a number of different issues


00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.760
and we've done our best to include many different voices and do our best to steward


00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.760
the whole entire ecosystem.


00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.560
Well, I would say you all have done a great job because I haven't heard anything very much.


00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.600
You know, it's in the sense that Python is still being released, features are still being


00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.680
added to the language, maintenance is still being done, and there wasn't a big disruption


00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:35.520
when Guido left. And there was a lot of uncertainty because, as you said, he said, "All right,


00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.840
I need a break. I'm stepping back. I've been doing this for 30 years. That's a long time."


00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:46.880
But he didn't want to impose a structure as the person with no skin in the game.


00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:56.480
Yeah, I think the entire Python ecosystem, yourself and others, for really rallying around


00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:04.320
and trying to make everything work. And I can't underestimate Eva's and the Python Software


00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:10.640
Foundation's impact on that as well for their support. So I'm glad you haven't heard anything.


00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:16.320
I can't say we've seen the same, but... Well, when you're in the eye of the hurricane,


00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.560
It feels different. Yeah, or the middle of the hurricane rather.


00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:27.520
Anyone else want to add anything to that? Just sort of the historical bits before we get into mechanics.


00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.560
I think I want to be fair to Guido.


00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.540
He said I'm going to give the core developers a chance to self-organize


00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.400
before I decide on


00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.280
a successor or something.


00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.200
So it wasn't really him saying you guys figure it out. It was


00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.880
I think core developers need to figure out what they want.


00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.440
And he still is a core developer, and he was on the first steering council as well.


00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:00.280
So there was a very deliberate transition of influence, I will say, instead of power.


00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.720
But if the core developers hadn't figured something out,


00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.040
then I'm pretty sure he would have decided for us.


00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.120
And I think people probably would have been happy with that at that point.


00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.800
But I am really glad that we got a working and very effective


00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.360
steering council instead.


00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.240
I think the thing I'll add is that over the years,


00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.800
there was a lot that was sort of under specified in the steering


00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.920
council spec.


00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.760
And every year, we sort of figure out


00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.560
what the right business is, how often we're going to meet,


00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.440
what kinds of agenda we're going to take on.


00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.880
So that's been really great.


00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.040
It's been great to work with everybody here


00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.380
and everybody in the community to kind of figure out


00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.760
how the steering council is gonna work.


00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.320
And I think we've gotten to a place


00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.960
where it's very effective.


00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.960
- Yeah, and there are other organizations


00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.540
sort of playing in that space.


00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.840
We have the core developers, right?


00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.580
We've got the board of directors,


00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.760
Thomas, you've already mentioned,


00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.640
and then you've got the steering council.


00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.640
So where does the steering council fit in there?


00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.140
What's the responsibility of the steering council?


00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.020
Are you overseeing the core developers?


00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.480
Do you work with them?


00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.620
How does this all fit together?


00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.940
- So I think PEP 13 does a reasonable job explaining this.


00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.200
The idea is that Hito wasn't,


00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.040
he was called the benevolent dictator,


00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.940
but he wasn't really dictating all that much.


00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.380
He was basically the final arbiter,


00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.060
and he let the core dev community make its decisions.


00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:46.220
delegate? Well, I mean he did push his opinion through when he knew he was right and I think


00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:53.420
history has shown that he was right more often than not. But the core developers are the people


00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:59.340
with commit bit rights in the GitHub repo. That's basically it. It's the people who've contributed a


00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:06.380
lot to Python at various bits and pieces or overall. And I think everyone there has earned


00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:13.380
the right to self-organize, so that's what the Steering Council is. But it is still consensus-based.


00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:20.460
The mandate of the Steering Council is to figure out what the core developers want.


00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:27.460
It's not for us to impose our opinion on the core developers, unless there is no other


00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.420
way.


00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:35.020
Some organization or somebody has to decide if it's 40, 60 percent plus and against some


00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.060
idea, somebody's got to go, "We're going to do it or not do it."


00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.580
That used to be Guido, and now it's you all, right?


00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.580
Yes.


00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.220
So, I mean, it's easy when there's a clear answer.


00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.960
It's easy when everyone's clearly in favor or against something.


00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:57.620
It is the 40-60 things, the difficult decisions where we also have to take our time to understand


00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:04.340
the problem and see how it affects people and carefully make that kind of decision.


00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:10.660
And I'll just point out that the PSF board of directors is not specifically involved


00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.020
with the core developers.


00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:20.260
So the PSF is for community work, it's for fundraising, it's for the trademarks, it's


00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.940
the copyright owners, it's also for legal things.


00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:29.260
But the PSF doesn't dictate what direction Python should, the language should be going.


00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.100
It just talks about the community.


00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.900
So it's a completely separate concern there.


00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.380
But we did have the executive director, Eva,


00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.660
sit in on our weekly meetings and help us


00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.100
with administration.


00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.460
And we hired the developer in residence.


00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:49.220
That is to say that the steering council hired the PSF


00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:54.020
employee that is Lukasz, the developer in residence.


00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.580
So there is a lot of interaction as well.


00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.220
But it's mostly the steering council


00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.860
using the Python SoFar foundation, I would say.


00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.060
- Okay, great.


00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.860
Carol, it looked like you were gonna add something.


00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.180
- Yeah, I was just gonna say,


00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.220
in terms of like the 60/40 decisions,


00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.120
there's been very few of those.


00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.120
And part of the reason is when there isn't consensus,


00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.640
what we do is work like, for example,


00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.900
pattern matching was one where we asked the pep


00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.100
to be reworked several times.


00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.740
so that we wound up with a better solution in the end


00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.260
than what we would have if we had just voted


00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.300
yay or nay at the start.


00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.200
So I think that's an important thing to remember.


00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.180
- Yeah, it helps that all of you are


00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.560
on the technical side of things, right?


00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.560
As opposed to overseeing this or whatever, right?


00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.060
It really helps that you can get in there and say,


00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.620
no, no, no, this is gonna have performance implications


00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.540
or just kind of have breaking changes or whatever.


00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.420
- Absolutely.


00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.580
And we come at it from different places too.


00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.580
So that's also an interesting thing


00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.220
that's been, I think, really valuable for us.


00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.260
- Yeah, yeah.


00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.300
Carol, you come at it from the science,


00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.700
the data science and scientific side a little bit more.


00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.740
And Brett comes at it from the editor side.


00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.060
No, I'm just kidding, Brett.


00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.300
(laughing)


00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.220
Yeah, I know.


00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.060
Fantastic.


00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.440
- So when are the elections


00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.200
and then how long do you serve for?


00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.460
- The elections are right now.


00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.860
They close I think on Wednesday, the 15th of December,


00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.700
anywhere on earth.


00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.820
So I, or is it Tuesday, anywhere on earth?


00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.660
It's somewhere around there.


00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.940
- It's Wednesday, somewhere anywhere, yeah.


00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.460
- Yeah.


00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.300
And they've been going for the last two weeks.


00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.180
So the way it works is when the major Python version


00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.680
is released, so 3.10 in this case,


00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.120
that triggers the elections of the new steering council.


00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.820
Since we have releases every year,


00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.260
that means we have a new steering council every year.


00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.540
And we have a single one-year term.


00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.620
So everyone gets reelected or not at the end there.


00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.760
There's a two-week nomination period,


00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.980
and then we have a two-week sort of discussion period,


00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.620
and then a two-week vote period.


00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.180
And so we're nearly at the end of the two-week vote period.


00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:29.020
So by Wednesday, Thursday, we should have a new steering council.


00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:35.020
And as Carol mentioned, Carol's not up for re-election, decided not to go for re-election.


00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.100
The rest of us is.


00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.620
We have no idea if we're in the running or not.


00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.620
I mean, the slate is just really great.


00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.860
So it could be just five new people entirely, which I would be more than happy with.


00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.140
I have more than enough to do as it is.


00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:54.900
Yeah. Do you think it would make sense to have one person stay around as sort of some continuity?


00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.740
Or it probably is going to happen just statistically, right?


00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:06.420
I guess we've talked about it, you know. I mean, that's sort of the nice thing, right?


00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:13.940
It's like we adjust. Things aren't necessarily set in stone. So, for example, when the first


00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.420
steering council was elected, right, when Guido retired, we were actually on an 18-month


00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:23.860
release cycle. So there was a lot more time between elections and now that we're on a yearly release


00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:30.020
cycle, we've decided to keep the steering council elections aligned with Python releases. It seems


00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:37.460
to be working okay and if it doesn't, then we'll have a discussion about that as a community and


00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:45.380
propose changes, but so far so good. Yeah, absolutely. Pablo, and also... Go ahead,


00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:50.660
Thomas? I was just going to say we used to have EVA as sort of the administrative


00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:57.540
memory of the steering council, even though I think there was an overlap of four people


00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:05.140
at every single past election, so it didn't really matter. Even though I am, you know,


00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:10.100
I have taken over some of EVA duties, if I am not re-elected on the steering council, I won't be


00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:17.060
attending as the PSF representative because that just doesn't feel right.


00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:23.380
But it might be that the next executive director does step up and take that position. So we might


00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:31.780
have the PSF executive director as the one person who's been in multiple steering councils and can


00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:37.460
transfer over things. Yeah, and that would give the PSF a seat at the table as well. Well, it's


00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:44.460
It's more about information flowing from the PSF to the steering council than the other direction,


00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.460
because the PSF doesn't really involve itself in the steering council things.


00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.460
But there is the developer-in-residence, there's money, there's sponsorships.


00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.460
There's a sponsorship benefit to PSF sponsors that they get to have a little chat with the steering council,


00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.460
which each steering council has to ratify.


00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.120
It's not a done deal for the next steering council


00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:11.480
But it's just a nice a nice way to have some connection with the people who care a lot about Python


00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.860
Companies that care a lot about Python


00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:22.020
And we also we do have a handover meeting for the next steering council where we'll have both the old steering council members and the


00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.560
New steering council members and make sure that you know discuss any


00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.640
Running issues anything that the new steering council needs to know


00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.280
So it's not even if five new people get elected


00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.280
It's not that we're just throwing them out, you know in the wild and let them figure it out on their own


00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.020
We're still there. We're still part of the community even if we don't get to realize. Yeah, true. You're all still core developers


00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:48.120
They could still reach out to you and and ask help about something. Yeah


00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:53.900
I want to talk about two people really quick while we're sort of touched on both of them Thomas


00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.580
One is just to say thanks to Eva that she's done a lot of work


00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.660
and she's been at it for 10 years or something like that, right?


00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.100
10 years as the


00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:14.140
Secretary or Director of Operations or Executive Director of PSF. She was involved in organizing, or she was organizing PyCon


00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:18.500
before then, so she's involved in PyCon even longer than that.


00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.800
Yeah. Yeah. And for those who are not watching the live stream,


00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.340
But pretty much the whole string canceled, just did a little silent applause.


00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.340
So we all miss her dearly and it's only been a week.


00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.140
Yeah, absolutely.


00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.380
Best of luck to whatever she's off to do next.


00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.380
Also Betsy.


00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.980
Betsy did a lot as well.


00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.980
And thanks.


00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.740
She's also moved on.


00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.380
So yeah, Betsy.


00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:49.980
Betsy was assistant secretary, I think, of the PSF and also organizing sponsorships and


00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.980
all that.


00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.580
It involved a lot of community efforts.


00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.140
- Especially at PyCon, it seemed like she did a lot there.


00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.780
- Yeah.


00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.300
And both of them, so much of what they did


00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:05.900
was behind the scenes, and I can't thank enough


00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.700
their work ethic and how helpful they have been to me


00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.060
and the steering council on so many different levels.


00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.340
So we certainly miss them, but we also wish them


00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.100
the best in their next adventures.


00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.260
- Yeah.


00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.580
All right, with that, serious thanks.


00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.780
I do want to show something I think you all will be amused by.


00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.220
I don't know if you, have you all seen this,


00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.460
this Twitter thread here?


00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.380
(laughs)


00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.220
- Yes.


00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.500
- There was a great mention by Patrick Mason saying,


00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.740
"Hey, the PSF, the @, you know,


00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.560
thus, basically, @PSF on Twitter,


00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.660
is searching for an executive director.


00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.620
Here's the job announcement."


00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.980
Has this been filled yet, this role?


00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.220
- We're still looking for it.


00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:52.780
I mean the process isn't, oh we like someone, we're hiring them.


00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.940
There's a whole search committee and there's resumes to go through and then there's interviews


00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.460
to have.


00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:04.780
We're in the process of interviewing a whole bunch of people via the search company.


00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:11.180
Is it still open for applicants or is it kind of, you have tons and now you're going through


00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.180
them?


00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.180
We have really good candidates, but I think more is always welcome.


00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:21.860
So right up until we decide, especially in December, I think more resumes.


00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.740
Yeah, great. If people want to apply, absolutely.


00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.220
Cool. Okay. I'll put a link in the show notes for that.


00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:33.780
But of course, @PSF is the Pacific Salmon Foundation, and they kindly respond


00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.860
@thePSF is looking for an executive director, @PSF is not currently.


00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.580
Good luck on your search. Sorry for the confusion.


00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.740
and then they responded, "It happens.


00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.260
We're starting to feel like @ThePSFFamily.


00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.100
It's not like @JavaEvercalls.


00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.460
Broken heart."


00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.820
I thought that was a good way to respond to it there.


00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.460
- But yeah, there was a lot of,


00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:01.260
I think Dustin Ingram, one of the PSF board directors


00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.220
and also a Googler, got a follow


00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.340
from the Pacific Salmon Foundation,


00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.060
even though he's never had a follow from the PSF.


00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.220
So I thought that was extra funny.


00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.740
Yeah, that was really funny.


00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.660
Nice and lighthearted.


00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.580
Now, I also want to ask about the developer in Residence


00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:24.580
and how has Lukasz's work helped you all out?


00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:29.140
I mean, I'm sure Pablo, he was the prior release manager


00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.980
and is also dedicated to helping this be smooth.


00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.460
So maybe had an even bigger effect on you.


00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.220
But what's the developer in Residence role interaction


00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.180
with you all?


00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:44.220
Yeah, I think this is one of the things that we are more proud of bootstrapping.


00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.540
It took a lot of time because we had excellent candidates, all of them,


00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.940
and it was not an easy decision.


00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.380
But I think so far also, like, Lucas has made an excellent job.


00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.660
So I think one of the things he was working on a lot


00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.860
is trying to help with the review kind of queue.


00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.260
That's one of the things he's been putting a lot of work.


00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.260
It's extremely difficult because we had a lot of PRs,


00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.580
And I think he has already been on the show before.


00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.820
Yeah, we actually, I interviewed him about,


00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.300
specifically about that role, yeah.


00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.420
Yeah, so I would probably defer listeners


00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.980
to that particular episode.


00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.340
But I think that has a lot of impact,


00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.300
but there has been a lot of other places


00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.820
that maybe are a bit less known


00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.300
when he has been helping a lot.


00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.060
Like for instance, on the releases,


00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.220
like doing Python releases is quite involved,


00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.380
to say it in some good way.


00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:41.880
Is it harder to do a major release like a 3.9 to 3.10?


00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.180
Like 3.10.0, is that harder than 3.10.1?


00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:50.380
Oh yeah, absolutely. There are two moments that are especially bad.


00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:57.380
One of them is the first beta release because what happens is that on the first beta release


00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:03.880
is the point when no new features can be added and technically from that point until the final release


00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.880
It's only bug fixes and things like that.


00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.560
Although people try to stretch the definition of a bug fix quite a lot because there has


00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.800
always been the strategy of like, "I can push maybe this feature like half-baked and


00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800
then call it a bug."


00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.000
And then it's like, "Oh, I'm doing a bug fix."


00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.280
So that's when the role of the release manager is quite important because you need to be


00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.280
human.


00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:33.840
So sometimes people are computing on their free time, so maybe they tell you, "I don't


00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.220
don't really have time for this, but like you know blah blah. So you know there is


00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.000
there is always time for discussions, but but also like you need to be careful


00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.520
with that. And the other problem that happens is actually you know because


00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.360
it's a deadline everybody pushes everything on the last day. It's like


00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:53.760
this incredible amount of activity and some of the you know systems that we


00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.580
have to check everything they take a lot of time to do their checks because


00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.960
they are quite a slow checks that take like three, four, five hours. Right, every


00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.960
unit test for the entire C++ fleet.


00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.960
>> We have a big CI that test us on Windows,


00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.200
macOS, and Linux,


00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.000
but then we have this thing called Build Bots,


00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.040
that basically machines that are donated or that we run,


00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.160
that test us on flavors of these platforms,


00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.120
so different distributions and different versions of macOS,


00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.000
but also it runs heavier checks,


00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.240
like sanitizers, checks for reference leaks.


00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.000
So it's these things that take,


00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.280
If you put that thing on the CIA, everybody would hide it.


00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.920
In the sense that it would be ridiculous.


00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.600
We have these things and they don't run on a single commit,


00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.560
they run on batches, so basically all commits of the day.


00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.040
Then if it fails, you need to do some manual bisection.


00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.560
But anyway, what happens is that because everybody pushes that,


00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.960
and then you need to release at the end of the day,


00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.160
you need to wait for these machines to run,


00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:59.200
and then what happens is that everything is extremely broken.


00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:05.400
So normally up to this point it was kind of, it was a bit weird because like technically


00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:09.000
people are, you know, responsible for things that break or they push broken.


00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.420
But at the end of the day it's kind of like it's the release manager that finds people


00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:16.000
to fix it or I fix it myself a lot of these things.


00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.160
And it's very stressful because you know like people are waiting for your release and it's


00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.800
a quite important release to start testing and you know like the distributors are waiting


00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.520
for you because they have their calendars.


00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.160
And those nights have been extremely stressful, for sure.


00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.960
I mean, and three times has been as well, but like, with the help of Guke, actually,


00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.560
we've been coordinating with this.


00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:44.200
And if not, like, for instance, last time, we've been like fixing between the two of


00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.960
us all these little things.


00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.280
Sometimes you need to revert the thing because, you know, it's like, it's so broken that we


00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.080
don't have the time to like find out what's going on or like too risky to think like,


00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.880
you know, maybe it's fixed, but who knows?


00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:03.240
You know sometimes we just that would be a bummer if your PR failed through CI and you got a wait a year


00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:11.540
Before it was two years before it was two years and you know like people don't get happy when you push them back your feature


00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.200
It was a year and a half


00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:20.520
But I still a squad all time like especially if you miss the line because well


00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.220
Don't put things off until the last day. Come on


00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:29.380
Yeah, people don't understand the thing as well as you would think.


00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.260
Yeah, Thomas, you can say this.


00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.260
Yeah, I was...


00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.620
And then there's the reality of human behavior.


00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.620
Yeah, yeah.


00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.620
I know.


00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.620
You know, like...


00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.620
But it's good advice.


00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.620
People get quite angry.


00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.620
But in a good way.


00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.860
I mean, it's not like, you know, we are all friends here in the Core team.


00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.540
You know, like, it's important to have...


00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.260
I think one of the important parts of being a release manager is that you need to have


00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.860
good communication skills, because it's not only about, like, the technical part.


00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:57.340
also like communicating. I think like Lucas in this case has been also doing a very good job.


00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:01.900
He communicates quite well and especially in tricky situations and I think that that is an


00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:07.180
asset of the position. You need to interact with a lot of different people in the team.


00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.900
People sometimes they say "oh you're paid for this" or "here's all my land release" and you


00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.900
know like you need to also tell them like "no I mean we have these priorities" and whatnot. But yeah


00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:22.060
so this has been an area where he has been helping a lot doing releases. He's still doing releases


00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.380
himself right because three nine dot whatever we're at now still happens


00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:30.780
release manager is kind of a long it's a long service yeah


00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:36.460
um we need to actually find the next release manager for uh


00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:40.620
this is about this is about the time that we try to find you know


00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:47.660
how do you do that barry we have a a small group of of former


00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.420
release managers kind of we throw around some names and then we


00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.420
find somebody to I guess


00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.680
Convince they look for someone to volunteer


00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:03.740
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. We have like a long chain with a big ball at the end


00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:09.020
We gotta try this


00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:15.900
No one will ever approach benjamin peterson's, man that that was a bad deal


00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.900
Yeah, he was the benjamin was the


00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.780
Yeah, yeah.


00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:29.020
Yeah, he did not sign up for 10 years of bug-fixed releases.


00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:33.180
It's also like people I think underestimate the work of releasing an operative system,


00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:39.420
like a programming language. Yeah, I cannot imagine releasing a Linux kernel version, but like


00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:44.940
it's a multi-hour process, quite a lot, and you know like there is always when people say, "Oh,


00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:49.580
can you automate this thing with GitHub Actions?" and it's like, "Oh, come on, I mean,


00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:55.660
Good luck. We have already a huge amount of automation, but there is a lot of processes that are manual.


00:34:55.660 --> 00:35:02.540
It's ridiculous. Or there are so many ways it can fail and you need manual intervention.


00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:08.620
I mean, I have something already that for minor releases, like alpha releases and whatnot,


00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:13.500
which are a bit like, you don't need to build documentation and whatnot, it's almost automatic,


00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.380
even waiting for humans to do things.


00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:21.020
But for big ones like betas and final releases,


00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.140
it's five hours of using it now.


00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.540
Yeah. There's a lot of problems that happen on the go,


00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.940
so it's impossible to do it.


00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.980
>> Pablo has also live-streamed all this.


00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.740
So if you really want to see all the effort that goes into it,


00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.220
you can including watching him.


00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.140
If you go back, watch where he breaks GitHub.


00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.100
So there's a lot that goes on in those releases.


00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:48.100
Yeah, that's right. I think I saw you guys all sitting down and live streaming on YouTube.


00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:53.100
It was just Pablo and Lukasz and the other release managers.


00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:59.100
Not the steering council. Just to make sure. The rest of the steering council stays away from all that.


00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:03.100
We know too well.


00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:11.740
I did want to bring it a little bit back to Lukasz's work and the developer in residence


00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:21.220
position because it was funded for one year so far by Google because of some money that


00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:25.700
was lying around and they wanted a good place to donate it.


00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.500
Eva sold it to them or Dustin sold it to them, I'm not sure what happened there.


00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.740
I wasn't actually involved myself,


00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.940
but it is something that we need to fundraise for


00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.620
in the future to continue it or maybe expand it.


00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.400
We've already talked amongst ourselves saying


00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.420
we would love to have three developers in residence


00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.100
instead of just the one.


00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.460
We've had some really good candidates when we hired Lukasz.


00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.840
Other candidates, I don't know if they'd be in the running,


00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.220
but there's clearly enough interest.


00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.740
There's clearly enough work as well.


00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:03.100
Lucas has been focusing a little bit on selling the position as well because he was very aware


00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:09.740
from the start that for it to continue we need more funding. So he's been trying to make the


00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:15.100
case with his work, make the case that this is a good thing to have and something that people


00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:21.980
should invest money in, which is why we have the weekly developer in residence reports that he does


00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.820
for instance, to showcase the work and all that.


00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.260
Yeah, he's very much out in the open about that, right?


00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:34.060
He does his sort of weekly blog and summary of almost the report you would give to a manager,


00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:38.140
but his managers are the community, and so it just publishes it, right?


00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:42.380
Well, in a very real sense, that is the case.


00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:47.540
It's not a manager who prioritizes the work, because that's us, sort of.


00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.080
He does it on his own mostly, but we're there.


00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:56.960
But it is the people he is accountable to, the way he feels it, and I think we all feel


00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.320
it that way.


00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:04.260
It's the community work, and he's supposed to be doing the things that need to be done,


00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.140
but that you can't really demand of volunteers that they do.


00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.360
So I think that's working out fairly well.


00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.400
Yeah, and it's also the context switching, right?


00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:19.640
Every one of you has something you've got to work on for your day job, and then to come


00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:27.000
back and work on a PR or a bug or triage something or help somebody get CPython to compile on


00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.840
their machine so they can contribute.


00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:35.080
All of those things are better done if you just stay in the flow of going through the


00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.080
issues and going through stuff.


00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.320
He can do that full time, right?


00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.320
Yes.


00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:46.520
He has the full time to spend on all of those things, so he's still context switching a


00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.520
lot.


00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.200
But he can spend a couple of hours.


00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.760
The context is more tightly grouped.


00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.760
Yeah.


00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:57.400
Yeah, and I think it gives the language a continuity


00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.200
and a sustainability of not every--


00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.320
people are going to have to onboard and offboard.


00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.240
We've seen that very much within the pandemic.


00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.160
And it kind of gives us a baseline


00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.800
that things are running as it should be.


00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.760
And also, he's made a lot of automation improvements


00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:23.000
as well. So, you know, there's an incremental, like, let's make it better each year.


00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.960
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.


00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:31.600
How involved or if at all were you with the steering council and getting a move to GitHub?


00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.680
To like the repo or the issues?


00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.360
Yeah, the repo, not the issues.


00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.120
I know the issues are still coming, right?


00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.040
They're not there yet, are they?


00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.320
Yeah. Yeah.


00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.640
Working on that.


00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:48.080
Yeah, but the initial get the code over there, get the--


00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.120
I think the steering council didn't exist.


00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.960
Yeah, I was trying to think about the time.


00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.560
It just preceded that, didn't it?


00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.320
Yeah.


00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.920
I mean, Brett actually was very involved into that.


00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.840
[INAUDIBLE]


00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.920
I think-- yeah, Brett's been involved


00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:06.280
in every change to our version control system


00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.080
probably since the CBS days.


00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.640
I was going to make a joke about CBS.


00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.140
Come on.


00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:11.640
Yeah.


00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.140
Yes.


00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.080
[LAUGHTER]


00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:18.040
I don't think, I was involved with CVS to Subversion,


00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:22.360
but everything subsequently I've somehow been involved with.


00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.400
- Yeah, yeah, so how, are you happy to see it


00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.400
on GitHub now, Brett?


00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.760
- Since I'm the one that made that happen, yes.


00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.920
(laughing)


00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.440
- Well, I mean, you could regret it.


00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.800
- No. - I would think so.


00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.200
No, it seems like it's gone well.


00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.920
- Yeah, it's worked out pretty well, I think.


00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.760
There were some bumps way back, like for instance,


00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.800
I wasn't expecting quite so many core devs


00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.800
who don't contribute to any other open source


00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.160
except Python and thus they didn't know GitHub


00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.000
and they didn't know it at all.


00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.600
- Yeah, you completely changed their workflow, right?


00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.200
- Yeah, so it was one of these things,


00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.120
it was a learning experience for some people


00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.720
and we just had to help them along.


00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.720
There's a whole doc I think,


00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.920
might still be there in the DevGuard


00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.240
of how to get from material users and all that.


00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.480
So it's definitely been great


00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.520
- And I'm really appreciative that one of the things


00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.400
we've been able to do this year, the steering council,


00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.940
is we're very close to moving our issue tracker


00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.740
over to GitHub as well, so there'll be a bit more


00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.620
of a connection between the PRs and the issues,


00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.220
and we don't have to maintain our own infrastructure


00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.300
anymore, which has always been somewhat of a burden.


00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.340
Poor E's been having to keep bugs.python.org


00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.300
running this whole time, when he's got everything else


00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.100
on his plate, he always has to keep up and running.


00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.620
So, yeah, but I mean, Marietta, for instance,


00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.540
deserves a lot of the credit for pushing this,


00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.140
because she wrote the original PEP,


00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.780
and it's always been poking people like,


00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.980
"Hey, can we still do this?


00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.940
'Cause it's still happening, what's going on?"


00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:48.520
And thanks to the PSF for getting the money together


00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.900
through GitHub's donations to make sure that this happens


00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.860
and coordinating all that money and all that hiring.


00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.980
So we're able to have at CIOs of Core Dev work on this.


00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.460
And we've been kind of project managing it


00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.380
towards the end on this to get it over the finish line,


00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.980
but it's looking good.


00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.820
And the goal now is hopefully January sometime


00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.060
we'll be flipping the switch and moving over.


00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.460
- Yeah, that's coming up quick.


00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.300
- Yep.


00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.120
- Yeah.


00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.980
- I think that's sort of like, you know,


00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:19.260
an under appreciated perhaps contribution to Python, right?


00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.220
It's like Mariana has done an amazing amount of work


00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.860
and Brett's done a lot of this as well


00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.260
is to make those kind of like GitHub workflows


00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.340
really natural and easy to use.


00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.580
So, you know, there's lots of people


00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.180
who contribute to Python in ways


00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.140
that are maybe not quite as obvious


00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.500
as what the steering council does,


00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.100
but are just as important, if not more important,


00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.020
for making the whole experience of developing Python


00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.420
really smooth and easy to do.


00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.540
- Yeah, I think also kind of nowadays,


00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.140
there is, I mean, more and more people


00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.100
are conscious of this, but I think there is also


00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.860
like a special emphasis on like,


00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.540
when you contribute this code, right?


00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.300
Like, and then even like people feel that,


00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.340
or they have been like doing documentation contributions


00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.140
or even like CI contributions or whatever, right?


00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:12.420
they say like, "Oh, I didn't continue to see Python." I mean, come on. Like, in the sense


00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:16.940
that I think, you know, it's important for us to highlight this and, you know, there


00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:20.660
is a lot of, even core developers, there is a lot of core developers that don't continue


00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.740
to code, like even just, you know, try dragging and all those things that those are as important


00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:31.060
or even more. Like, you know, code is not a small part, but it's also by far not the


00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:36.260
full picture, right? Like, even if you take Gukka's work, right? Like, he's not coding


00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.980
not much as the developer in Resin.


00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.820
I mean, he does some coding, right?


00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.940
And that, you see the impact that he's having, right?


00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.260
Like literally, we are searching for someone


00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.020
who does that kind of work because it's needed.


00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.540
No, we are not searching for an excellent coder, right?


00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.540
Like, we already have a lot of those.


00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.100
So, you know, like, I think it's important to highlight,


00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.740
and I would like to take the time to say here


00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:01.540
that when people think about contributing,


00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.780
you know, you don't need to think about code.


00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:10.580
You don't have to master pointers to pointers, you know, there's a lot of ways to contribute.


00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:14.460
And you know, there is a lot of people that go and it's always the same thing.


00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:19.300
I'm spending a lot of time mentoring new core developers, like the last four core developers


00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.180
were people that I helped mentoring, myself partially.


00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.220
And you know, it always happens.


00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:28.660
I mean, I've been also very lucky and like the last core developers that I've been mentoring


00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.180
has been extremely smart people and super competent, so it's not been a problem.


00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:36.100
from the people that are starting to contribute for the first time, it's always the first


00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:40.540
question is like, how do I find issues that I can work on, right?


00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.900
Or PRs, which is the most difficult thing to solve because it's not only like, what


00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:50.700
do you like and what are your skills or interests, but it's also like, CPython is a fairly mature


00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.980
codebase, it's not that easy as like, oh, there is this thing, I pick it up.


00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.700
But the key here is that a lot of people don't think about the fact that you don't need to


00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:03.020
think out like because they think bugs like what is the bug or what is the feature you know like


00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:08.300
that I cannot a lot of the time what happens is that the easier parts are actually for even for


00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.980
them right I mean maybe there is a programmer that really likes coding and you know it's very


00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:16.060
easy to say it's like work on this or do you like packaging work on that but like a lot of people


00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:21.740
actually you know are very passionate precisely about other things and they come from a point


00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:26.140
that core developers don't have like for instance documentation we are quite bad at writing


00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.320
documentation not because we don't have the skills that we do is because we are


00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.800
already we are thinking like all developers so we are like okay yeah I


00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:37.120
think I know how to I know the system so I'm documenting this as I think you know


00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.680
and for someone who is hard to see with new eyes yeah yeah or like from the user


00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.480
perspective like maybe we put a lot of detail that is not important and you


00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:50.280
know makes the difficult or maybe we are missing some things that we think as


00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.400
implementation detail but there's other is not so you know that is quite


00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:58.520
important and I'm happy to see that more and more people are working on these kind of things and


00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:03.560
those contributions are super important. Maybe that's where you can have a huge amount of impact


00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:10.680
right, like instead of fixing bugs. I mean fixing bugs is also important but I think my first PR in


00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:18.440
CPython was in documentation. I'm super proud of it. Actually Marietta was the person who merged it


00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:26.120
interesting data. So I think it's important to mention that and more and more people now


00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:31.640
are helping with things like CI because they are super knowledgeable about GitHub


00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:36.040
actions and they say "Oh actually this is very inefficient, maybe you can do this and blah blah blah"


00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:42.520
Maybe you can have in the PRs comments from the compiler warnings, that's


00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:47.160
something that someone could use and that is fantastic. How many bugs are going to be


00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:51.360
be solved just because you know like for us for even for Lucas and myself like


00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.360
helps a lot because we don't need to when we see the warnings we don't need


00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.080
to fix it ourselves because like is there I said so those those changes are


00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.680
actually more long-lasting or even the yeah and that's the kind of thing that's


00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.280
a little orthogonal to the main CPython code that you can go and say I'm gonna


00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:11.880
just try to make the error message more descriptive and that's right less likely


00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.420
to cause some sort of butterfly effect.


00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:19.460
Like, well, I changed the speed of the C eval C loop,


00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:21.540
and that has all these knock-on effects, right?


00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.520
Like, no, there's just-- we put in more details


00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.220
into the string as part of the error.


00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.900
That's way more doable, right?


00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.260
That kind of stuff as well.


00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.900
>>And I would-- yeah, and that's the last thing I want to say.


00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.300
A good example as well is, if you think about it,


00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.820
is the last-- the better errors thing.


00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.060
I mean, there is a lot of technical stuff there.


00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.660
but one thing that happened is that now a lot of contributors are actually contributing


00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.660
the errors themselves.


00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:49.860
I mean, there's some part of the government, but it's not focused on code or fixing or


00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:50.860
adding infrastructure.


00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:57.420
It's because they like to have better errors and they are very passionate about it.


00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:02.820
And that is fantastic because it's also a different area when you can have a...


00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.620
You were saying that apparently people are super happy about that.


00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.660
I've been contributing in very core parts of the Python.


00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.900
I would never thought that this was something that is going to be.


00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:12.860
>> You wouldn't think.


00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:13.460
>> So much of it.


00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:16.300
>> But if you are in the training business,


00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.060
like if you are going and doing


00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.820
an in-person event or a workshop and the students are stuck,


00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.900
and now they have a message that gives them more info,


00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:28.300
that helps a lot of things go more smoothly.


00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.580
So, Brett, I'll throw this question at you first here.


00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:37.380
What are some of the big during the tenure of this group so this year basically?


00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:40.060
What were some of the big or?


00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:44.420
Hard things that you had to decide upon oh


00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:48.220
Wow all right hard


00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:55.820
Well honestly if we're gonna be honest anything conduct related is always hard


00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.940
Stuff comes up and as the final deciders as it were,


00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.260
or the great deciders for the core team,


00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.700
sometimes contact stuff comes up and we--


00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:07.540
- Out in the audience,


00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:11.460
PyLang refers to you all as the dream team, so.


00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:14.500
- Thanks for that.


00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.640
But yeah, contact is always the hardest.


00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.440
We don't like it, no one likes it, it's tough.


00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:23.720
We're very lucky that the PSF contact working group


00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.560
backs us.


00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.740
disclaimer, I'm on it as well, but I also recuse myself


00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:33.320
whenever Python core stuff comes up.


00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.920
But we're really gonna have them to help us give guidance


00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.660
because that's what the kind of work group's there for,


00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.500
is actually to provide guidance


00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.260
that actually can't enforce anything.


00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.080
But we lean on them to kind of act as independent arbiters


00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.360
of everything 'cause for a lot of us, we've been here,


00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.880
I mean, we've been on this team long enough


00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.400
that we pretty much know everybody, right?


00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.140
And a lot of us are friends, it's hard to be impartial.


00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.300
There's a lot of history as well, people.


00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.940
So we lean on the Conduct Workgroup


00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.660
to help act as the independent body that


00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.100
doesn't have all that baggage, as it were, with people.


00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.580
But then it comes back to us, and we


00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.460
have to make a final decision of what


00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.700
are we going to do about this.


00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.340
And that's hard every time.


00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.300
It's not fun.


00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.300
It's stressful as heck.


00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.820
If it's ever reached that point, it's not great.


00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:20.700
Yeah, I would put those in the quadrant of hard and not fun.


00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.900
There are other ones that are in sort of a hard but fun


00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:30.100
kind of quadrant where, you know, some of the technical peps and things like that, pattern


00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:36.160
matching was probably one of the most recent ones where you really have to think through


00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:42.260
some difficult technical problems, but that's kind of the fun part of doing this, right?


00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:46.940
Like we enjoy that, even though it's hard, it's still a fun part of the job.


00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:51.380
So hopefully there'll be more of those and fewer of the fun


00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.180
and not, or not fun and hard.


00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.420
- Yes.


00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:57.500
- Yeah, probably the closest I can think of


00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.660
off the top of my head was deciding for 3.10


00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:04.300
not to make from Dunder Future important.


00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.340
- Yeah, that was quite important.


00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.580
- That was a really tough one because--


00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.580
- That was a lot of stuff happening in the community.


00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.460
People, certain framework authors are like,


00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.840
you're gonna break our framework


00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.980
'cause we depend upon this and whatnot, right?


00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.680
- Right, yeah, I mean it was one of these things


00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.500
where that PEP was written and accepted, I think,


00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.580
like two months after Pydantic was even created.


00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.300
- Yeah, yeah, Pydantic and FastAPI


00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.380
were two of the most popular--


00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.060
- Exactly, and stuff has just changed


00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.780
since that PEP got accepted way back when.


00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.700
I think even that was, I don't think that was even,


00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.620
steering council doesn't think that was a Guido decision.


00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:36.580
- No, no, no.


00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:40.220
- It was a Guido, delegated to Lukasz decision.


00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:44.100
- Right, so that was a bit stressful


00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.300
'cause it all happened right before beta, right?


00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.740
And it was a lot of, it was people reach out to people,


00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:53.780
there was a bit of panic in some corners of the community,


00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.100
but we did the best we could to reach out to everyone


00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:58.140
and say like, "No, let's have a discussion,


00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.740
"we can figure this out."


00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.740
And we just discussed it with everyone involved


00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.980
on both sides of the type,


00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.020
all sides of the type of community,


00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.740
both dynamic and static, and just chatted with people.


00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.840
I was like, "Look, we can't rush this,


00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.180
"and it's looking like this decision is gonna feel rushed


00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.660
"based on the feedback we're getting very near beta."


00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.740
So forget it, we're just gonna rip the code out,


00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:18.820
which thank you Pablo for reverting that work


00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.620
'cause that was a messy back revert.


00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.580
- Next time I can dump that on Google.


00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.860
- Exactly, yeah.


00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.940
'Cause this was pre-dev in residence, right?


00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:29.780
- Yeah, yeah.


00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:30.980
- Deal with this.


00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.860
But it was tough.


00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:34.580
But I think everyone involved was happy


00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.820
with the decision that was made in the end.


00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.120
I have no regrets.


00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.020
I don't think anyone else in the string has all those regrets.


00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.580
I think everyone involved feels like


00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:45.060
it was the right decision not to rush that.


00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.620
We still have to make a decision, which is tough.


00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.980
We've asked the community to see if anyone wanted


00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:54.820
to step forward to actually talk with all areas


00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.980
of the typing world to see like the PEP 649,


00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:59.980
which Larry Hastings has proposed as a solution


00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:04.140
to the problem of runtime types and binding


00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.260
and all this, a lot of stuff.


00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:08.180
We've asked the community, can someone step forward


00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.500
and kind of act as almost a champion or a shepherd


00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.620
or an expert to come talk to us to explain,


00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:16.340
like, have we hit all of the potential issues


00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:19.180
with the gender futures import annotations


00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:21.940
or a PEP six variance proposal or something else?


00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:24.960
And honestly, no one stepped forward.


00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.100
So this is actually one of those things


00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.420
where the steering council might actually,


00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:30.180
in 2022, have to come forward and be like,


00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.500
we'll have to champion this ourselves,


00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:32.700
we'll have to do the legwork,


00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.860
and we'll just have to do it, and it'll take time,


00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.860
but that's what we're here for,


00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:38.660
is if we ask the community to do something


00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.060
and no one wants to do it.


00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:43.340
where the backstop to make sure stuff still happens and works.


00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:47.580
>> Yeah, sure. Maybe give people who have been tracking that super closely,


00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:51.800
just a quick summary of what was that feature and why did it cause a problem?


00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.800
>> Yeah. So the FromDunder feature import annotations,


00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.280
what it did was is it made all type annotations strings,


00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:03.180
which for performance reasons and forward reference problems is really handy.


00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.740
Like there's no overhead in import.


00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:05.840
Everything is just a string.


00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.040
It's in the code object.


00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.340
It's nice and fast.


00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.940
And if you need to reference something in the same module


00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.540
before you've actually gotten to define it, right?


00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.700
Like if you have circular references.


00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.420
- Right, a class method that returns its own self.


00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.980
So you would just-- - Yeah, exactly.


00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.220
Or you've got a class, yeah.


00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.100
Or class A has an attribute of class B,


00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:24.540
class B's got reference A,


00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:27.340
and it takes care of all that 'cause it's just strings.


00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.660
There's nothing to really do there.


00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.140
And then the type checkers just handle


00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.220
the circular references, it's not a problem.


00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:38.620
The problem is, is projects like Pydantic,


00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:43.140
which various other projects like Press API depend on,


00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.860
that messes them up because they need to actually convert


00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.980
those strings back to the original objects that they represent.


00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.900
>> Right. Because they want to rich type information out of that.


00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:52.740
They need to see the real type.


00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.980
>> They want the actual object that that type annotation defines.


00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:59.540
When you do list bracket int,


00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.660
they want that actual object that that


00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.980
represents so they can get at that information.


00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:06.700
"Oh, okay, this is typed to a list of ints."


00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.380
Not just, "Oh, it's a string.


00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.060
"I don't know what the heck that is."


00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.740
And there's a function in the standard library


00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:16.740
that you can call in the InSpec typing module, I believe,


00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.740
which is now in the InSpec module,


00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.700
a better version of the InSpec module,


00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.020
that will give you the actual objects.


00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:24.260
But the problem is, is you still have


00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.920
this reference problem and a couple other things,


00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.400
and it's not worked perfectly.


00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:32.000
And that's why the dynamic typing side,


00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.800
the live typing side, as it were,


00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.280
the typing community got really worried


00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.600
when they realized this was about to become


00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.040
the permanent thing, and why we stopped.


00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.640
Now, there is a PEP, PEP 649,


00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:47.560
which tries to use closures instead


00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.600
to kind of capture all the variables and everything,


00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.120
but not execute anything, right?


00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.820
It's very much like a function closure you'd use today,


00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.640
where you had a function and a function,


00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.360
and that inner function refers to something


00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.640
in the outer function.


00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.000
Nothing's actually happened yet,


00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.620
but at least that reference is still there


00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.680
so it knows where to look for stuff.


00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:09.280
The problem is, is we don't know if 649 fixes enough things


00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.000
for that to be the solution we want to go with


00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.640
'cause we don't think we're gonna get another chance


00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.680
to tweak this, right?


00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.120
If we're gonna try to come up with a solution


00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.600
that fixes all the problems that


00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:20.480
from Thunderfuture import annotations fixes,


00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.740
we also have to make sure it fixes


00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:24.680
as many of the other problems that also exist


00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.520
at the same time so that we only do this once


00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.600
because this is potentially messy.


00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.680
And it doesn't have to fix everything,


00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.720
but anything that it doesn't fix


00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.800
probably will never get fixed.


00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.440
So we have to be prepared to live with that.


00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.600
- And be very aware of what those non-fixed situations are.


00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.160
- I think the second aspect is the key.


00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.920
I think it's probably what is making this so difficult


00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.840
that we already have future input


00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.760
and we don't want like three of them


00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.320
or like combination of them or like whatnot.


00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.680
So I think it's important.


00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.520
And this is the most difficult thing for us


00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.240
because like, as a student council,


00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.840
We like reviewing Pepsi is extremely time consuming


00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.880
and whatnot because you need to not only be aware


00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.920
of like the change itself, but also like what,


00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.280
because documents are written by the authors, right?


00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.800
And then you need to, I mean, it's not like


00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.240
that is ill intention or anything,


00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.440
but there is a lot of things that maybe are left out


00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:18.040
or like, so you need to make sense of the void


00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.480
that is behind this thing, right?


00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.120
Or like what is the far reaching effects.


00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.640
And in this case, the problem is that


00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.800
how many other things don't we know


00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.600
that is not going to work because, you know,


00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:32.440
Like now we, like you see, we knew all these use cases


00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.600
days before beta, like what else about all the people


00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.960
that are not contact us.


00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.160
- Yeah.


00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.200
- Right, and one thing I want to say as well is


00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.360
because this is important, like we care about like,


00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.800
you know, the Anticompass API,


00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.480
but we care about everything else, right?


00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.920
It's not, you don't need to be the author of a big framework


00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:50.600
to have the Steam Council attention,


00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.680
and that's quite important.


00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.480
Yeah, I think it's important to remark, right?


00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.360
Because you know, it's important because there's a lot


00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:00.800
people using this use case and therefore it has more weight.


00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.360
That's true just because if we mess up,


00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:05.920
it's going to affect more people than some random library.


00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:09.480
The random library is also important as long as it's


00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:14.560
using the interfaces that we provide in some way.


00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.080
This is important to know because maybe there is a community of people that use


00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:22.120
type annotations for database tables or who knows.


00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.640
Then they didn't follow


00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:28.800
contacting the Steam Council or Python dev or whatever. So you know it's important if you're


00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.120
listening to this and then you're an author of libraries that use type annotations or even a user


00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:39.280
that uses type annotations in non-standard ways, it's very important to reach to us and maybe in


00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.840
the future to this person who's going to lead this effort because we absolutely need to know


00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:49.840
what these peps are not going to fix. So we say as a Steam Council, okay we take the, or the next


00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.760
extinguished, right? We take the informed decision to accept this PEP even if these


00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:57.840
use cases are going to be sacrificed because as Thomas says, we cannot fix everything, right?


00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:03.280
But we must know where we're lifting it up because what we cannot have is now, you know,


00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:08.640
this situation again because we missed blah blah blah. You only get so many re-dos. Carol?


00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:18.000
Right. Yeah, I mean, there's so many different communication levels on this whole thing. I mean,


00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:28.000
As you know, Michael, from doing all your courses, a 30-year-old language that has many


00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:36.840
different use cases, it's hard to sort of one size fits all.


00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:44.320
I think I reached out to Sebastian and Samuel because we had been using FastAPI with great


00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:48.160
success and our engineers really loved it.


00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:57.000
And I think it is something that is re-energizing the whole web-based side of Python.


00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.760
So you don't want to sort of cut that off at its knees.


01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.760
Exactly.


01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.720
It's one of the things taking advantage of so many of the cool new features, the typing,


01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.080
the async and all those things and whatnot.


01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.080
Right.


01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:18.120
But by the same token, it also, as a library writer with JupyterHub and Binder, it's really


01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:26.360
hard to keep up with everything. And, you know, we try to always test ahead, but not everybody


01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:34.680
will and can do that. And then also, you know, what you do is you understand your library


01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:40.360
well, but you don't necessarily understand the Python internals at the same level or the same


01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:50.040
depth. And so I think Lukasz's proactive, you know, reports out as well as Pablo's amazing


01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:56.760
release notes in the last couple of years helps to communicate out what's going on. And this was


01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:06.360
an unfortunate, you know, last minute revert. And, you know, I think the whole community working


01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:14.300
together is really what's needed to be successful over time. And I'm glad we, although it was


01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:19.780
tough in the moment, I'm glad we sort of weathered through that because we've seen growth all


01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.980
around as a result of it.


01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:26.940
Yeah, absolutely. Really quickly, because we're getting short on time, Alvaro out in


01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:35.740
the audience asked, was enum.strenum delay related to breaking Pydantic?


01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:37.500
We can give a really quick answer.


01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.340
No, had nothing to do whatsoever with Pydantic.


01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.540
All right, cool.


01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.820
This is-- Ethan's been working on a bunch of changes


01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:49.940
to the enum module and making the wrapper and stirrer


01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:52.020
of enums make more sense.


01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:52.740
Oh, that's great.


01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:56.780
And there were some changes that we


01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.980
weren't sure if they were going to impact users


01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.300
in a negative way.


01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.220
So we just wanted to make sure that we understood the decision


01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.860
and why it was made.


01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:09.540
So we asked him to revert it for 3.10 and then write a PEP


01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:12.540
to propose the changes, just because of the scale


01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:16.620
and the impact of the changes, propose a PEP for 3.11,


01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:20.300
and we ended up rejecting that PEP.


01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:24.700
So that was just purely based on the change that was made


01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.140
and the rationale for the change.


01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.980
And not any-- we don't know of any actual breakage that


01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.060
would have happened, but it's just not something


01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.340
that we were comfortable with.


01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:36.700
parse the repper and it doesn't work anymore or something.


01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.460
>> Well, logging it and that kind of thing.


01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.300
You never know where those things end up.


01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.620
So yeah.


01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.380
>> Yeah. Brett, it looks like you're going to add one more thing.


01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.220
Then we're getting short on time.


01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.900
Maybe I'll ask you one more question then.


01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.020
>> It was just an aside,


01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.860
but just to show how much of a fan I am.


01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.140
Last week on Python Bytes,


01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:58.180
you and Brian were asking whether 3.10.1 was a security concern or not.


01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.420
I was just going to say, call out Pablo's great release notes.


01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.260
If they don't scream security,


01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.260
It's not a security problem.


01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.100
All right, super.


01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:09.500
Because if I go and check the Apple release notes for some OS updates,


01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.260
it's like, oh, it contains this little thing and other possible security.


01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.260
Like, you know, sometimes you don't know.


01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.780
No, we are very thorough with those notes.


01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:22.780
And when we release, actually, it's possible that we release extra versions


01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.340
when there is something very important.


01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.740
I think 9 has actually a bunch of those.


01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:31.820
For the time being, I have not been forced to do any of this.


01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:35.300
but sometimes there is CVs and whatnot.


01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.500
We are very into that.


01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:41.740
So yeah, unless we say it's kind of--


01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.900
Well, I just want to thank everyone


01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:45.700
in the entire Python community for not


01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:52.420
writing a sub-language instead of logging for Python.


01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.500
It's funny because the logging module was definitely


01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.140
inspired by the Java logging module.


01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.460
Yeah, you can tell by the names.


01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:05.460
VNA didn't decide to include that particular load of class.


01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.460
Remote pickles or whatever the equivalent would be.


01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.460
Right, right.


01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:14.460
Fantastic. All right. Let's close out our conversation here, which has been great,


01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:22.460
with maybe the challenges or the opportunities, whichever side of the glass fullness you want to take,


01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:24.460
for the Python community that you all see.


01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:28.700
see like what do you see as like a big opportunity or maybe as a big thing we


01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:33.740
need to be aware of and try to work to avoid. Barry go with you first I guess


01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:39.460
since you're at the top of the video. Oh I'm gonna steal probably the thunder I guess I


01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:45.060
think the two really interesting things that are happening in Python land these


01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:49.780
days are the faster CPython work that Guido and his team is working on over at


01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:54.420
Microsoft and I think the other really interesting thing is Sam


01:04:54.420 --> 01:05:00.860
Gross's no-gil work. From a technical standpoint I think you know we can we


01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.940
have a lot of smart people in the community we can work through the


01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:06.580
technical parts of it I think the really interesting thing will be the sort of


01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:10.420
the social aspects and how we make all that work and get people comfortable


01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:13.960
with those changes. It's easy to make everything faster, better, stronger but if


01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.620
there's compromises all of a sudden it becomes a challenge. Yeah Thomas, you want to go next?


01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:24.700
Well, I'm just going to say finding a new executive director for the Python Software


01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:31.940
Foundation is right up there for me because that may have significant impact on the long-term


01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:36.060
goals of the PSF and the direction of the community and all that.


01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:40.980
Even though the PSF is very much driven by the community, it's still a big deal.


01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.060
However, I do realize most of the community probably doesn't care and it's all happening


01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:46.060
behind the scenes.


01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:50.560
So I'm just going to say the Sam Gross thing is the thing that I think is the great opportunity.


01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.780
It's going to take years to land an interpreter that doesn't have a gill,


01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:56.880
and it's going to break a bunch of things.


01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:03.020
And we just need to be very deliberate and shever that correctly and make sure


01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:08.860
that there's a migration path for users and as little impact as we can manage.


01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:10.340
>> Yeah, absolutely.


01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:10.940
That's a good one.


01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:11.840
Carol?


01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:20.780
Yeah, I mean, I think I see a really, really bright future for Python for a couple reasons.


01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:27.820
One, our community has always embraced education and continual learning, and I think that is part


01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:34.940
of having a vibrant language after 30 years. Yeah. And I see... The kids coming out of school


01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:39.900
are excited they still get to use this, not, "Oh no, do I have to learn this now?" Right?


01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:48.220
Exactly. And then from a standpoint of being a truly global language where you're seeing innovation


01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:56.540
in Africa, Asia, South America, you know, all over the world. And I think that's exciting.


01:06:56.540 --> 01:07:03.260
You know, I'm excited to see what comes next. And I have full confidence the next year in council


01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:07.100
will help guide us in the right direction. Yeah, fantastic. Brett.


01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:15.900
Yeah, this is a tough one. I feel like I've been around too long. I'm just curious to see how the


01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:21.580
community continues to be the community that it is in the face of whatever this pandemic throws at


01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:28.060
us in 2022, which is hopefully nothing, but we all know that that may not be. Yeah, we've gone a while


01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:33.900
PyCon-less. Yeah, well, and even if this year is a little tricky for, like, as someone from Canada,


01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:38.700
right, like, traveling down to the States is not quite as simple. So even if PyCon US is more


01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.580
or US folk because it's easier for them to travel


01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:43.700
and some of us international folk can't make it this year.


01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:46.260
It's at least good that we're at least seemingly


01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.820
going that direction, but I mean,


01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.940
kudos to the community for keeping things going


01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.780
and continue to make this community feel welcoming


01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:54.700
and open even if it's been fully virtual for everything.


01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:55.620
- Yeah, absolutely.


01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:58.080
- My hope is we'll just be able to continue to find ways


01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.820
for the community to do that for itself


01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:02.680
and continue to feel welcoming and open and inviting


01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:06.860
regardless of the situation and yeah, whatever that brings.


01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.380
- Yeah.


01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.660
We'll pull through it, we will.


01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.940
Pablo?


01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.580
- I think, I mean, I say a lot of the things


01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.460
that have been said, but I think my,


01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.340
I think what the biggest challenges


01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.740
that we are going to face as a community,


01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.180
as a language, is that we are,


01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.140
like we have so many big groups of users


01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:26.100
that are using the language that have,


01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.260
you know, are very passionate,


01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.500
they have different priorities that now,


01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.740
it was not true before, but now it's especially not true.


01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.540
It's not possible to make everyone happy,


01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:36.220
and decisions that make some people happy


01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:37.820
are directly hurting others.


01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:42.700
We have seen this expressed a lot, like, you know, educators don't like big new things


01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.100
because, you know, it makes more difficult, language is bigger and whatnot.


01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:49.300
Well, you know, enterprise Python, let's quote that a lot.


01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:54.260
But like, you know, they are pushing for features that make more sense in other scale, although


01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:55.260
not exclusive.


01:08:55.260 --> 01:09:00.100
So I think it's quite hard because now it's not a matter anymore of like deciding where


01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:04.260
the actual good decision is and like, you know, digging for it and picking it and, you


01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.940
know, ah, this was a good decision.


01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:06.940
Not anymore, right?


01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:12.380
you need to take decisions that are going to affect a group positively and another group


01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:18.300
negatively and that is a quite important position to be into right and it's hard to know because


01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:23.900
the community is so diverse in terms of technical and application of the code and stuff yeah


01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:29.420
exactly and in action is some possibility in some cases and maybe we need to be more you know


01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:33.580
more more conservative but in some others it's impossible because you know the language needs


01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:39.580
to evolve, like the guild work that was mentioned, we cannot say, I mean we could say yeah we are


01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.940
not going to do it because you know it's going to break a lot and you know everyone is going to be


01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:48.460
the C extensions and whatever, I mean language needs to evolve right, like even grammar and you


01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:55.580
know implementations and you know community wise and you know it's very hard, it's very hard and


01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:59.660
it's impossible to make everyone happy, like it's not difficult, it's important and I think that's


01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:05.260
the biggest as a community I will hope that you know more than we make everyone happy we understand


01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:10.940
each other and you know we don't we come to a place when when there is some good vibes about


01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:14.780
this this problem I think that's going to be the biggest challenge you're giving how big our use


01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:20.380
base is. Yeah that is that is important. All right everyone we are definitely out of time thank you


01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:25.420
for taking all that's really quickly finish it up with just one of the final questions and we'll


01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:29.260
Just super quick, what editor do you use, Barry?


01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:31.140
- Emacs, still.


01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.180
- Thomas?


01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:33.300
- Joe.


01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.140
- Joe.


01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:34.960
- Which no one will have heard of.


01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.800
- I've not heard of.


01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.660
My brother's name is Joe,


01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:37.820
but I'm sure he doesn't help you with that.


01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.140
- I know Joe.


01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:42.780
- Joe is Joe's own editor, and it's from the '80s.


01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:45.020
And it has WordStar key bindings,


01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.980
if you know what WordStar is, which is why I use it.


01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:49.220
- Right on.


01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:50.060
Carol?


01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:54.460
- I have to say, truthfully, Vim, VS Code, PyCharm.


01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:58.940
Right. The gamut. Brett, I could predict yours, but go ahead and let us know.


01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:01.340
Visual Studio Code.


01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.940
Right on. Pablo?


01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:03.440
Vim.


01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:12.700
Okay. Well, I will join Piling in saying thank you for all the work, and it's great to be all


01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:13.900
keeping Python going strong.


01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:16.300
Thank you, Michael.


01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.220
Thank you so much.


01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:19.100
Thanks for being here.


01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.660
Thanks, Michael. Thanks, team. Bye.
