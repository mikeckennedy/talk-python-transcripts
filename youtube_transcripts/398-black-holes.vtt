00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
>> Hey, Sarah.


00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
>> Hello.


00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
>> Hey, welcome.


00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Everyone who happens to be watching live, please put some


00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
thoughts and feedback in the live chat.


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We'll try to make that part of the show.


00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And with that, let's just kick this off.


00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Sarah, welcome to Talk Python To Me.


00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
>> Thank you so much.


00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Thank you for having me.


00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
>> Yeah, I'm very excited to have you on the show.


00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Ever since I saw that first picture of you, I've been


00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
thinking, oh, my gosh, I'm going to be on the show.


00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm going to be on the show.


00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.520
Ever since I saw that first picture of the black hole


00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.720
and heard the news, I didn't know, but I thought,


00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.120
there has to be some Python going on here, huh?


00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.160
- Oh yeah, definitely.


00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.000
We got a lot of traction from our Matplotlib plots


00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.200
that seemed to catch the eye of many developers.


00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.000
- Oh, I see, it is, it is, it is, it is Python.


00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.920
I see, look, there it is.


00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.680
I know that theme.


00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.960
- That's right. - Yeah.


00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.800
Yeah, absolutely.


00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.800
So there's just many fascinating aspects of this.


00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.840
The amount of data, the different data sources,


00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.920
the earth scale telescope that you all created,


00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.800
the processing with the pipeline and Python,


00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.800
and just seeing stuff 55 million light years away at all,


00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.120
which is dark, is kind of crazy.


00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.940
But before we get to all those fun topics,


00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.560
let's just hear your story.


00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.080
How do you get into programming and get to the Python side of these things?


00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.960
And how do you get going in black holes, too?


00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.440
Yeah, so just to introduce myself, hello, everyone.


00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.840
My name is Sarah. I'm currently a member of the Event Horizon Telescope Project,


00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.600
the team that makes images of black holes.


00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.040
I've been interested in astronomy since I was a little kid.


00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.920
Since I was eight years old, I got to in second grade,


00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.360
I got to build a cardboard solar system.


00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.240
I'm sure everybody has kind of had similar experiences.


00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.760
That was really my first kind of introduction


00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.160
into a world outside of our planet.


00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.480
And I was just so fascinated by planets


00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.920
that I kind of binged through all of the astronomy books


00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.140
I could find at my local library


00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.040
and fell in love with astronomy.


00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.040
And so I ended up studying in kind of the physical sciences.


00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.920
I did a bachelor's in physics.


00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.520
And because I was doing a bachelor's in physics,


00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.040
I didn't have astronomy courses as part of my program.


00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.320
So that was something that was pretty disappointing to me


00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.520
because I really wanted to do astronomy,


00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.600
but I couldn't quite do that yet.


00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600
So as an undergrad,


00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.320
I decided to do a summer project in astronomy.


00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.180
So I emailed a professor or a number of professors


00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.800
working in astronomy in the Netherlands.


00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.800
And this professor responded a few minutes later


00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.400
to my email, which I sent during Christmas holidays.


00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.240
So I was very surprised that he'd respond.


00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.840
And it turns out, he said it was unusual for him to get emails from students wanting to do work in the summer.


00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.840
So he said, "Oh, come on by. I'll tell you about my project."


00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.960
And he told me he was one of the big leads of this amazing adventure to take an image of a black hole.


00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.360
And I thought that was the coolest thing I'd ever heard.


00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.720
And I kind of jumped right in and undergrad and then continued my master's and PhD with the project.


00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.520
And I've been here ever since.


00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.720
And so Python, I got introduced to Python in undergrad


00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.460
for programming kind of simple data analysis scripts.


00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.060
Although most of my undergrad was spent on C programming


00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.060
and MATLAB because it was very much on the physics side.


00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.080
And this is mostly what physicists use.


00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.900
But then when I transitioned into an astronomy program


00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.020
my master's and PhD, it was really almost all Python. And so that kind of was a kind of learn


00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.620
by doing kind of training that I had to do. I had to learn how to write. I didn't take any Python


00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:07.020
classes really. Just kind of learn as I go with data processing analysis and then ended up playing


00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.940
a big part in the EHT results. And it really plays a big part in most astronomy data analysis lately.


00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.980
It seems like it's just taken over that world recently, at least for the analysis side, right?


00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.020
Maybe not running on devices, right? There's probably, I don't think there's any Python


00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.900
running on say JWST, but maybe some of the earthbound telescopes have some in play. I don't


00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:40.620
know. Yeah. A lot of the data processing and analysis is done in Python. A lot of visualizations


00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.180
are also done in Python. So it's become a very kind of versatile and flexible tool for us to


00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.460
quickly kind of make figures for papers as many people have noticed in our papers are kind of


00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:03.500
major kind of matplotlib tools that we use and to display our data. Yeah, exactly. I think it's


00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.260
just completely taken over that space, which is really neat. And I think the Python world


00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.380
is much better for having all of these scientists and folks with other backgrounds using it for


00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.580
whatever that they're interested in, right? It's not just, well, here's how Instagram uses it,


00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:27.420
and here's how this other API company uses it, right? There's a much more diverse mosaic of


00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.500
interests and things people want from the language. Absolutely. I think one of the big


00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.140
strengths that we drew from Python was really the open source community. There are many open source


00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:47.420
codes available that we were able to make use of in astronomy that were not necessarily designed for


00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:54.300
astronomy data science purposes, but that just happened to be really useful for what we were


00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.500
trying to do with the data. And so it ended up saving us an enormous amount of time. And so


00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:06.140
whenever we speak about our project, I try to make a big point of saying that we do rely a lot on the


00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:13.020
open source development community, which I think is a part of the developer community that is often


00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.340
overlooked, and that it's really important to support open source work, because a lot of it


00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.340
is done by students and postdocs who are in the sciences, who just happen to need code to do a


00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.700
certain thing and they make it available and it turns out to have many different uses in other


00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.420
people's minds. And so we really build on the shoulders of all these people and it saves so


00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:43.420
much time. Yeah, like Matplotlib or Pandas or a lot of these are absolutely right. Yeah.


00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:51.820
So you gave a really great presentation, a keynote at PyCon 2022, and I'll be sure to


00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.620
to link that and we'll pull some ideas out of there.


00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.640
Before we get to really into the programming and Python


00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.400
side of things, give us maybe just a little bit


00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.220
of history of black holes.


00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.120
A lot of this starts with Einstein, right?


00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.360
And as soon as you see that dip, well,


00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.740
if there's enough gravity here, but what if you put more?


00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.740
And what if you put more?


00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.740
How steep can that curve get until it--


00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.100
and stuff falls into it and it gets steeper, right?


00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.780
Give us the history.


00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.620
- Yeah, actually the history starts,


00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.820
I think in the 1700s, even before Einstein,


00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.360
there was this Reverend, Reverend Mitchell,


00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.060
who thought about this idea of, say,


00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.140
when you have kind of something


00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.780
trying to leave the earth's gravity,


00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.420
it has a specific escape speed


00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.980
in order to leave the earth's gravity.


00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.900
And no matter the size and weight


00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.140
of the object trying to leave,


00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.140
it always has the same escape speed


00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.380
because it depends on the gravity of the earth.


00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.740
So he thought what would happen


00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.740
if you would kind of make the earth so heavy, so compact


00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.940
that the escape speed would become higher


00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.700
than the speed of light.


00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.020
And so he thought, he made this thought experiment


00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.020
and he found out that by having the speed being higher


00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.540
than the speed of light,


00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.340
the star that you collapse ends up being dark


00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.500
because all of the light that is at its surface


00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.660
cannot escape, so you can't see it anymore.


00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.200
If it doesn't get to your eye, you cannot see it.


00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.460
So you end up with a dark star.


00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.180
And that was this kind of thought experiment


00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.660
that led to being a black hole.


00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.900
This dark star is actually a black hole.


00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.460
So even in the 1700s, philosophers, even religious people


00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.500
like Reverend Mitchell thought about these ideas


00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.680
about what it could look like if you had such an object.


00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.540
And these objects often seem,


00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.020
well, this was just a thought experiment.


00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.020
And then when Einstein came along,


00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.580
He tried to describe space and time and gravity


00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.500
in a single unifying theory,


00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.900
ended up the theory of general relativity.


00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.580
And that was in 1915,


00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.700
when he showed that light was actually affected by gravity,


00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.520
so that light would bend around heavy objects


00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.780
because of this bend in the space time.


00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.860
And then a year later,


00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.740
Carl Schwarzschild found the first kind of real solution


00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.880
to Einstein's theory, to Einstein's equations,


00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.380
which ended up in what we call the singularity,


00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.600
which showed that there's this object


00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.420
that is kind of a hole in the space time.


00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.020
And this object has a horizon,


00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.740
which we call the event horizon.


00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.160
And this name, the size of the horizon,


00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.300
the radius is called now the Schwarzschild radius


00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.980
after Karl Schwarzschild.


00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.500
And it showed that anything that goes beyond this horizon


00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.980
can never come back because the escape speed at the horizon


00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.620
is the speed of light.


00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.340
So anything that goes beyond would


00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.100
need to escape speed higher than the speed of light.


00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.860
And light is the fastest thing that goes.


00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.380
So nothing--


00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.780
You're going to circle around and just kind of just--


00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.500
Exactly.


00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.740
Probably still move, but still be trapped within that space.


00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.380
Exactly.


00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.740
So you can never--


00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.340
once you cross that point, you can never come back.


00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.820
And at that time, so people thought a lot


00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.020
about the theory of Einstein and this mathematical object


00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.940
that we call the singularity.


00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.660
And we, at the time they thought,


00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.660
okay, black holes are mathematical objects,


00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.700
but there's no way that could be real, right?


00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.540
So people thought, okay, mathematically,


00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.100
that's so interesting,


00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.860
but these things can't exist in the universe.


00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.300
And then in the 1930s, Chandrasekhar,


00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.900
famous Indian astronomer,


00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.900
he thought about the massive stars.


00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.140
So they're, you know, stars when they die,


00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.540
they become white dwarfs.


00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.460
And so they die in these kind of stellar deaths, dead stars.


00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.460
But then he thought, what about more massive stars?


00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.580
Stars are much heavier.


00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.820
It turns out that he calculated it


00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.480
and white dwarfs have a maximum mass.


00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.540
So there are certain classes of heavier stars


00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.260
that could never end up as white dwarfs


00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.540
because they would collapse to something more massive


00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.700
than a white dwarf.


00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.140
So it cannot be a white dwarf.


00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.260
And it turns out what they collapse into is a black hole.


00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.700
And this is the very first evidence


00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.700
that black holes could exist in reality, in the universe,


00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.020
that they're kind of a inevitable endpoint for heavy stars.


00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.540
Ever since then, people have been thinking


00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.300
about where to find them.


00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.560
People have been detecting these powerful streams of gas


00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.580
coming from centers of galaxies


00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.100
that could only be powered by a black hole.


00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.420
And the galaxy M87,


00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.980
that's 55 million light years away from us,


00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.560
does have one of these big streams.


00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.380
So that was the very first stream of gas


00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.460
from a center of a galaxy ever observed


00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.460
by humanity in 1918.


00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.020
They didn't know that it was gonna be a black hole


00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.540
at the time, but then there was more and more evidence


00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.220
that the only thing that could really power


00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.780
this really powerful process had to be a black hole.


00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.860
So we started then the story of trying to understand


00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.420
what they would look like from an observer point of view.


00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.340
How big does the black hole have to be for us


00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.980
to be able to see it from Earth,


00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.600
how big do we design a telescope that could see it?


00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.180
And it turns out there are only two black holes in the sky


00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.980
that are reachable with the telescope,


00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:16.860
the size of the Earth,


00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.900
that's our maximum size that we could go.


00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.760
And one is this black hole in M87,


00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.760
which we imaged in 2019.


00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.820
And then the second one is our very own black hole


00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.940
in our Milky Way, Sagittarius A*,


00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.660
which we imaged in 2022, just last May.


00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.340
- Oh, do you have pictures published of that?


00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.460
- Yeah, that's right.


00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.100
It came out on May 12th, 2022.


00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.900
Yeah, just two weeks after my PyCon talk.


00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.700
- Oh, what's the timing?


00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.360
- Yeah, it was very frustrating


00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.820
not to be able to say anything.


00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.300
So I kept telling people, you know,


00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.420
"Oh, please watch our news."


00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.100
And you know, we have exciting stuff coming,


00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:53.940
but I couldn't say anything.


00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.420
- We have more pictures.


00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.060
I'm sure you know I've seen them.


00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.060
- Yeah.


00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.520
- It's also worth pointing out this whole project


00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.900
that you were on.


00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.860
It's a long running project.


00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.700
- Yes.


00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.380
- When did it start?


00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.420
I know it.


00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.100
- Yeah, so the kind of the technology part


00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.620
started in the late '90s


00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.340
and then actually starting to add more and more telescopes


00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.220
started in 2007.


00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.940
So it is about a 10 year process


00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.220
between the first telescopes that joined


00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.500
and then the 2017 campaign


00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.700
in which we had finally enough telescopes


00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.820
to take the data to make images.


00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.820
So about 10 years of building and we're still building.


00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.180
We're still adding more telescopes.


00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.820
We've added three more since then.


00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.860
- Yeah, so this is called the Event Horizon Telescope


00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.980
and it's a planet scale telescope.


00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.740
I mean, I just saw a whole bunch of news


00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.740
and cool pictures from JWST, James Webb Space Telescope.


00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.580
- Yeah. - And it's huge,


00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:59.060
but it's only like 30, how many meters across?


00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.940
30 feet, some number of meters, 12 meters, I don't know.


00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.180
It's not planet-sized.


00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.020
- No.


00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.380
- How do you build a planet-sized one?


00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.740
- Yeah, so we use a very clever trick


00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.060
that is called interferometry


00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.220
that actually won the Nobel Prize back in the '70s


00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.340
and by Martin Ryle, who designed this technique.


00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.980
And what we do is, in fact,


00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.780
it would be great to have a telescope


00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.300
the size of the Earth that we could build,


00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.660
like a giant Death Star in space


00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.540
that we could look at that.


00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.920
It would save us so much trouble, honestly.


00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.400
But it turns out convincing funding agencies


00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.020
to give us that kind of money wasn't really possible.


00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.440
So we had to use this clever technique of interferometry.


00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.000
And what we do with our technique is we sync up telescopes


00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.840
that are at strategic locations around the earth.


00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.920
They have to observe at the exact same time


00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.720
and they're timed accurately by atomic clocks


00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720
that are so precise,


00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.360
they lose about a second every million years.


00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.720
And so these clocks time-


00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.560
- They're big too, right?


00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.380
They're like-


00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.820
- They're about the size of a mini fridge, yeah.


00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.660
- Wow, okay.


00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.000
- Yeah, they're big and they're very expensive,


00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.720
so we have to take really good care of them.


00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.460
So there's one at each of our telescopes


00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.740
that time tags the data as it arrives at each site,


00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.840
and then we record that data onto hard drives,


00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.760
and then we ship those hard drives to a central computer


00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.960
in which all of the data from all the telescopes


00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.120
are combined and aligned together


00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.380
to synthesize a virtual telescope the size of the Earth.


00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.880
So that's how we do it.


00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.200
The telescope is not physically the size of the earth,


00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.200
but we synthesize it using telescopes


00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.520
that span the size of the earth.


00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.000
- Right, so kind of like little different sensors


00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.560
at 10, 15 locations. - Yeah, exactly.


00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.900
- But you have to keep them in sync.


00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.000
That's the big problem, right?


00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.420
- Yeah, and timing is everything for what we do, yeah.


00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.440
- Yeah, and you think about how off can you be?


00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.000
You're talking the speed of light,


00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.840
a little, a microsecond, you cover a lot of distance


00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.920
than that time at the speed of light, right?


00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.880
- That's right, yeah.


00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.560
We have to be extremely accurate


00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.080
because any shift in time between signals


00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.400
means that we're no longer in the reference frame


00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.360
of the black hole.


00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.760
Everything that we see has to be in the reference frame


00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.600
of the black hole.


00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.160
So it all has to be exactly aligned at the same time.


00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.160
And there are many, many different aspects


00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.040
in the instrumentation of each telescope


00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.240
that needs to be measured very accurately


00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.280
and corrected at the time of combining the signals.


00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.800
And then we also go through a very lengthy data processing


00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.320
step in which we correct all these additional effects.


00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.560
We also have to deal with the Earth's atmosphere


00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.600
because we observe at such a high frequency in the radio


00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.280
which is 230 gigahertz.


00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.920
We're dealing with very high frequency radio waves


00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.360
and they're very affected by the atmosphere.


00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.400
So water vapor and instability in the atmosphere


00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.160
can scramble and destroy our signal.


00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.200
So we have to correct it after the fact


00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.280
and kind of model the atmosphere at each site,


00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.160
remove it, and then we can average our data down


00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.760
and build signal that way, build signal to noise.


00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.800
And then finally, at the end of that,


00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.200
all that processing is where imaging comes in.


00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.080
And then we can combine the data with our imaging softwares


00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.660
and then reconstruct images that best fit the data.


00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.400
- Yeah, you've had a really cool visualization


00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.280
showing how obviously the earth is curved.


00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.160
I liked how you tried to reinforce that


00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:29.160
- Yeah, I really hope people know that the earth is round.


00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.080
Otherwise it would make our job very weird.


00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.320
Yeah, we definitely have to take into account


00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.360
the curvature of the earth


00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.580
because of this delay in curvature,


00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.360
two telescopes far enough apart


00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.780
have to deal with the earth's curvature


00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.280
because then the signal doesn't arrive


00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.640
at the same time at each place.


00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.440
It arrives down here earlier than it arrives here.


00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.860
And so we have to take into account


00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.400
this curvature difference


00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.360
to make the signals be at the exact same time.


00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.320
And we do that at the supercomputer stage.


00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.280
- Yeah.


00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.160
So let's, maybe let's follow the data for a minute.


00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.800
'Cause I think that that's pretty interesting.


00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.880
So it starts by things hit the different telescopes.


00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.880
How many did you say were involved at the time?


00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.160
- Eight, yeah.


00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.880
Eight telescopes at six different locations.


00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.560
- Yeah, you got these eight different telescopes


00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.880
and they're all at different points on the earth.


00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.520
So the signal's hitting them at different times


00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.200
just because it's not a lot of time difference,


00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.880
but it's enough to make a difference in the light waves


00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.240
or the radio waves.


00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.480
But then the next step gets pretty interesting


00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.960
because it's not like we're using our fiber,


00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.320
our gigabit connection to upload the data.


00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.040
You record it to a huge block of hard drives


00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.440
and you physically send the hard drives, right?


00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.600
- Yes, that's right.


00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.200
Yeah, they're basically just standard kind of helium drives


00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.960
that we use just stacked together,


00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.400
the kinds that are in laptops.


00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.960
And then we record our data onto these hard drives.


00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.240
They're kind of split into random folders


00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.520
with some names that I can't decipher,


00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.920
but people who work at the computer, supercomputers do.


00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.700
And then we pack them up,


00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.980
we drive them down each mountain


00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.460
and then ship them usually via FedEx or UPS


00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.940
to our two central correlation facilities


00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.100
where we combine the data.


00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:27.060
One is at MIT Haystack in Boston right here.


00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.620
And then one is in Bonn, Germany


00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.660
at the Max Planck Institute for Radiostronomy.


00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.700
So they get half the data and they get half the data.


00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:40.780
- Yeah, there's one guy who used to be a police officer


00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.340
who is now in charge of logistics of the data.


00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.540
- That's right.


00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.660
Yeah, I always like telling the story of Don


00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.340
because so Don Souza used to be a police officer


00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.700
for the state of Massachusetts.


00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.460
And then since then, for the last 20 years,


00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.660
he's been dealing with the shipments


00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.820
for MIT Haystack Observatory.


00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.660
And all of the data goes for him,


00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.280
including the ones that go to Bonn.


00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.020
And he's been doing this for years


00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.020
and he is our main shipping guy for the EHT.


00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.340
And he's never lost a single package.


00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.240
- That's incredible.


00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.800
Yeah, there was just one, I think, funny mishap that happened once where we had a package


00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.800
incoming from the South Pole that was meant to be our South Pole equipment.


00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.200
And then he opened it and it was just a bunch of fabric.


00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.840
So that was a little bit of an issue.


00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.640
Yeah, I don't remember if it was silk, but I think it's just regular fabric.


00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.280
But then luckily, with the help of the shipping company, the mishap was found and then the


00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.360
fabric went to the rightful owner.


00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.400
And then the equipment got returned to us.


00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.360
So everything went well.


00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.200
- Yeah.


00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.960
You're like,


00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.120
they didn't get what they expected


00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.840
and we definitely didn't.


00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.680
- That's right.


00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.760
- How bad would it have been if you had lost it?


00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.880
Would it have been catastrophic or would it have been just?


00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.680
- So it wasn't data, it was just a piece of equipment.


00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.280
It would have been expensive to get another one


00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.440
and go through the tests


00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.360
and it would have probably delayed a couple of things


00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.640
but other than that, it would not have been catastrophic.


00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.520
- Yeah.


00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.640
- The other thing I think is interesting, as you said,


00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.960
the color code, the hard drives with green ready to record


00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.360
and empty and red being awful and they got to be processed.


00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.360
- Yeah, we have little round stickers on our modules


00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.960
that have the hard drives, that color code.


00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.960
- Yeah, yeah, I mean, why not, right?


00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.320
You want to look over and see like, oh, that pile,


00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.480
that pile is going out, not coming in.


00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.960
- Exactly, yeah.


00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.920
And often at the sites we have spare modules


00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.760
that we have just in case we have issues


00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.720
recording onto certain ones.


00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.840
So it's good to know which ones we've recorded on


00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.100
and which ones are spare.


00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.820
- Yeah.


00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.740
So there's a lot of data here,


00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.120
which is why you ship the hard drives.


00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.560
Yeah, if you had a couple of gigabytes,


00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.160
nobody wants to ship hard drives, right?


00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.600
They can break, they can get lost.


00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.720
It's relatively slow unless you have petabytes of data.


00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.260
And then all of a sudden you realize


00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.880
this is actually a problem.


00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:13.120
I've been just doing some backups of all the podcast episodes and stuff that I did.


00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:19.480
And they're like 20 gigs per episode and there's hundreds of 700.


00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.920
I've been uploading for days, for four or five days.


00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.000
I'm only through one of the podcasts for part of the time.


00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.680
I'm like, this is insane.


00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.400
And I'm so excited to appreciate just like how hard is it to send this much data?


00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.800
So when you're talking petabytes, and these are remote locations as well for the


00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.960
- Yeah. - Summer is often, right?


00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.160
So maybe not the best connection.


00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.320
- Yeah, I think it would be pretty much unfeasible


00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.200
to send data from our sites,


00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.600
especially the South Pole is our most remote location.


00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.440
And during the South Pole winter,


00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.360
the internet is not very good.


00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.600
So we have to rely on some satellite connections


00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.520
that happen twice a day.


00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.840
And so the connections are about fast enough


00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.080
that it would take about 40 years


00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.000
to get all the data from the South Pole


00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.240
that we take during our campaign.


00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.920
So it's really just not feasible.


00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.340
Our founding director always says


00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.680
that you cannot beat the bandwidth


00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.160
of a 747 filled with hard drives.


00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.840
So shipping is always the best.


00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:23.600
- Yeah, that's incredible, but apparently true.


00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.580
- Yeah.


00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.580
- Yeah.


00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.000
So we have a picture, right?


00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.160
We have this amazing picture of the black hole.


00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.200
We'll talk about the story about how we get it,


00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.400
but maybe just describe it for people.


00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.480
I'm sure everyone listening has seen it,


00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.600
but it's maybe been a couple of years.


00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.680
- Yeah, so this is the picture of the M87 black hole,


00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.520
what we call the first image of a black hole.


00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.360
We released this picture in April, 2019,


00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.580
so three years ago now.


00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:57.560
And this picture comes from our 2017 observing campaign,


00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.680
and it is of the central black hole inside the galaxy M87,


00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.340
which is 55 million light years away from us.


00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.480
So the light you're looking at in this picture


00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.920
is 55 million years old, which is pretty cool.


00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.480
And when it left the black hole,


00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.760
the first mammals were starting to appear on planet Earth.


00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.440
- Wow, amazing.


00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.840
- It's pretty cool, yeah.


00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.040
So what we're seeing in the middle


00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.520
is this kind of dark patch,


00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.360
which we call the black hole shadow.


00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.800
And there's this big ring of light around it.


00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.280
And the dark patch is where the black hole lives inside.


00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.560
And the reason why it's dark


00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.240
is because inside there's the black hole's event horizon,


00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.880
which is actually a little bit smaller than the shadow.


00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.560
And the path of the light rays


00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.560
that are around the event horizon makes the darkness


00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.440
in which the light can no longer escape,


00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.280
it makes it puff up.


00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.160
And so the light rays kind of graze a bigger area,


00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.840
which is why the shadow is actually bigger


00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.320
than the event horizon.


00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.960
And then this ring of light around it


00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.360
is very, very hot gas.


00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.640
So we're talking billions of degrees,


00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.040
a hot gas swirling around in the black holes,


00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.200
either accretion disk or bottom of its famous jet.


00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.200
And this gas is swirling around so much that it's glowing


00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.440
and it emits light in the radio,


00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.000
which are those radio waves that we observe.


00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.960
And so this is light that hasn't crossed the event horizon.


00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.040
It's not close enough to be pulled in into the darkness


00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.840
and not being able to come out,


00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.800
but it's just close enough to show us


00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.040
this shadow of the black hole.


00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.880
It illuminates the darkness.


00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.120
So there's all this mass has been attracted,


00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.960
but it's like whipping around,


00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.560
kind of like a toilet bowl, right?


00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.280
The water is not just shooting through the hole.


00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.200
It's kind of spinning,


00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.760
but it's spinning near the speed of light


00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.580
and there's lots of friction and stuff,


00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.480
which makes it glow, right?


00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.780
- That's right, yeah.


00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.040
- And what about the jet?


00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.360
Does the jet come from this accretion disk


00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.860
or does it somehow come out of the black hole


00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.760
or where is it coming from?


00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.320
- It doesn't come out of the black hole,


00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.880
but it does come pretty close,


00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.600
from pretty close to the black hole.


00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.320
So this image in particular didn't teach us too much


00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.820
about the jet other than we can't see it in our image


00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.720
because at the time we didn't have enough telescopes


00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.420
to see the jet because it's very, very faint


00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.920
at the frequency we're looking at.


00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.680
But our polarization image, which came out in 2021,


00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.420
which showed kind of a more spiral structure on top


00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.600
that trace magnetic fields around the black hole,


00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.200
showed us that the magnetic fields around the black hole


00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.720
are kind of in a spiral shape that twist enough


00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.120
and are ordered enough to be able to launch the jet.


00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.600
So they're coming from the rotation speed


00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.280
of the black hole that makes the kind of the space-time twist


00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.960
and the magnetic fields twist, and that is launching the jet.


00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.720
- Okay, amazing.


00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.840
I was just thinking last night, getting ready for this


00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.600
and doing some of the research,


00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.200
you know, the black hole, the lights and all,


00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.960
light and all that stuff goes into it, all this matter,


00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.240
and it's completely dark, but inside,


00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.320
It must have an insane amount of light and energy somehow in there, right?


00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.000
If you could get into it, it must be really bright.


00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
If none of the light ever created can ever leave, it must just be building up in there.


00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
It's hard to tell.


00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
I don't think you...


00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.120
It would be completely...


00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.760
It would be hard to explain what you would see inside.


00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.480
Because once you fall in, space-time is getting stretched like crazy.


00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:31.000
more in you go the more stretched it gets because it inevitably should end up in the singularity in


00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.480
which all of space and time is compressed into a single point. So everything is kind of shifted and


00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:42.440
spaghettified and so even the light ahead of you, you wouldn't be able to see it because it can never


00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:48.360
travel back in the direction where you are. So wherever you're falling, whatever is in front of


00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:55.000
you, you cannot see because it cannot go out. It can only go in and so but you can look back.


00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.160
there's nothing. Yeah, maybe it's not right. Yeah, if you look back behind you at the horizon


00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:08.200
and at the outside, you would see the entire history of the universe. Yeah, it's kind of a,


00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:13.080
it's a very mind-boggling place and I think people do get very creative about what could


00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.480
happen inside a black hole. What you would see, there are a lot of thought experiments around it,


00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:22.280
but obviously because of the physical boundary that is the event horizon, we can never know what


00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.640
as beyond. I often get this question in talks like, "Oh, what you show us is just the shadow


00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:34.440
of the black hole. It's not the actual black hole itself," which I think is not a true question


00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:39.560
because I don't think this statement is true because this is everything we can see of the


00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:45.720
black hole. It is the black hole in the only way we can see it. Whatever is inside, we can never


00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.920
see. So this is always a picture of a black hole. This is it. This is it. Yeah, this is as far as


00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.720
you can go. You cannot go further in. Mel in the audience says, "Whoa, that is weird."


00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:02.680
It definitely is weird. I think we get a lot of very emotional reactions whenever we talk about


00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:09.080
kind of the whole aspect of looking at this image and what it represents, this end of space and time,


00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:15.720
this kind of point of no return, and this whole kind of world of what is beyond it,


00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:22.520
what is outside of it. Yeah, very strange. All right, so back to following the data along,


00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:29.480
we've got petabytes of data collected to these hard drives on site at these six different


00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:36.760
locations. They get shipped to the two places in Cambridge in the U.S. and in Bonn, Germany.


00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:43.880
And then what happens? Yeah, then once all of the disks arrive, they get plugged into these


00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.600
kind of readout machines that kind of reads out all the data from all the different sites.


00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:54.920
And then we have supercomputers that align the data using a bunch of, it's a very complicated


00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.720
machine, but it takes into account the Earth's curvature, a model of the Earth, the positions of


00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:05.320
the telescopes, different instrumentation effects that we measure at the sites that get put into


00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:12.760
this big model. And then all the signals between each pair of telescopes is aligned precisely


00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:21.320
to maximize the detection. And then once all of them are aligned, what remains, so what we record


00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:26.040
at the site is kind of all of the signal the telescope receives, which includes signal from


00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.440
the black hole, but also the atmosphere, the surroundings, the air, the instrument, and stuff.


00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.400
But because the only thing the telescopes have in common is the black hole signal,


00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:42.200
the rest of the data doesn't, what we call, doesn't correlate. So it is not seen in common.


00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:47.040
So at that point, a lot of the data that's noise,


00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.760
we can get rid of because we only


00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.100
care about what the telescopes see in common, which


00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.040
is what comes from space.


00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.280
And so then we can reduce the data from petabytes


00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:03.360
to the hundreds of gigabytes level, terabyte, gigabyte


00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.320
level.


00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.400
And then at that point, after the correlation,


00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.200
the data are ready to move on to the data calibration stage.


00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.680
So we end up with kind of data files per observing day


00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.040
of about maybe 100 gigabytes, 300 gigabytes,


00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.980
kind of manageable for software.


00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.520
Yeah.


00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.360
And then at that point-


00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.640
- You could transfer it over the internet


00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.160
sort of levels of data.


00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:30.980
- Kind of, yeah.


00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.320
So usually we can put it on a common archive.


00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.040
That's where we have it stored, the correlated data,


00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.960
And then the data teams go in and get the data


00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.360
and then process them through their software.


00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.640
And we use cloud computing facilities


00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.260
to do the data processing as well.


00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.420
It really speeds up things.


00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.920
- These are like big supercomputers in those two locations,


00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.780
not like AWS or Azure, is it?


00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.380
- No, they're at the locations, that's right, yeah.


00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.680
Yeah, they're basically computer clusters.


00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.040
- Okay, are they dedicated,


00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.240
especially for this job or they?


00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.620
- They're dedicated, especially for dealing


00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.340
with radio interferometry data.


00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:19.140
They don't necessarily, they're not used all the time by us.


00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.820
They're also used a lot by geodesy experiments.


00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.260
So geodesy is the science of studying


00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.280
tectonic plates on earth.


00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.780
So they basically do the exact opposite to us.


00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.560
They use telescopes at different locations on earth,


00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.300
looking at a common source that doesn't change.


00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.380
And then in that way, they can track the movement


00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.260
of the locations of the telescopes on earth.


00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.240
And they do these observations many, many times


00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.200
and that's where they get all combined.


00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.860
And in fact, through geodesy,


00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.500
that's how they get the model of the earth


00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.140
that we use in our experiment


00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.700
to correct for this movement of the telescopes.


00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.340
So there's a kind of very nice cycle


00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.100
that happens at the same location.


00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.080
Yeah.


00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.820
- Yeah, that is a symbiotic cycle.


00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.100
That's great.


00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.320
So it's in this calibration stage


00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.700
where Python starts to make its appearance, right?


00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:12.720
- Yeah, so we have our data processing softwares


00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.880
are I think mostly built in, let's see,


00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.960
Fortran and C code,


00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:24.480
so more of the kind of heavier data crunching parts.


00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.680
And then there are a number of kind of post-processing tasks


00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.900
that do use Python,


00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.820
Especially we have a kind of suite of post-processing tasks


00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.400
that make use of pandas a lot,


00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.020
because it offers a very neat data structure


00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.780
that allows us to organize data corrections


00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.940
across kind of different columns of types of data.


00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.540
And that's been very helpful for us.


00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.500
- Yeah, you also get a lot of the matrix multiplication,


00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.700
vector math type of features.


00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.300
- Yeah, a lot of that too.


00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.860
Yeah, it's very helpful.


00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:00.860
And it has made our data processing a lot cleaner


00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.080
to do it through that data structure.


00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:09.820
- Now this cycle where you take the data,


00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.180
you factor out the atmosphere and other interference,


00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.980
and then you add in all the good parts of the signal,


00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.260
the positive parts of the signal


00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.180
from the different telescopes.


00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.460
You analyze it.


00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.460
You said that this cycle goes around a couple of times


00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.060
and takes like a year and a half or something, right?


00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.660
Yeah, so from the time we took the data, which was in April 2017,


00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.760
to the time we released this image in April 2019,


00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.500
about one and a half years of that time was spent on the data processing


00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.820
and this feedback loop between our correlation centers


00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.620
and the data processing team.


00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.520
I was part of the data processing team.


00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.620
We were quite a small team working kind of around the clock


00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.120
on a pretty fast turnaround,


00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.680
is because we had kind of a lot of data issues identified


00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.720
at each site that needed to be run down


00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.520
and then going back upstream and then back down.


00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.120
And we also had a feedback cycle with the imaging teams


00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.360
that looked at early versions of the data


00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.560
and then discovered issues


00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.600
and then again, going back upstream.


00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.800
So there was a long process of really trying to fix


00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.320
all of the instrumentation parts


00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.440
that would contaminate the black hole data.


00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.640
And then eventually we finally had a dataset mature enough


00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.120
that would allow for actual imaging.


00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.560
And then once that was done,


00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.220
where we're dealing with data files


00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.200
in the kind of hundred megabytes sizes.


00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.240
After data processing,


00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.940
we could really average our data down.


00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.940
So we're dealing with complex numbers.


00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:45.840
The data we get from the black hole are complex visibilities.


00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.000
They have an amplitude and a phase.


00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.520
And in the data part--


00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.360
- Seven plus two I, complex in that sense?


00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.600
- Exactly, yes.


00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.360
Yeah. And so because we have complex numbers,


00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.080
if we try to average numbers in which the phase part don't align,


00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.840
we end up destroying our signal because it's destructive interference.


00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.560
So we needed to align the phases in order to average down our signal


00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.760
to have constructive interference and build up signal.


00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.400
And that's really the key part of the data processing.


00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.920
That's what we do in order for the imaging teams to have the best data possible.


00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.480
And then in the kind of 100 megabytes data,


00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.760
Then we move on to our imaging software.


00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.920
- Indeed.


00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.680
A quick question from the audience.


00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.720
What sort of wait times do you experience


00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.120
when you're iterating on,


00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.880
in this step when you're sort of working


00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.480
and say, "Do you put a notebook and you press run?"


00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.840
How long until you see the results?


00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.200
I guess, what's the experience of working like this?


00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.560
Is it a lot of batch processing


00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.240
and you walk away for lunch,


00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.280
or is it small enough that you're getting


00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.040
immediate responses?


00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:57.160
Yeah, so I think outside of the Python packages is where we run most of the big data crunching.


00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:03.120
I think in those parts, it would take a couple of days to run through our calibration pipeline.


00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.440
And then the Python parts would take maybe a couple hours.


00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:13.600
Then when we're running diagnostic Jupyter notebooks, it would take maybe not long,


00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:20.000
because then at that time, we're basically in the 100 megabyte parts, just doing data checks


00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.640
in which we make use a lot of Jupyter notebooks, in fact,


00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:28.080
and Matplotlib to plot through our entire data steps


00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.520
and cross-check every part.


00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.520
We have all these diagnostic notebooks that look at our data.


00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.320
And those don't take much time to generate.


00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.040
I would say maybe 20 minutes would generate


00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.680
kind of a single suite from a Jupyter notebook.


00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.440
Sure. Very interesting.


00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.560
So most of the work is done by this supercomputer


00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:53.680
and seeing Fortran and then you kind of are working with the raw answers in just numerical


00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.000
form but you want them visual later, you want them correlated or things like that.


00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.440
Yeah, then when we're really looking to diagnose our data to find instrumentation errors,


00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:12.720
then visual representations are extremely useful and we've made a lot of use of kind of Jupyter


00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:19.080
notebooks, especially in our data processing checks to make sure everything looks good


00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.200
at each step of the pipeline.


00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.200
All right.


00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.480
One more audience question, then I'll move on.


00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:32.040
Mellie asks, "Do you do logging or any staging to keep track of the stages they're at and


00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.040
not in a loop?"


00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.040
So...


00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.040
Yeah.


00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.040
Yeah.


00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:41.320
So each data pipeline has multiple stages in which we have kind of checkpoints at each


00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:49.080
stage where we have a suite of kind of Jupyter notebooks or our plots, a suite of plots generated


00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:54.040
so that we can go back if there's an issue we can go back at each stage and look at the outputs and


00:38:54.040 --> 00:39:00.760
make sure that we can generate or we can identify where the issue has happened or where the failure


00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:06.600
has occurred. We have logs also of every process that comes in. We also do very strict version


00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.240
control of each kind of software version.


00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:15.080
Every time we run something, we do have a kind of version control package


00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.080
of all the software within one single pipeline run


00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.080
that we keep track of as well.


00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.240
That's really interesting because you want to have reproducibility, right?


00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.600
- And if-- - Absolutely.


00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:31.720
Maybe something minor changed about the way Pandas does floating point operations.


00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.760
I'm just making this up, but, you know, theoretically, over versions


00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.480
and give you a slightly different answer, right?


00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.600
So you want to have a really clear snapshot of the entire system, right?


00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.640
That's right. And this was also very important for us


00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.360
when we released the papers for this image.


00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.520
We also released the versions,


00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.880
version-controlled pipelines,


00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.520
both on the data side and on the imaging side,


00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.800
that contained the exact versions


00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.200
and kind of container form of the software that we used


00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.800
and the scripts that we used to generate these exact results.


00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.160
How awesome. So this won the Nobel Prize, right?


00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.680
It did not.


00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.880
You did not?


00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.020
No.


00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.160
I don't know why I thought I did.


00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:23.760
No, we won the Breakthrough Prize in Physics in 2019. Yeah.


00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.040
It won the heart and the minds though.


00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:34.960
You did point out in your talk about how much this made a splash among people who are not scientists.


00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:42.640
Yeah, that was something that was very shocking for us because when we, building up the project,


00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:47.440
obviously we had talked about the project in various media forums and it was interesting


00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:52.320
in the astronomy community. So we knew there was some traction about the project that people would


00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:57.920
be interested in the results. But we did not expect the magnitude at which this image would


00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:04.800
really go into pop culture, especially the fact that the next day after this release,


00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.520
it was on front pages of newspapers around the world, which is really unusual for science


00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:16.960
results, especially around these times, 2019 was not the most happiest of years news-wise.


00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.160
There was plenty of other stuff to occupy the news.


00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.160
So it was definitely unusual.


00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.920
It ended up trending number one on Twitter,


00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.280
which is really surprising for science news.


00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.200
We did not have a trending campaign really. We didn't prepare a hashtag.


00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.520
It was not something, we were not really social media savvy kind of people.


00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.880
It was not planned, it just kind of organically happened.


00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.320
Then there were so many memes and references and we were


00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.080
referenced on talk shows and documentaries and


00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:54.480
news segments. So it was really beyond anything we had expected and there was a lot of demand also


00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:02.720
to hear from us, not just from astronomy or physics academics but also a lot of demand


00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:09.520
from planetariums and science camps and even museums. We did a bunch of talks at


00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:14.240
museums which was really enjoyable and kind of reached a different audience and that was all


00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.480
really cool. I think really nice experience to kind of reach out to the community and make sure


00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:24.320
that people are part of it because these days science results happen in very big teams and


00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:30.240
not just that our teams are funded by taxpayer dollars. They build on resources from various


00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:36.960
communities including the developer community and programming and instrumentation community and


00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:42.480
all the giants in physics that came before us. So it's really not just kind of a personal victory


00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.000
as a member of our team, it's kind of a global effort.


00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.800
And we want to make sure that we send a signal


00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.800
that teamwork is really a global thing


00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.880
and that big science happens in big teams


00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.240
and that everybody's playing a part in this in some way.


00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:02.320
- Are you familiar with the Mars Rover GitHub?


00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.640
Not the rover itself, but the Mars,


00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.680
the badge, I guess it's called.


00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:08.880
- No, I don't think so.


00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.280
- So people got this, for the people who worked on,


00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.120
Where is this?


00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.180
Oh, somebody show me the badge.


00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.020
So,


00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:22.720
yeah.


00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:27.720
So for people who worked on the Mars Lander,


00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.020
they got a special badge.


00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.600
I don't know where it is.


00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.440
- Oh, really?


00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.280
Oh.


00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.280
- I feel like there should be one of these as well.


00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.520
- That would be cool.


00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.360
- Right?


00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.000
For the people that worked on this project,


00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.440
it should be like a little black hole badge.


00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.280
So I don't have it.


00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.100
- That would be very cool.


00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:43.940
- It's like a little badge,


00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.240
like here's the Arctic contributor one.


00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.080
There's a Mars rover.


00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.820
And so people in GitHub out there,


00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.240
let's make a black hole badge.


00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.780
'Cause there's so many of these open source projects


00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.740
that are indirectly used and contributors to it.


00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.040
And they could have a black hole badge


00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:58.880
and that would be awesome.


00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.800
- That's a great idea.


00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.960
I would be happy to reach out to people


00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.920
and try to see if I can make that happen.


00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.040
I think that would be really awesome.


00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.840
- Yeah, yeah, indeed.


00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:08.680
I don't know.


00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.040
I think, I don't know the username


00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.840
people to search for it. But anyway, I think that would be really cool. I think there should be a


00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:22.240
badge. But let's go and talk Matplotlib for a minute. So here you are presenting this keynote.


00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.680
- Yeah, my favorite.


00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.640
- Yeah, tell us about this picture that you got here and then we can maybe dive into how you know


00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:35.360
the picture that we see is actually the picture. - Yeah, this is my favorite plot ever,


00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:43.200
which is kind of underwhelming when you show it to most people. But people who are radio astronomers


00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:48.160
like me would be extremely excited seeing this. And this is really the first kind of depiction


00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:54.400
of M87 I saw after we finished the data processing pipeline. This is before anyone made any image,


00:44:54.400 --> 00:45:01.200
by the way. It was in May 2018 when we actually finished the very first run of the full pipeline


00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.880
in data calibration. And this was the


00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.160
endpoint, this plot.


00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.880
And what this plot shows is kind of the


00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.560
on the y-axis there's flux


00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.040
density, which is basically the


00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.080
the brightness of signal seen by pairs


00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.000
of telescopes.


00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.240
And then on the x-axis there is baseline


00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.920
length, which tells us kind of the


00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.760
the separation between pairs of


00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.440
telescopes. So telescopes close together


00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.360
see a lot of signal in common.


00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.200
Telescopes far apart see kind of


00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.400
a smaller signal in common.


00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.800
And depending on their location,


00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.280
they probe different sections of the image.


00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.280
And so what we see here is this kind of,


00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.340
how would I say that?


00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:43.280
This kind of bump, double bump in the image.


00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:48.280
And what this double bump actually tells us in the plot


00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.320
is if you look at the dashed line,


00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.840
this is what we would expect


00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.320
if the image on the sky was a uniform ring.


00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.160
Uniform as in the brightness along the ring


00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.220
is the same everywhere.


00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.280
So it's just a closed ring


00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.640
and the brightness is the same everywhere.


00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.040
And so it turned out that this bump structure


00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.200
looked really close to a uniform ring.


00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.720
And this was already really exciting


00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.760
because we were already trying to imagine


00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.280
what does the ring look like?


00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.200
And this plot also tells us how big it is.


00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.760
It tells us it was actually 42 micro seconds wide,


00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.540
of this ring without any image.


00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:26.900
And what was also really cool is that


00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.340
if you look at the first dip location,


00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:32.200
you will see that the data actually split into two levels.


00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.720
There is a lower level and an upper level.


00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.440
And these correspond to two different directions


00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.040
on the sky that the stations are looking at.


00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.880
The lower level are looking at the source


00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.580
in the East-West direction, so across,


00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.760
and they're seeing a kind of dip.


00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.840
And then the other ones are looking at it


00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.880
in the North-South and they're seeing more signal.


00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.520
And what this difference tells us is that


00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.300
the ring is not uniform,


00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:01.880
but it's actually asymmetrical in the North-South.


00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:05.000
There's one part that is brighter,


00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.840
either North or South, that is brighter than the other side.


00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.800
And if you look at our final image,


00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.220
it is brighter on the bottom than it is at the top.


00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.920
Whereas if you were to slice across,


00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.920
you will see it's the same, right?


00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.420
If you were to slice across, it's the same,


00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.120
but if you were to slice like this,


00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.940
you have less signal up here and more signal down here.


00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.380
Already the plot told us so much


00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.300
about what we're looking at.


00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.140
- Yeah, yeah.


00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:28.980
So before you had a picture,


00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.380
you're like, "Oh, we think we're onto something here, right?"


00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.620
- Yes, it was super exciting.


00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.340
But then we were very careful because we thought,


00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:39.580
"Okay, there's a lot we can tell from this plot,


00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.540
but let's not try to get ahead of ourselves."


00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:45.380
Because there are a lot of types of images


00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:49.380
that could be tweaked to mimic this kind of structure.


00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.980
And so that was kind of part of the next stages


00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.580
in which we wanted to split our teams into,


00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:00.560
our big imaging team into four independent teams.


00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.660
And each team worked independently for about seven weeks


00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.840
on analyzing the data in any means they wanted,


00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.780
with any software they wanted, any decision they wanted.


00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.500
And then we came together after seven weeks at a workshop


00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.140
to compare the images.


00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.640
And each team submitted a single image.


00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.340
And it turns out that the images between the four teams


00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.600
were very, very similar to each other.


00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.680
And so that was really exciting.


00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.820
And everybody got a ring of the same size,


00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.500
42 microseconds and brighter on the bottom.


00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.400
Even though there were kind of some small differences


00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.440
across the images that came from the,


00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.280
these user-based choices in the software,


00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.880
still the main structure was there for everyone.


00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.000
And I think that was one of my favorite days


00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.920
in the collaboration because we had so much fun that day.


00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.640
It was such a big relief because we


00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:51.040
were using so many different techniques and imaging software


00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.920
that we weren't sure we would all get the same answer.


00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.720
So we were really relieved that we did.


00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.160
And then at the end of the day, we all went drinking at a bar


00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.040
and it turned out it was karaoke night.


00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.360
So we all sang karaoke together.


00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.800
It was such a lovely day.


00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:13.040
Were there any space-themed songs like "Hello Major Tom"


00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:13.880
or any of these things?


00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.000
- We sang Black Hole Sun.


00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.840
- Oh, there you go.


00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.660
Yeah, that sounds good.


00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.500
Right on.


00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.000
- Yeah.


00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:20.840
That was a must.


00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.200
But we changed the lyrics to Black Hole Shadow.


00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:28.560
- If you're taking petabytes of data


00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.480
and running them through a bunch of algorithms


00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.080
until they come down to megabytes,


00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.160
or you said the final picture is actually


00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.960
like less than one meg.


00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.880
- Yeah.


00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.320
- Then, you know, what you're seeing,


00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.560
is that actually what you're seeing?


00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.400
Or is that artifacts built up along the way?


00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.880
Right. So this must have been really comforting to try these different algorithms and go, they all come up with the same picture.


00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:55.600
Yeah, I think we were confident about what the data were telling us, but we wanted to make sure that we understood how our software were responding to the data.


00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:05.400
So, you know, from kind of objective perspective, when we looked at the data plots, we knew what it was telling us.


00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:11.960
But we wanted to make sure that we looked through every avenue of possible ways of creating images that look similar to the data.


00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:19.000
And in fact, it's really very hard to create images that don't look like what we have.


00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:27.920
And so no matter how much we tweaked our software, we would always end up with something very similar to the final image.


00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:35.240
But we still wanted to put our software through this test and do a kind of process in which we would test it.


00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:43.920
And in the end, the final stage ended up being trying to find what is the best kind of combinations


00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:46.720
of our software choices that gave us the best image.


00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:52.020
Because we generated so many images with user-based choices, and they ended up pretty similar


00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:55.180
to each other with the base structure, but how do you pick one image?


00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:58.720
So that was kind of the dilemma we had at the final.


00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.360
We didn't know how to pick a single image, so we decided to create these kind of fake


00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:09.440
data sets that mimicked our data in which we knew the real truth images and they looked like rings


00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:16.960
or disks or double sources. And then we made our softwares go through thousands of combinations of


00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:23.920
these parameters and kind of tested how well they could reproduce all four of them, all four images.


00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:29.520
And then the ones that were kind of, we ranked them and then number one was the best image for


00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:34.160
each software. And then the final image you know, the famous image of a black hole, is actually just


00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:39.600
the average of the three software images, the three best images from the software. And this is


00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:46.560
also only one image of the black hole. This is only April 11. We observed M87 for four days


00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:53.600
in 2017. So we have four images of this black hole from 2017. And they all look the same, and they


00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:56.680
And they all went through separate day observing,


00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.640
separate processing, and always giving the same answer.


00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.360
So you all are pretty sure that this is the picture.


00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:04.860
Absolutely.


00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.440
At least this is the radio astronomy picture.


00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:12.520
Yeah, this is the picture at 230 gigahertz.


00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.320
Yeah, exactly.


00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.400
There's also pictures of that general space


00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:22.820
with Hubble and some other things that you laid out.


00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:30.260
Yes, this is a really fun part of our campaign also, because obviously we're trying, the purpose


00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:36.020
of our experiment is to learn about black holes. We want, I mean, these objects are super fascinating.


00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:41.300
They're kind of mind-boggling in how they exist and what they do to galactic environments.


00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.940
These jets are enormous and they're pierced through entire galaxies, and yet they come from a very


00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:51.940
tiny part of the galaxy itself. And so in really understanding black holes, it's obviously


00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:57.860
really useful to look at one up close, but we need to combine that knowledge with how it looks across


00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:04.420
all colors, all wavelengths. And so we had a big multi-wavelength campaign at the same time as


00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:10.500
these observations across lots of different instruments. So we had instruments in the high


00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:18.420
energy, in the x-ray, infrared, in optical, and also other radio wavelengths. So we had a lot of


00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:21.300
of partnerships with other observatories, too,


00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.340
to make that happen.


00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.540
And we learned a great deal about the black hole


00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:27.420
and its jet through that process.


00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.380
Yeah.


00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.580
It seems that black holes, supermassive black holes,


00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:34.220
are a fundamental part of galaxies almost, right?


00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:34.980
Absolutely.


00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:37.860
They live in the centers of most galaxies.


00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:41.180
And M87 is one of the special ones


00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.220
because it has this big jet coming out of it.


00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.340
So it's very nice to get a look at one


00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:48.660
that has a jet up close.


00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:52.260
And actually, our Milky Way black hole, Sagittarius A*,


00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:56.100
is one of the very common boring ones.


00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.420
And so the fact that we can have both of them


00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.500
and look at both of them is kind of special


00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:04.220
because it gives us kind of two very different classes


00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:07.140
of black holes that end up looking very much the same.


00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:10.420
Sagittarius A*'s image looks a lot like M87.


00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:12.460
This is really just because, even though they're


00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:14.700
totally different black holes, they differ in mass


00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.060
by a factor of about 1,500.


00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:20.020
And our Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, right?


00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.660
But M87's galaxy is elliptical, and it's


00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.260
much older and much bigger than our Milky Way.


00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:27.900
And M87 has a jet, and Sagittarius A star


00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.300
doesn't seem to have one.


00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.060
So there are two very different black holes.


00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.820
And yet, once you get up close, it's really just--


00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.540
the effects of gravity is so strong


00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.300
that it's really all you see.


00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.140
And it's so cool that they look the same.


00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.140
It is amazing.


00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:43.980
I guess it's worth just pointing out


00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.340
just how large the M87 black hole is.


00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.060
Oh, yes.


00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.900
The shadow of the M87 black hole could fit our entire solar


00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:56.540
system very easily.


00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:01.460
The orbit of Pluto would be about in the mid-range


00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.680
inside the shadow.


00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.540
And Voyager 1, which is the furthest human-made object,


00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.420
would be just at the edge of the shadow right now.


00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:09.900
Yeah.


00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.700
It's very, very big.


00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.860
If it were there, it would get sucked back in.


00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:17.420
But if it were unaffected, it would be at the edge.


00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:18.540
Yes.


00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.040
Yeah.


00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.180
So also 6.5 billion solar masses.


00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.180
That's right.


00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:24.680
Yeah.


00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.100
That's really large.


00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.700
It's actually one of the heaviest black holes


00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.220
in our universe.


00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:41.380
I think the current heaviest is about 10 billion solar masses,


00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.780
maybe a little more.


00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:43.620
So 6 billion is--


00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:44.340
>> So it's not that much larger, yeah.


00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:44.840
>> Yeah.


00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.020
It's one of the pretty larger ones.


00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:48.060
Yeah.


00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:48.560
>> All right.


00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.420
Well, we're getting a little short on time.


00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:55.060
So let me close this out with a bit of a future-looking question.


00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:58.500
And I'll give it to the ikuvu from the audience.


00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:02.900
So what's next for EHT?


00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.180
I'll ask it that way.


00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:08.300
>> So since our 2017 campaign, we've kept observing.


00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:11.500
We observed in 2018 where we added one telescope


00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.100
and increase their bandwidth,


00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.360
where we can have more sensitivity


00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.340
in cooler observations of magnetic fields.


00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.780
We also observed in 2021,


00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.860
which was a kind of mid of COVID observation,


00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.580
which was a very strange one.


00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:28.940
And in 2022, we added two new stations after that.


00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:31.780
So we're now up to 11 with the EHT.


00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.120
And we're trying to expand our array


00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.300
to have more telescopes.


00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.600
So there's currently an effort


00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:42.240
called the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope.


00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.200
So the EHT so far only borrowed telescopes


00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.880
that just happened to be at the right locations


00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:48.820
that were actually built


00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:51.440
for completely different science programs,


00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:54.320
just radio telescopes that were able to observe


00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.000
at the frequency we wanted and at the right place.


00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.960
So we didn't have much of a control


00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.320
over the locations of the telescopes.


00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.120
And so in order to see more of our image,


00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.500
for example, to see the jet in M87,


00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.880
we need a lot more telescopes.


00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.640
So the next generation EHT plans to have more control


00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.040
over where telescopes are gonna be put.


00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.840
So we're planning to get smaller dishes


00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:17.660
because we have the sensitivity now with the current EHT,


00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.700
smaller dishes at the locations where we need them,


00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:24.440
where we have holes in our virtual mirror


00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.920
to recover this structure.


00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.940
And eventually we'd like to observe more often.


00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:32.200
So now we only observe two weeks a year.


00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.640
We want to be able to observe every two weeks


00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:40.680
every month and eventually we could make movies of M87 and also if we have enough telescopes we


00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:45.880
would be able to make movies of Sagittarius A* as well and that will really show us the connection


00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:50.840
between the black hole, the gas swirling around it and its jet and magnetic field. I think we


00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:55.720
could learn so much about black holes through that. It would be so exciting. You could get precise speed of the


00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:03.000
the creation disk and how it evolves. Yeah and that's about a 10-year time scale.


00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.160
And then in the far future, in kind of 20 to 30 years,


00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:09.440
members of our team are currently actively thinking


00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.440
about putting satellites into space


00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:14.560
since we're running out of earth diameter


00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.960
to make bigger telescopes.


00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.240
There's only two ways to make your telescope bigger,


00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.200
either make the separation bigger


00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:24.300
or go to higher frequencies so we have higher resolution.


00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.520
And because of the earth's atmosphere,


00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.680
and the size of the earth, we're limited in both.


00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.280
But by going into space, we'd go above the atmosphere


00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.120
So you can go to higher frequency


00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.120
and you could have larger distances.


00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.640
So by putting satellites into space,


00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:41.160
we could have enough resolution to maybe see up to 10


00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:44.960
or even 50 more shadows of black holes,


00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.920
which would be really cool.


00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.960
And then we'd have amazing sharp images


00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.640
of the two that we know and love


00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.320
to really test theories of gravity,


00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.160
which would be terribly exciting.


00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.680
But of course the technology to do that is not there yet,


00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.280
but it is moving forward.


00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.400
And it's something we're thinking actively about.


00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.440
- It's getting there.


00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:07.360
Another thing you pointed out was


00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.760
all the results you got from this so far


00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:13.700
still back up the general theory of relativity, right?


00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:15.100
- That's right, yeah.


00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.000
Einstein seems to be still correct.


00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.440
Our black hole shadows are still very circular,


00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.480
which is what Einstein's theory predicts,


00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:24.320
but we need much sharper images to see bigger differences.


00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.100
We were able to rule out some theories,


00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.520
but there are still some theories that survive.


00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:31.380
So we need to get to sharper and sharper images


00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.340
and stronger and stronger tests.


00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.100
But I think we're moving in that direction.


00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:38.220
Our first image is really just opened this new laboratory


00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:39.960
of images of black holes.


00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.140
So it's gonna be an exciting new field.


00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:44.660
- Yeah, this is possible.


00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:46.780
Now let's build on it, right?


00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:48.400
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.940
- Awesome.


00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:52.120
All right, well, I think we'll leave it there


00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:55.460
for the black holes, but congratulations to you.


00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.460
And I know that all the other people,


00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.660
Often you point out that you're just the representative


01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.420
for this great big team.


01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.060
- Yeah, I only play a small part.


01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.420
It's really a big team effort and a community effort


01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.700
and everybody is part of it.


01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.620
- Yeah, indeed.


01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.760
Now, before you get out of here,


01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.500
let me ask you the final two questions.


01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.260
I always ask, if you're gonna write some Python code,


01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.960
what editor do you use these days?


01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.800
- What editor?


01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.600
Oh my God, I'm super boring.


01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.440
I use GEdit.


01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.100
(both laughing)


01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:25.940
- You use what?


01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:26.760
Sorry.


01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.760
- Oh, perfect. Awesome. - Yeah, very boring.


01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:33.760
And then, if there's any Python package library you want to give a shout out to,


01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.760
maybe that was central to this work.


01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.760
I know you already mentioned Pandas and Matplotlib.


01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.760
Anything else that was really useful here?


01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.760
Yeah, there was a really cool nested sampling algorithm


01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.760
that was developed by a Harvard grad student called Dynasty


01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.760
that was super useful for our modeling work


01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.760
and really kicked off a lot of that analysis.


01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.760
So I'd like to shout that out to you.


01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.760
- And it's open source. - Yeah, fantastic.


01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.760
Yeah, awesome. I'll put a link to it in the show notes for people.


01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.760
Alright, well Sarah, thank you so much for coming on the show, for sharing your work.


01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.760
It's, you know, as you saw, it's been an inspiration to everyone around the world.


01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.760
So, thank you.


01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.760
Yeah, thank you for having me.


01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.760
Yeah, you bet. Bye.


01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:25.760
