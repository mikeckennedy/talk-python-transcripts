00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.380
Nikhil, Elvis, welcome to Talk Python, you guys.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.380
Hey, it's great to be here.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.340
Yeah, it's awesome to have you here.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.620
You're building some cool products, and Nikhil, you're back on the show.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:22.140
We spoke to you back in Salt Lake City at Startup Row,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.860
and now your startup is more started,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.300
and I'm really excited to hear about it,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.320
and that's what we're mostly going to focus on this episode,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.000
talking about building Python web apps.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.980
Normally when you say something like that,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.100
a person who is not a web developer would go,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.600
oh, you're building apps with Python, web apps with Python, that's cool.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.400
A web developer would be like, okay, what is that?

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.260
That's Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, React, etc., SQL.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.340
There's a lot going on normally,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.860
but we can winnow it down a little bit and have a little more focus.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.340
When we say Python web apps, it's a little more like that, right?

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.420
Yeah, definitely.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.960
I think a lot of people, when they hear Python web apps,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380
they think of Django, Flask.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.600
They call themselves Python web frameworks,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.680
and they're really great frameworks.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.580
But like you mentioned, there's a lot of things that go into web development.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.160
There's front-end, back-end hosting, etc.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.120
And when you think of frameworks like Django, Flask,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.040
they do a great job of handling the back-end, the database,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.320
the kind of connection layer.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.360
But like you mentioned, when you have to write the front-end,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.140
you end up having to kind of go back to HTML, React, JavaScript,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.580
and the traditional tools.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.620
And generally in web development,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.480
you'll set up your back-end as kind of one service,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.500
your front-end as one service,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.720
hook them up through some sort of API and develop through that.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.560
And it works great,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.320
but one part, like you mentioned,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.640
is there's a lack of unification.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.540
So when it comes to building an app,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.740
you have to piece together a front-end, a back-end,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.240
then figure out how to host it.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.160
So a really big part of why we started Reflex

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.820
was to kind of simplify all these different layers of web development

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.240
into one batteries-included framework.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.480
And one of the biggest challenges,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.800
along with the batteries included,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.820
is having everything built in,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.000
but also keeping it flexible enough, right?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.140
Because people want to do all sorts of stuff

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.840
with their web apps.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.800
So that's really one of the main challenges

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.880
that we faced going through all this

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.940
was how can we make a framework

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.520
that people can just get started,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.280
but it doesn't box them in.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.500
They can still make all the stuff

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.560
they were going to make using their JavaScript apps.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.240
Right.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.820
That is the big challenge.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.160
And we're going to dive into that.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.300
You guys got some awesome stuff.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.460
But before we do,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.160
maybe it's been two years or so

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.020
since you've been on the show.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.100
Give a quick introduction,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.280
just who you are,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.060
how you got here.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.700
So yeah, I'm Nikhil.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.180
I'm co-founder here at Reflex.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.040
Last time we chatted was about a year and a half ago.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.560
At that time,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.840
our company name was Pinecone with a Y.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.160
That was at Startup Row.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.980
And our mission when we started,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.660
and even now,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.520
is to just simplify the whole process

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.240
of web development

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.300
from front-end, back-end, hosting,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.340
all these parts,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.700
and make a framework

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.140
that simplifies all these parts

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.380
so a newcomer can easily

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.560
share their ideas

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.080
without getting all caught up

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.740
in learning new tools,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.600
learning new languages,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.740
boilerplate,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.380
boilerplate,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.920
and all this.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.520
So that's been our goal from the start.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.100
And maybe just some background

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.180
on why we even came to this idea.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.460
So prior to working on this,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.040
I was working at a self-driving car startup

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.120
and then I was working at Apple.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.500
And at both these roles,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.200
I was working on AI teams

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.100
with really talented engineers.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.700
But we were all Python engineers.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.700
So we could do anything with database,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.680
backend, all this stuff.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.780
but when it came to something

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.100
as simple as make a UI for this app,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.780
make a dashboard to showcase this data,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.560
you know, make a little form

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.380
to submit it,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.080
you know, there's sometimes

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.280
these senior engineers would be like,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.480
okay, that's not my domain.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.020
I can't do that in Python.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.960
You know, someone else can handle this.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.640
Sure, I have a PhD in machine learning,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.620
but I can't build a website.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.820
So now what?

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.540
Exactly.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.920
And that's kind of where we are.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.540
And a big reason of that is

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.660
if you think about, you know,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.280
different languages

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.080
and their use cases,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.640
Python is used in so many,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.320
it's one of the most broad languages.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.140
if you think about all the areas it's used,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.540
backend, databases, AI, ML,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.480
all these areas,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.560
but there's really one place

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.480
that it's not used traditionally.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.720
And that's kind of front-end development.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.180
And for there, like JavaScript is king.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.620
And if you take the inverse of that

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.080
and think about JavaScript,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.560
it's one of the most popular languages

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.220
in the world, right?

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.140
Like it's one, two, or three up there.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.440
And if you think about the use case for it,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.760
it's mostly all around web applications.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.620
So what we see,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.780
what we kind of notice is,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.700
you know, people love Python.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.100
They want to do all their work in Python

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.920
when it's accessible.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.920
And people love web development

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.100
and they use JavaScript

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.380
because they love web development,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.580
but there's not much usage of JavaScript

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.480
outside that domain.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.580
So really our big focus was,

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.060
well, can we fill in this gap

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.080
in the Python ecosystem

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.960
where people are doing everything in Python

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.460
and then suddenly this one domain

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.020
of websites, front-ends,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.580
that can't be handled

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.660
and they need to, you know,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.940
use a different tool,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.700
use a different language,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.460
outsource that.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.820
And that was a big thing

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.620
we wanted to solve.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.900
the same people

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.520
with the ideas,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.240
building the backend,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.840
building the AI,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.300
building the whatever it is,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.180
should be also the people presenting it,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.620
building the UI layer

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.300
and kind of sharing their ideas.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.200
Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.060
Many people I talk to

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.920
would rather build everything in Python,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.100
but they end up

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.200
piecing it together

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.700
as they have to.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.840
Elvis, good to see you.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.600
Yeah, same.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.620
Yeah.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.140
Quick introduction about you.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.280
Yeah, so I guess we met at PyBay.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.640
Yeah, we did.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.500
Yeah, so that was very, very fun.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.200
And yeah, so I'm Elvis,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.020
he and his,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.120
I'm working at Reflex

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.320
as a developer advocate.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.320
And prior to this,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.620
I was working at Warp.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.240
So I was there like three years

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.980
doing like developer experience,

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.840
developer relations.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.780
Yeah.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.460
Shout out to Warp.dev, man.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.780
That is an awesome terminal.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.820
I really enjoy that.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.480
I use that pretty much universally now.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.260
And yeah,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.440
thank you for that recommendation.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.460
It's still going strong.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.220
Yeah, very good team.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.780
Yeah, awesome.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.380
So now you're working at Reflex,

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.740
formerly Pinecone,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.000
same company, new name.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.600
Yeah.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.080
Awesome.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.160
Yeah, even doing more,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.460
you know,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.400
this Warp is more Rust, right?

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.160
So now you're more

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.080
in the Python side of things, yeah?

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.160
Yeah, but even there,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.600
I was like,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.760
everything that I was building

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.020
was like internal tooling

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.140
to like optimize developer experience.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.180
And so everything was in Python.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.560
And so that's how I actually

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.920
came across Reflex.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.440
And then I was like,

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.240
oh, this is a dream,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.360
like being able to like work

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.120
in open source

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.920
and build Python apps

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.840
and like serve the community.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.220
And so when I saw that job posting,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.540
I was like,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.540
whoa, I would love to join.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.320
And they were in SF,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.060
so that was great.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.940
So I could just walk over

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.880
to the office and things.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.120
Yeah, that is kind of the magic

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.080
of San Francisco, right?

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.380
Like it's not you

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.660
and potentially a whole family

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.460
move thousands of miles away.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.520
It's just you take a different bus

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.440
or a different BART train

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.760
or something.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.480
Yeah.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.200
Yeah, very cool.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.040
All right.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.940
Well, Nigel,

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.860
let's talk really quickly

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.040
just about Startup Lane.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.060
You know, like we had,

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.720
I was just looking back on this

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.360
as I knew you were coming

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.900
on the show

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.400
and I was like,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.120
well, you know,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.080
what happened to all those companies?

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.240
And I don't have a great,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.960
totally good sense.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.380
I know that some of these

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.380
have pivoted.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.380
You know, we had Ponder.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.440
We have Generally Intelligent.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.680
We had Wereobots,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.260
Neptine,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.760
Nyxtla,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.440
Pretty Base,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.060
and Pinecone,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.900
which is now Reflex.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.520
And this was,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.020
well, what is this startup row

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.520
really quick

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.720
while we're on this topic?

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.980
Yeah, so.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.040
How'd you get on there?

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.400
Yeah, so this was back

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.200
when we first started.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.960
I think our company

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.460
was maybe one or two months old

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.340
and we had just got into,

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.840
we were part of the Y Combinator

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.800
Winter 23 batch.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.480
So while going through that,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.000
we launched on,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.920
I think, Hacker News

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.060
early January

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.700
and that's when we first started,

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.980
you know,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.160
publicizing our open source,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.000
getting users on it.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.940
And we got quite good traction

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.480
when we started

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.880
and part of,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.400
one of the events

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.940
that was happening

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.900
was PyCon,

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.620
which was,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.000
I believe,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.440
in April of that year.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.820
And it was a great opportunity

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.300
maybe for us

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.080
as a Python,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.560
you know,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.360
a Python company,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.820
it like to kind of

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.620
meet our audience.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.780
And so,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.580
yeah,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.340
so part of that

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.200
was the startup role

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.000
where there was a lot of,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.220
you know,

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:10.980
I think seed

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.380
or like very early state startups

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.940
coming to present.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.100
so at that time

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.060
we were maybe only

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.740
two months old.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.220
So very early,

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.060
but it was still

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.420
a great,

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.260
really great experience.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:21.620
You know,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.140
I think it was probably

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.840
the first event,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.520
you know,

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.940
that we've done

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.660
as a company.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.960
So that was a really

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.560
good experience

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.120
to meet

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.080
different Python developers

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.560
and to meet

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.640
all like the other developers

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.020
that,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.400
you know,

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.240
the companies you mentioned,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.000
like even ones

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.500
that were not,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.020
that aren't listed here.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.120
There's a bunch

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.980
of awesome Python people

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.480
that came there.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.720
Yeah,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.860
it's not just the companies

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.300
that are in startup row.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.520
That's its own special thing.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.860
But the whole expo floor hall

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.300
is a pretty awesome place

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.740
to just walk and mingle

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.480
and learn

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.440
what people are up to.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.620
Yeah,

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:53.920
definitely.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.960
Yeah,

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.180
yeah,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:55.520
that's cool.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.620
I know that Ponder,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.140
Ponder got acquired.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.760
So congrats to them.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.040
Oh,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.320
nice.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.700
They got acquired

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.620
by Snowflake.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.840
Nice.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.240
Yeah,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.760
that makes a lot of sense.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:05.940
Yeah.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.540
Yeah,

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.120
I know Generally Intelligent,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.040
their founders

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.080
are some of our friends.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.880
they're an investor

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.440
in our company.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.080
They rebranded now

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.960
to Imbue.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.920
So I think

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.080
they're doing well as well.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.000
Yeah,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.240
I think whoever put together

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.860
that group,

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.680
whoever selected

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.500
the companies that go there

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.040
did pretty good

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.320
because,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.540
you know,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.480
startups don't have

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.160
typically a huge likelihood

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.880
of succeeding,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.960
but I think most of these

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.420
are still around.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.000
So that's awesome.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.080
Yep.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.200
Yeah,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:31.440
cool.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.800
All right.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.300
Well,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.680
let's talk.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.860
We've introduced it

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.700
a little bit,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.880
but Reflex,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.420
let me just read,

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.440
I'll read the little,

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.140
the H1,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:43.840
the H2 for you

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.780
and then we'll go from there.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.880
It has that front end,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.300
back end,

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:46.820
pure Python,

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.800
and then the open source

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.880
framework to build

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.860
and deploy web apps

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.220
and no JavaScript required.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.180
There's a lot to unpack there.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.160
So,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.320
you know,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.860
tell people what Reflex is

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.400
and then we'll dig

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.500
into the use cases

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.440
and some of the open source

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.220
stuff and so on.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:03.240
Yeah,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.740
so like we kind of talked

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.300
about earlier,

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.160
Reflex is a Python framework

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.160
to build web apps

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.580
in Python

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.180
and it's an open source

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.520
framework,

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.980
so you don't have to sign up

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.420
for a SaaS

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:12.980
or do anything.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.400
You just do pip install Reflex,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.220
kind of like what's shown

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:15.640
at the bottom

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.120
and you can start using it

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.700
like any other Python library.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.520
And like I mentioned,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.720
the key distinction

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.520
that we're trying to do

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.940
is kind of unify

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.400
the whole web stack.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.960
So all the parts

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.780
that normally go

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.520
into web development,

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.360
building a front end,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.080
building a back end,

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.900
connecting them,

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.380
maybe including a database

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.680
and then deploying it,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.320
usually these involve

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.940
using several different tools,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.580
technologies,

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.360
even often multiple languages

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.660
and the overhead for that

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.440
could be really high.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.580
So if you think about before

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.880
like a full-fledged web app,

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.540
usually you're not going

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.000
to do that unless you have,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.380
you know,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.160
you have like a mission to do.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.360
Like you have something

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.060
you're trying to make,

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.080
you have it kind of spec'd out

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.240
and you're going to kind of

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.440
invest that effort into it.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.520
It's very hard

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.020
or most people aren't going to,

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:00.280
you know,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.260
prototype a web app

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.660
or kind of build out like that

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.700
because the overhead needed

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.560
is way too high

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.980
to kind of mess around with.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.800
So what generally happens,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.960
especially for Python developers

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.040
is they'll use Python scripts,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.280
they'll use Jupyter notebooks

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.420
and in the Python community also,

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.740
there's other pretty good frameworks,

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.080
things like Streamlit, Gradio,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.080
which are also in the Python environment

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.220
and I think try to target

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.380
a very similar problem

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.180
that we're doing where,

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.660
you know,

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.320
people have their data,

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.080
people know Python

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.240
and they want to showcase it.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.760
So these are kind of

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.840
the existing tools

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.720
that were there before we started

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.760
and I think they all have their place

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.700
to get started with

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.400
but they're very limiting

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.740
in what you can build with them, right?

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.660
Like it's good

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.960
for the most basic prototype.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.580
You can have a script,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.540
you can have a Jupyter notebook,

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.860
but this is not something

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.240
necessarily you'd want to share

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:44.980
within your team

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.580
to build up to a larger app.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.280
Like usually once it becomes

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.300
a bit more complex,

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.820
you hand it off to another team

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.060
or if you're brave,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:54.800
you go learn JavaScript

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.540
or something.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.240
But usually there's a point

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.540
where it's like,

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:57.820
all right,

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.520
I've done my job.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.240
Like someone else,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.600
like go make this production ready.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.540
And a big part of what we're

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.180
trying to do different at Reflex

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.200
is compared to other Python

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.060
and I'd even say other

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.240
like non-JavaScript frameworks

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.400
is to keep everything in,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.340
you know, Python

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.060
in one language

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.180
but without having

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.340
any of these trade-offs

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.200
that usually come with

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.080
a low-code or no-code platform.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.420
So usually low-code

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:19.940
and no-code,

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.760
they exchange,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.540
you know,

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.360
things like performance features,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.680
things like that

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.460
for usability.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.320
Customization.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.920
Customization.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.740
So you can build

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.920
a certain subset of apps

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.080
but you need to kind of,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.800
you know,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.900
keep your aspirations

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.740
confined to what

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.640
that framework's going to give you.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.020
Like you want some random component,

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.200
you want a mapping component,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.100
you have to hope

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:40.880
that framework has it.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.900
You want to integrate

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.780
with a certain database,

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.600
you have to, you know,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.460
hope that they're going

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.320
to give you that integration.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.200
So one of the very nice things

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.940
about Python is for,

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.180
especially the backend integrations,

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:50.420
right?

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.300
Like, actually,

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.280
before that,

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.300
let me just back up one second.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.460
So compared to a lot

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.080
of these low-code,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.320
our goal was to have

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.020
the same framework you use,

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.320
you can easily build

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.300
to prototype your app,

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:01.540
you know,

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.120
in a few hours,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.080
build a quick prototype

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:03.540
of your app

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.020
and you can use

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:05.720
that same framework

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.700
to then grow your app

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.100
all the way

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.120
to a production-grade app.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.100
So if you're like,

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.280
look at our main website,

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.160
reflex.dev,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.580
this entire website

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.600
was built in Reflex

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.460
so you can kind of see

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.340
that badge at the bottom.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.600
I think this is kind of

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.520
distinguishing thing

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.040
from others.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.400
Like,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.380
usually to build

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.500
a website like this,

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.080
you would need

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:21.680
to use JavaScript,

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.620
but this was entirely

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.560
built in Python

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.280
and Reflex

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.340
and it just goes

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:26.960
to show like

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.960
the kind of,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.240
you know,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:28.980
along what we're chatting

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.780
about of,

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.620
you can build,

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:30.880
you know,

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.660
a basic chat app,

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.620
a little prototype app

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.380
as kind of is shown

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.620
in the demo section

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.080
right below

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.820
on the landing page

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.860
where we have a bunch

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.260
of, you know,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.060
different use cases.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.300
So you can build

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:39.760
that prototype,

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.720
but you can also extend

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.420
that all the way

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.360
to a production app

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.080
that's, you know,

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.840
serving either internal users

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.420
or even in our case

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.100
for some startups

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.660
that are serving

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.100
external public users

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:49.740
using Reflex.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.020
Yeah,

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.640
a lot of times

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.260
when I talk to people

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.920
about these kind of apps,

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.960
often it's,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.800
like,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.400
we've got an internal app

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.900
and there's 20 people

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.300
using it

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.360
and it doesn't really matter

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.420
if it takes a little while

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.500
for the app to load up

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.000
and, you know,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.600
we're not worried

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.480
about SEO

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.720
or any of those things,

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:09.980
right?

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.820
but to make your

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.680
product a landing page

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:12.940
in it,

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.740
that's a pretty big deal.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.580
Yeah,

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.360
and I'm not saying

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.400
that's the typical

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.880
or intended use case.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.840
Sure, of course.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.960
Like, you know,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.600
there's other things

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.020
if you just want

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:21.860
a static landing page,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.820
but it was more to show

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.880
the extent

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.160
to which it could be used.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.820
But like you mentioned,

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.460
a lot of our,

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.180
there's kind of like

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.240
two domains of people

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.220
that want to use us.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.700
The main audience

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.700
is really developers,

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.220
engineers,

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.660
that are not web devs,

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.620
are not JavaScript devs.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.440
So obviously,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.280
that includes,

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:37.480
you know,

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.500
hardcore Python people

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.240
who are, you know,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.260
senior Python developers.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.380
But a lot,

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.680
it's also just like

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.280
anyone who knows

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:44.860
a bit of coding

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.240
because Python tends to be,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:46.600
you know,

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.220
people have taken

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.060
one CS class.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.100
It tends to be

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:49.660
a Python class.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.000
They've learned

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.960
a bit of Python.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.300
So we actually see

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.020
use cases outside

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.200
of even software engineering.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.880
So people in finance,

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.740
manufacturing,

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:57.340
biology,

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.300
where they,

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:58.900
you know,

00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.640
before had an Excel

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.020
spreadsheet,

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:00.560
but they knew

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.120
a little Python

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.800
and they're now able

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.460
to develop,

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:02.900
you know,

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.600
these internal apps

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.240
for their companies.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.180
So that's kind of

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.460
the developer

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.160
profile we're looking at.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.480
And in terms of

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.140
the companies

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.260
and use cases,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:13.960
it's a lot of,

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.220
you know,

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.160
small teams that

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.340
they want to do more

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.200
with the team they have.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.460
Like they,

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.020
like for,

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.720
on one hand,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.840
it's kind of startups.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.660
You have a one,

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.380
two person startup

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.480
and you need to get

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:22.640
your,

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.280
you know,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:23.960
app demoed.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.340
You're building

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:24.880
some AI thing

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.680
and you want to get it demoed.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.140
You don't want to go

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.280
hire a contractor

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.140
or a front-end developer

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.080
to build that.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.920
You want to iterate quickly

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.780
and kind of work

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.140
through that,

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:33.900
especially during

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.020
that iteration phase,

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:35.280
right?

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.240
Like when you want

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:37.560
to iterate,

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.820
you don't even know

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.440
fully what you want

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:39.760
to build.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.720
So it's really empowering

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.000
to,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.540
or what we're trying

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.380
to do is empower people

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.280
by giving them a tool

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:44.840
where they can iterate

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.680
on their ideas

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.080
and not have to depend

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.660
on someone else.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:48.660
Yeah,

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.500
I think one of the problems

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.500
with the low-code,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.300
no-code stuff

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.880
for people in our orbit

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.340
is they know code.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.860
They're good developers.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.320
Yeah.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.680
They just might not be

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.920
front-end developers

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.620
or designers

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.340
or whatever.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.460
So I think it's probably

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.100
a little frustrating

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:06.860
to work with

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.240
like really low-code,

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.680
no-code type of stuff

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.140
because you're like,

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:10.460
ah,

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.360
if I could just program,

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.120
there's just a little bit

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.780
of code would totally

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.440
make this work.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.000
Yeah.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.080
but it's in JavaScript

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.280
or it's in something else.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:17.600
Like,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.820
Elvis,

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.600
when you're talking

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.460
to people about this,

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:21.780
you know,

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.040
like,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.840
how do you present this

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.100
versus something like

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.920
Retool or Gradio

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.880
or something like that?

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.640
It's funny

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.600
because I was using Retool

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.860
at the last company

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.420
and one of my frustrations

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.080
was...

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:34.260
Yeah,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:34.860
and they've been

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.600
a sponsor of the show.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.000
I think they do make

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.780
pretty cool stuff,

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.360
but it's different, right?

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:39.940
Yeah,

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:40.380
it is different.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.320
I think Retool

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.020
is very powerful.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:42.960
They have a lot

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.700
of plug and play.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.040
I think the,

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.280
I think for someone

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:47.620
who's,

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.120
if you're coming

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.040
from a developer background,

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.460
I think you're so used

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.540
to having full control

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.520
that,

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.020
like,

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.100
giving some of that

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:54.760
control away

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.940
can be a difficult adjustment

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.240
and I think one of the

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.260
nice things about Reflex

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:58.760
is that

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.420
all of these UI components

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.660
get transpiled

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.560
into React,

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.020
right?

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:03.960
And so,

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.480
one of the key value props

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.420
is that you're bringing

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.160
an entire ecosystem

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:08.860
closer

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:10.320
to backend people

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.400
and so,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:11.940
like,

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.040
we,

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.460
like,

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.300
there's a couple companies

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.260
that will have someone

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.180
doing frontend

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.680
and making components

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.700
just for their

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.680
internal tools team

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.420
and it's like,

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.180
you can just wrap those

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:20.720
in Reflex

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.820
and now,

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:22.700
all of your components

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.500
still adhere

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:23.760
to,

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:23.920
like,

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.740
your style guide

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.880
or to your theme

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.520
and so,

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:26.860
you're not really,

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.040
like,

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.760
limiting people

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.320
in terms of,

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:28.580
like,

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.520
the components

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.180
that they have

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.960
available to them

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.760
because it is

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.840
React under the hood.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.440
Oh,

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.160
that's pretty interesting.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.320
Yeah,

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:34.960
it's very elegant

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.040
because it turns

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.180
into FastAPI

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:37.960
and React

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.720
so it's like,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.120
you're not really limited

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.120
when it comes to,

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.320
like,

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.740
producing apps

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.680
that can get bigger

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:43.940
or,

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.140
like,

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.460
scale

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.120
or have,

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.300
like,

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.120
routes and things.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:46.960
Mm-hmm.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.460
Yeah.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.340
Okay,

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:48.760
that's cool.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.120
So,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.660
it's

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.520
basically some developer

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.720
tooling on top

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.000
of React

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.980
and then,

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.480
so what you end up

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.240
programming is probably

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.280
mostly generates React

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.380
and then it's also

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.920
FastAPI on the back end.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.780
That's really neat.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.380
Yeah,

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:04.580
so,

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:04.900
well,

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.300
basically going back to,

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.720
as we're developing this,

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.080
the most important thing

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.940
we kept in mind was,

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.160
okay,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.380
we want to make it really easy,

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:11.820
you know,

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.620
a newcomer should be able

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:13.240
to build this

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.300
but not have,

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.120
pretty much have ways

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.760
to do anything,

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.000
right?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.180
Like,

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.180
never make people hit

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.660
that graduation point

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.100
where they're like,

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:21.320
okay,

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.380
I've hit the limits of Reflex,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.160
let's go use a serious framework

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.800
like React.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:25.440
So,

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.640
it's very intentional

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.200
that people never hit that goal

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:28.480
and,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.680
like,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.060
one way that we achieve that is,

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.400
you code everything in Python

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.380
but the end output

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.260
that it compiles to

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.860
is a production-grade web app.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.440
So,

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.200
for the front end,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.320
though you're coding it in Python,

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.680
the front end will compile out

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.640
to a Next.js app.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.240
The back end will compile out

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.500
to a FastAPI back end

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.420
that hook up together.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.080
So,

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:46.660
it's pretty much

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.540
the same architecture

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.080
you would write

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.580
as if you were writing it by hand.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.120
So,

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.500
there's no,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.080
there's,

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.400
like,

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.200
we're not taking a shortcut

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.640
as in,

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:52.900
like,

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.040
if you were to write it by hand,

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:54.780
it would actually compile.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.640
you would probably write

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.480
a Next.js front end,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.700
FastAPI back end,

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.340
and connect it.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.220
And we're kind of giving

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.480
a layer on top of that.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.460
And by developing on top of React,

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.500
it goes back to this,

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.120
you know,

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.680
we don't want to reinvent the wheel.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.640
Web dev is a really mature ecosystem.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.440
We're not going to be able to,

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.000
you know,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.860
remake React

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.160
and all the components out there.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:12.860
So,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.360
when we started,

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:13.360
so when we started,

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.320
our big approach was,

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.360
let's wrap React.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.360
And not only,

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:17.940
like,

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.140
our,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.000
do our components wrap React,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.620
but we make it very easy

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.700
for developers

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.900
to wrap their own components.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.680
So,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.780
kind of like what Elvis said,

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.740
we have companies,

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.200
like,

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.280
Fortune 100 companies

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.400
that internally,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.520
they have their own React,

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:30.900
you know,

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.700
component library

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.840
that they must use

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.580
for every app

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.140
that they're building.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.520
And they were able

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.660
to wrap those in Reflex,

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.420
and now they can use,

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:37.680
you know,

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.240
their private,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.500
custom React components.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.120
One person wrapped it once,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.500
and now any Python developer

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.600
is able to access it

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.800
and develop with it.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.300
So,

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.320
our really big point is,

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:46.560
like,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.840
you're not going to be locked in.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.240
We have,

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:48.460
you know,

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.880
60 plus components built in,

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.400
but anything that's possible

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.260
in React and JavaScript,

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.320
you can easily bring that

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:53.760
to Reflex

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.780
without waiting for us.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.540
Yeah.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:57.060
Okay.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.280
So,

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.600
there's a bit of an escape hatch

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.880
to just go down straight

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.380
to React.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.540
Well,

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:01.940
yes,

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.740
but the nice part

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.620
is you don't have to write

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.480
the React directly.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:05.840
I mean,

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.780
you can write it once,

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.080
but after that,

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.000
we have a third-party

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.980
component ecosystem.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.560
I can show you

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.580
on our website later as well,

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.900
but many people have published

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.080
their own third-party components.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.960
Oh,

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.300
interesting.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.180
For example,

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:17.360
like,

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.320
we don't have a map component

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:18.760
built in.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.240
So,

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:19.640
last week,

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.240
someone published

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.520
our Reflex map component.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:21.720
So,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.100
if you want to,

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.240
like,

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:22.880
hook up a map

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.960
into your thing,

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.880
it's now possible.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.400
And there's a lot of these-

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:26.900
AG Grid.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:27.100
Yeah,

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:27.740
AG Grid,

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.060
you know,

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:28.720
audio recording,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.160
and all these,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:29.400
like,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.440
niche cases,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:30.700
right,

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.620
where we're not going to

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.380
able to support it all.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.420
But the nice part

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.360
about having an open source

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.220
and open source community

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.340
is community can add

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.060
to the project,

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.080
shared with others,

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.080
and everyone can benefit

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.540
from it.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.580
Cool.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.480
So,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.920
another one of the challenges

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.080
of low-code,

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.800
no-code type stuff

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.720
has to do with the

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.480
deployment side of things.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:50.960
you know,

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.900
I maybe buy a

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.600
SaaS subscription

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.840
at some low-code place,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.740
but,

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.380
you know,

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.180
in practice,

00:20:59.180 --> 00:20:59.600
the,

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.520
I don't know,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.100
the performance

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.260
is just not good enough

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:02.500
to,

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.820
if you put it on the internet,

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.020
it'll just not take it

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.640
or something like that,

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:05.860
right?

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.160
But if it's,

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:07.960
if it's basically

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.380
JavaScript over

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.720
FastAPI,

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.080
like,

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.980
that's a very well-known

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.300
and super scalable

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:14.680
setup,

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.040
right?

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.060
Yeah,

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:16.520
exactly.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:16.960
And,

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.660
and so part of that

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.860
is in the unification,

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.780
it wasn't only front-end,

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.160
back-end,

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.160
it was also deployment,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.480
which a lot of people,

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.220
they build their app

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.460
and deployment takes as long,

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.100
if not longer,

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.720
than the actual building.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.820
And the DevOps

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.860
all along the way,

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.080
yeah.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:30.340
Yeah,

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.100
especially if you've never

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:31.600
done this,

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:31.860
right?

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:32.120
Like,

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:32.820
to go learn about,

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.080
you know,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.820
how to domain names

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.740
and what is,

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:34.960
like,

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.460
SSL,

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.180
what is S3,

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:36.660
SSL,

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:36.820
like,

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.600
all these things

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.320
take a long time.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.620
And that,

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:39.860
so,

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.300
and going back to the thing

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.700
of balancing that thing

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.560
of batteries included,

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:43.940
yet,

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.820
if you don't want to use

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.260
our batteries,

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:45.640
you know,

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.280
you should be able

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.040
to self-host it.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.720
So,

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.680
along those lines,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.360
what we've included

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.160
in Reflex is

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.480
a one-line deploy.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:51.780
So,

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:52.760
after you've built your app,

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.800
you can just type

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.460
Reflex deploy.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.220
We set up all the infrastructure

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.720
and you'll get a URL back

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.400
that anyone can access

00:21:59.400 --> 00:21:59.940
your app through.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:00.620
So,

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.820
we have the actual hosting

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.680
service built in

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.780
as well to Reflex.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.740
And,

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.880
if you don't want to use that,

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.680
like many companies,

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.000
you know,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.660
say you want to deploy

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.380
on your private cloud

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:08.920
or et cetera,

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.080
we're really like,

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.700
it's really important to us

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.060
to stay with like open source

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.080
and make it so,

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:15.400
you know,

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.620
if you want to use it

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.300
in your own use case,

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.040
that's always possible.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.260
So,

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.600
we have guides

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.380
and make it easy

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.080
to deploy on all these.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:21.660
And like you said,

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.360
because it's kind of

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.020
a standard output,

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.860
it's kind of easy

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.740
to self-host it yourself

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.120
as well.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:26.560
Right,

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:26.780
right.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.800
What you know about

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.660
running FastAPI

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.020
probably translates pretty well.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.020
Yep.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.780
What's the database story?

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.240
There's got to be

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:34.900
a database,

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.280
right?

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.720
Yep.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.080
So,

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.260
so,

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.440
this goes back

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.100
to like the whole

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.140
batteries yet flexible.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:41.480
So,

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.920
we have a built-in arm

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.200
similar to Django.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.940
It's nothing but a kind

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.200
of light wrapper

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.060
around SQLAlchemy

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.840
but kind of hooked up

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.560
more to Reflex.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.080
So,

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.920
kind of taking care

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.800
of some abstractions

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.940
in terms of making

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.720
the models work

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.640
with Reflex state,

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.000
et cetera.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.860
So,

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.780
the nice part is

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.520
we have first-class support

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.560
for any SQL database

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.920
because of the SQLAlchemy

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.940
like tight integration.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.940
So,

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.380
when you start Reflex,

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.280
you have a built-in

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.060
SQLite database

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:09.920
database that gets,

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.460
you know,

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.640
any app that wants it,

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.560
it's there for you.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.120
You don't have to do

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.860
any setup.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.580
So,

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.400
you can start developing

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.680
with databases right away

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.640
like without,

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.100
you know,

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.840
having to learn too much

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.400
outside or doing any setup.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.760
And then once you want

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.320
to go to,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:22.580
you know,

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:22.980
production,

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:23.560
deployment,

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.600
and you want to use,

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:24.880
say,

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.280
Postgres,

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:25.720
MySQL,

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.860
or whatever you want

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:27.580
to use for your

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.460
actual database,

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.340
it's just a matter

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.180
of in our config

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.440
putting the database

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.260
URL that you want.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.100
So,

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.220
we make it really easy

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:35.760
to partner

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.500
with whatever you're doing.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.140
so a lot of people

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.020
use us with providers

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:39.760
like Supabase,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.180
Neon,

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.300
where they set up

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:41.800
their database

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.540
using one of these

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.520
providers and they can

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.100
easily connect it

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.560
to their app.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.380
Yeah,

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:45.840
that's cool.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.080
So,

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:46.860
basically anything

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.860
SQLAlchemy supports,

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:48.660
just set the connection

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.980
string and you're good to go.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.480
Yeah,

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.100
and along that line,

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.300
right,

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.000
like a lot of people

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.340
ask us follow-up questions

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:54.640
like,

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.260
well,

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:55.740
how do you handle

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:56.300
MongoDB?

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:56.920
how do you handle

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.320
NoSQL?

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.160
How do you handle

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.140
like XYZ tool

00:23:59.140 --> 00:23:59.960
that I want to use

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.620
in my app?

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.460
And,

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.320
you know,

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.720
this is another part

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.060
where I think

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:04.680
our big advantage

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.380
over low-code,

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.020
no-code frameworks

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:06.380
where,

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.120
you know,

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.220
if you want,

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.000
say,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.780
a drag-and-drop builder

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.480
to support

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.080
your random database,

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.540
because there's no code in it,

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.520
you're kind of dependent

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:14.900
on them,

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.120
right?

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.660
Yeah,

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:15.920
yeah,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:15.980
yeah.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.320
For us,

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.040
we kind of have this

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.940
kind of nice privilege

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:18.400
where we can say,

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:18.620
hey,

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.260
it's just Python.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.640
Go use the Python library.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.460
Anything you can do

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:21.840
in Python,

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.560
you can like integrate

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.120
in Reflex.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.260
So we give a lot

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.060
of first-class support,

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.780
but a lot of what we're doing

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.620
is we're on the shoulders

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.960
of React and Python.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.180
Oh,

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:30.600
interesting.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.540
So if I wanted to use,

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:31.740
say,

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.060
Beanie and Pydantic

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:33.860
and MongoDB,

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.500
I just do that?

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.560
Just do pip install,

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.680
whatever the library is,

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.720
and use it like any Python.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.020
So,

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:39.840
for example,

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.120
like a huge use case

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:41.820
people use us with

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.060
is,

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:42.500
you know,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.120
AI apps.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:43.620
So a lot of people

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.260
use OpenAI,

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:44.700
Anthropic,

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.200
and all this.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.180
And it's just

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.100
the Python library away.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:47.740
And oftentimes,

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.100
they already have written

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.100
that Python script first,

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:51.360
right?

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.160
And they just want a UI

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:52.780
on top of it.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.620
so it's like even easier

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.440
to hook up at that point.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.540
Yeah,

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.500
that's very cool.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.840
Elvis,

00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.520
anything you want to add

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.360
to that before we move on?

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.920
This whole deployment,

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.800
managing,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.040
DevOps-y side of things?

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:04.240
Yeah,

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:04.800
it definitely,

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.700
it reminds me of the quote

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.180
where like,

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.700
any like sufficiently

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.260
advanced technology

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.720
is like indistinguishable

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.300
from magic.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.340
Because like,

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.640
like we recently sponsored

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.420
CalHacks,

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.800
and like being able

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.780
to like see people

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.680
who are taking like

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.300
CS1,

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.100
CS2,

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.840
like the magic

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.820
like in their eyes

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.680
and like they can

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.340
like run it

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.280
and then like a website

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:24.800
comes up.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.660
Like that's,

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.920
it's just so compelling,

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.440
you know?

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.620
And then so like,

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.620
for me,

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.260
I'm just like looking

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.080
forward to the future

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.180
where more people

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:32.820
can use it

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.500
and then we can just

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.000
like make

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.360
like the web ecosystem

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.600
like more democratized,

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:36.940
you know?

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.300
just giving power

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.440
to people who like

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.920
don't have

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.900
a JavaScript experience,

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.200
you know?

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.380
Yeah,

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:42.940
it's a big part

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.660
of the Python story

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.020
as well,

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.300
right?

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.160
You know,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.700
one of the alternatives

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.980
to this is notebooks,

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.420
right?

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:48.820
Which I know

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.580
it's not even close

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.200
to the same thing,

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.060
but a lot of people

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.540
who are not web developers

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.100
or just don't want

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:54.660
to take a month

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.380
to build a website,

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.020
right?

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.680
They'll kind of create

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.040
a notebook

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:57.940
and use the notebook

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.280
to visually communicate

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.200
in interesting ways,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.460
right?

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.860
But when it comes down

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.000
to I want something

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.580
that feels like

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.200
a website for someone,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200
it kind of falls short

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.840
most of the time

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:08.700
to use a notebook

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.140
for that.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:09.800
Yeah,

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.320
but it is,

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.060
that has,

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:11.480
sorry,

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.240
the reason I brought it up

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.040
is notebooks totally

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.600
democratized visualization

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.180
and interaction

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.220
for data scientists

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:19.860
in a way

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.620
that was massive.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.780
No,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.020
yeah,

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:22.760
I completely agree

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.380
and I think,

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.460
I think most people

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:24.820
would agree

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.680
like a web interface

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.640
is nicer than a notebook,

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.260
but a notebook

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:27.960
is so much easier

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.320
to build,

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.500
right?

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.220
So when considering

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:29.700
that trade-off,

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:29.980
people are like,

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.340
all right,

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.180
here's my Jupyter notebook

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.400
and what we're trying

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:32.720
to hope

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.600
or what we're trying

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.840
to do is make it

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.380
as easy to,

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:35.600
okay,

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.440
convert your notebook

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:36.900
to a website

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.680
that's more easily

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.160
shareable,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.700
more easily kind of

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.260
deployable

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.400
and all this other stuff

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.320
and I guess along

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:43.700
those lines,

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:44.620
I think we're going

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.400
to chat about it

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.040
maybe a bit later,

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.600
but our goal,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.200
like right now,

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.420
a big part of it

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.300
is making,

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:50.640
okay,

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.420
you can write your UI

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:51.900
in Python,

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.220
right?

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.020
So it's making

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:53.600
that part of it

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.140
more accessible,

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.540
but our goal

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.400
is not necessarily,

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.300
you know,

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.400
to stop at Python.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.180
Our goal is just

00:26:59.180 --> 00:26:59.720
to make it easy

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.540
for someone with an idea

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.420
to build a web app.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.580
So along those

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:02.960
lines,

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:03.920
like as we started,

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.680
a lot of the

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.560
positive comments

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.120
people have said

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:07.400
is okay,

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:07.920
now I can,

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.220
you know,

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.000
one language,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.500
one framework,

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.780
but still,

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:11.620
it's just because

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.140
you know Python,

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:12.860
that doesn't suddenly

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:13.580
mean you're a designer,

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:14.380
you're a web developer,

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.920
like I can now make,

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.200
you know,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.520
an Airbnb style website

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.420
just because the HTML

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.240
is now in Python.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.780
So a big part

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.300
of what we're trying

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.960
to do is accelerate

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.460
a lot of the entire process

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.180
because fundamentally,

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.200
I think people have

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.260
in their mind,

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:30.900
like they know

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.340
what they want to build.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:32.520
Yeah,

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.360
they know what it looks

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.060
like in their head.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:34.500
In their mind,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.420
they can visualize it,

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.060
but it's kind of

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.420
their technical implementation

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.120
and their tool,

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.100
like all of those

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:39.960
are not good enough

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.560
for what's in their mind

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.560
to become reality.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.160
So that's why

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:43.680
they have to settle

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.160
for notebooks,

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:44.800
settle for,

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.340
you know,

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:45.900
an approximation

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:46.920
of what's in their mind

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.500
because they're like,

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:47.700
okay,

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.780
this is with my time

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:49.520
and effort and tools.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.680
This is like

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.900
what I'm trying to do.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.020
And along those lines,

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:54.660
so I think Python

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.540
is definitely

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.620
one good aspect of it

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:57.240
because, you know,

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.400
it's now in their language.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.300
We're trying to bring it

00:27:59.300 --> 00:27:59.900
to where they are.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.460
But there's a lot of stuff

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.380
that I think

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.920
the whole web dev ecosystem

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.600
is going to change

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.660
in the upcoming years.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.600
And we want to be part

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.060
of this kind of new age

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.600
of frameworks

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.380
that's incorporating

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.300
things like AI

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.420
along with code

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.580
and kind of that

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.900
integration between the two

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.160
where a lot of stuff,

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.480
you know,

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.460
that's easier to do in AI,

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.200
it makes sense to do there.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.040
But it's important

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:22.960
that the output of that

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.380
is something

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.020
that the developer

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:24.840
can understand,

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.240
edit,

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.500
and kind of work with.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.200
So it's still

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.140
their contribution

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:28.720
that's getting,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.300
you know,

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:29.920
built in the end.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.940
Yeah.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.720
Yeah, that's,

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.800
I'm skeptical

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.200
of many integrations

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:35.900
of AI

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:36.460
into,

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.500
I'll say,

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.340
most apps.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.800
But I've seen,

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.260
I know you're leaning

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:41.780
towards not playing

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.180
a little bit.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.000
It's pretty neat.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.500
So yeah,

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.380
we'll get to that.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.540
But yeah,

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.360
it's pretty empowering

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:47.940
because,

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.600
you know,

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.320
if you just stare

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.000
at a blank screen

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.740
of HTML

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:52.460
where it literally

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:52.920
just says

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.500
angle bracket,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.400
HTML angle bracket,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:54.760
body,

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.280
now what?

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:55.620
Like,

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.500
that's daunting,

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.000
you know?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.640
I think that's kind

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.440
of the point

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.240
we're trying to go after

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:01.860
because there is,

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.860
you've probably seen,

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.140
like,

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:03.980
there's a lot of AI

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.840
website generators

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:05.740
that,

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:05.980
you know,

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.480
they'll make

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.480
kind of your landing page.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.140
I think there's

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.140
two real downsides

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.200
to a lot of existing ones

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.640
that we're trying

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.800
to kind of attack differently.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.200
One is,

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:15.940
they're mostly meant

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:16.800
for static sites,

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.040
right?

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:17.440
Like,

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.280
they'll give you your thing,

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:18.920
but it's very hard

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.900
to add your actual stuff

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:21.220
to it.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:22.480
and part of that

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.620
is they generate

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.260
kind of the stuff,

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.080
but it's not in a way

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:26.620
that's usable

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.380
by the end user.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.740
So you could generate

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:29.920
a nice dashboard interface,

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.540
but for a developer,

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:31.880
they're like,

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.040
well,

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.500
how do I actually

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.200
put my data in there?

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.000
How do I hook it up

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.520
with my database?

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.300
How do I actually make

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.540
this nice thing

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.280
actually practical?

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.740
So I think that's

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:39.300
kind of the approach

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.020
we're trying to do

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.560
is like once,

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.140
if we have these AI features,

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.700
it's not just an AI to build.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.780
It's something that

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.960
the developer can also,

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.300
you know,

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.560
understand the output with

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.520
and work with it.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.240
So it's like Python,

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.720
we see as great in this,

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.600
in this thing

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.840
as like an intermediate language

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.020
with which both AI

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.820
can kind of write to

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.380
and a developer

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.200
can actually understand

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:57.660
in the end

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.160
compared to an AI

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.080
outputting a bunch

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:00.780
of React code,

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:01.620
which would be really hard

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.600
for then a Python developer

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.720
to actually go make

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.640
modifications with.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.440
Yeah,

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.000
exactly.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.360
It's write only.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.520
You can't do much

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.380
with it after it's created.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:09.880
Yeah,

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.120
exactly.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.100
Cool.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:11.420
All right,

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.660
before we talk,

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.380
I want to talk through

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.440
some of the little examples

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.740
and what code looks like

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:16.620
within the constraints

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.020
of a mostly audio show

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.200
to the extent that we can do that.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.760
But I want to talk

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.280
open source first

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:21.840
because,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.560
you know,

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.080
one of the considerations

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.160
when you guys said,

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:26.300
hey,

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.740
let's circle back

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.480
and talk about Reflex.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:29.800
I'm like,

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.020
wait,

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.560
I don't know what Reflex is,

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.500
but then it's Pinecone,

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:32.680
right?

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.220
I'm always a little bit

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:36.880
hesitant to have

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.480
just a company

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.480
on the show

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.600
because I'm afraid

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:39.920
it's just,

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.140
well,

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:40.860
we're just going to talk

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.660
about our product all day.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:41.880
But,

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.580
you know,

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.580
I think there's one,

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.780
I feel like

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.660
having an option

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.520
to write Python code

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.740
across the board

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.860
is super interesting

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.860
for Python people.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.240
There's a few other things

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.420
that I've covered previously

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.440
that are somewhat like that,

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.780
like Anvil is close,

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.140
but it has a very different approach

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.480
and Streamlit.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.620
Very different approach,

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:04.800
but kind of somewhat,

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.340
very slightly sort of similar output,

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.500
but not the same for sure.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.440
But also just this,

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.140
the fact that you guys have this

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.640
also as open source,

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.240
I think that that's a,

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.760
that's a pretty compelling option.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.020
And so I,

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:18.660
you know,

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.560
one of the things I think

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.760
this makes it pretty relevant

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.400
for people.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.140
And then I looked at the GitHub repository

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.540
and it has 20,000 stars.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.940
That's like a third of Flask

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.220
or a third of Django.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.040
That's pretty good,

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:29.420
you guys.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.760
Yeah.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.160
I mean,

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.000
so when we started,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.100
we always wanted to open source it

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:34.680
from the start.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.380
I think that was like

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:35.660
very,

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.640
very important to us.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.360
I think our idea was

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.200
I'd rather have,

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:39.920
you know,

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.120
a large number of users

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.120
and only X percent of them

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.100
say on a paid product

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.820
than a small number of users

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.440
that are all paying.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.500
Like our biggest thing

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.220
is all about kind of the community.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.840
And related to that,

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.400
I don't think there's been many,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.340
especially in like,

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.360
say web frameworks.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.580
I can't really think of

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.380
many web frameworks

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.300
that are not open source

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.880
that have really took off

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.780
because a big part of things

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.080
like web frameworks

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.440
are the ecosystem around it, right?

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.060
Like it's not just the framework,

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.080
but what are all the stuff

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.060
people build on top of it?

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:08.800
Like the integrations,

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.440
the components,

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.960
the tutorials

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.200
and all this stuff around it.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.540
So a big part of

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.960
what we wanted to do

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.940
was open source it,

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:17.860
make it really easy

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.800
for people to get started

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.540
and not have a huge like

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.460
burden to even,

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.320
start and yeah,

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:24.920
pretty much lower

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.060
all the activation energy

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:26.840
that someone would need

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.820
to get their first app

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.480
up and running.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.740
Yeah.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.500
Yeah.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.600
And actually the open source

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.340
has really been good.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.140
Like it's been awesome

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:35.860
for our community.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.100
So when we first started

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.160
like a year and a half ago,

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:40.640
like people,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.560
what is very surprising to me,

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.540
like this is the first time

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.880
I've done an open source project,

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.980
like, you know,

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.000
let an open source project.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.020
and it's,

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.240
what was most surprising

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.240
in a positive way

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.220
was like how many people

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.480
are eager to contribute

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.040
to open source.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.000
Like I did not expect

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.080
when I started,

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.200
but like so many people

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:58.620
were like,

00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.660
hey, can I work on this?

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.660
Hey, can I add this feature?

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.940
And what's really nice is

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.320
like we have our reflex core

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.380
stuff that we're working on,

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.820
but everyone has a different

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.560
use case of what they're

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.400
trying to build with it.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:09.960
Right.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.960
So it's like this balance

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.500
of like, okay,

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.100
we have a plan of our roadmap.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.400
We're going to add these features.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.060
But then other people will say,

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.500
well, I want an audio component

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.120
for this and I want this.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.240
And the nice part

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.020
about being open source

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.720
is we really encourage people

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.240
to add their own stuff to it.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.980
When they hit a bug,

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:26.860
a lot of people are like,

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.620
all right, it's open source.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.580
I can just go fix the bug.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.280
I don't have to rely

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.100
on the maintainers.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.020
So for the,

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.320
and like going back to,

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:33.800
you know,

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.740
kind of the velocity

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.780
because we started around

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:36.560
a year and a half ago

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.040
and I think we're getting

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.060
pretty good traction

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:39.880
and a lot of that

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.200
is because of our great

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:41.780
kind of community

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.100
that's been building

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:43.800
a lot for us.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.680
Yeah,

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.420
it is an interesting

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.240
aspect of choosing

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.960
what platform

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.800
you want to work with,

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.040
right?

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.820
Because if it's closed source,

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:53.700
it might be great,

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.280
but you're stuck

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:54.860
with whatever you're

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:55.280
going to get,

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.180
right?

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:56.600
Maybe,

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.580
fingers crossed,

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.200
something comes,

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:58.580
but you know,

00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.120
no promises,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.280
right?

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.560
But if it's relatively small,

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.460
like a component

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.000
or something,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:04.760
yeah,

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.020
then people can add

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:06.360
their own

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.400
and that's pretty cool.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.680
Yeah,

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.480
that's pretty much

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:09.880
like the,

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.980
whenever I'm like

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.500
evaluating like tools

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.180
to bring into our tech stack,

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.280
especially for go-to-market,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.960
one of the first things

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.980
I look at is like,

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.980
it's like open source

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.980
and then their docs

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.780
and like they have an API.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.420
Like those are like

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.240
my first three

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.480
like top tier criteria.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.420
That way,

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.080
we're not like

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.100
constrained in the future

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.220
if the company decides

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:28.660
to pivot

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:29.440
or to change

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:29.820
their roadmap

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.480
and things.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.880
Right,

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.420
absolutely.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.160
So,

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:33.940
yeah,

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:34.240
pivot,

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.020
it definitely could

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:35.900
turn out bad

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.040
if it's your platform,

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:37.380
right?

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.200
So,

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.560
Apache 2 license,

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.760
tell me what,

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.400
what does that mean

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.100
for people who want

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:43.700
to go and build stuff

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:44.020
with us?

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.340
Apache 2,

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.340
so basically

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.100
we wanted to make it

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.300
as permissive as possible.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:48.680
So,

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.940
I think the gist of it

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:51.720
is you can kind of

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.360
use it for anything

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:52.720
you want,

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.060
paid,

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:53.500
commercial,

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.000
open source,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.820
whatever it is.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.640
The only restriction,

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.480
as far as I understand,

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.220
I'm not an expert,

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:58.740
by the way,

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.360
so maybe anyone looking

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:00.780
into it,

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.240
consult the license themselves.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.340
But I think it's just

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:03.760
you have to like

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.620
attribute trademarks

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.120
if you're,

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.440
you know,

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.540
copying the code with it.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.600
But we really wanted

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.200
to make it super permissive,

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:09.500
you know,

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.020
like let anyone use it

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.260
and then build

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.580
products on top of it,

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.200
like our hosting,

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:14.520
like,

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:14.900
you know,

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.280
more premium components,

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.240
like built-in auth

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.540
that will provide value

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.140
for people that are using it

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:20.440
in a,

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:20.600
say,

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.580
a business or more,

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.440
you know,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.300
production use case.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.140
So the core open source,

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:25.960
it's really important.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.660
Like anyone who wants

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.120
to build anything,

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:27.940
like we want to give them

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:28.960
something to start building.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.540
All right.

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.460
And so it's always

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.340
interesting to me

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.620
on one hand

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.280
we have a business

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.120
and employees.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.560
Two,

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.660
we're giving away

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.060
our thing.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.260
that turns out

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:41.840
to be a pretty good

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:42.840
business model these days,

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.900
but it is a little bit,

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.580
you know,

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:44.720
like,

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:44.860
well,

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.680
how does that work?

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.200
And I think

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.760
what you all are offering

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.640
is pretty helpful.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.180
Basically,

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.300
the real,

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.060
in addition to the core product,

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:53.300
right,

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.600
the real reason

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.600
which you can go

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.160
and sign up

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.200
at Reflex.dev

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.280
is take away

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.080
the trouble

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.440
of hosting this,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.540
upgrading it,

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.380
maintaining it,

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.480
patching it,

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.820
just push a button

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.280
or a CLI command

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.840
and then your thing lives,

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.060
right?

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.160
Exactly,

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:10.440
yeah.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.220
We want to simplify

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.320
the process of hosting

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.120
because once you build

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:13.400
your app,

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.040
you end up having

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:14.940
to host it anyways.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.300
And there's a lot

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.020
of clouds out there,

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:18.220
right,

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.500
and we have self-hosting guides

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.520
so anyone that wants

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.820
to can do that themselves.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.680
But a lot of these clouds,

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.440
they're configured

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.760
to host any type of app,

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.040
right,

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.980
which is really great

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.380
for the cloud

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.360
because they can host anything.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.680
But for the user,

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.680
it means it ends up

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.680
being a lot of configuration,

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.440
a lot of setup,

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.260
and a lot of overhead

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:34.980
when they just want

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.560
to get their app

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.180
and share it

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:36.860
with someone.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.420
So one part

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.360
of what we're doing

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.080
with our hosting service

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:40.600
is one,

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.380
making the UX

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.240
around it really nice.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.320
So just a simple

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:43.920
deploy command,

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.980
your app is up and running.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.100
The second is

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:46.640
we're really able

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.860
to optimize our hosting

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.960
around Reflex apps

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.260
since it's the only type

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.180
of app that we host.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.100
We can really optimize,

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.300
you know,

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:52.800
the performance,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.360
the cost,

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.620
and all these other factors

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.020
as well as add a lot

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:56.900
of stuff on top of it.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:57.440
For example,

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.360
in the future,

00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:58.940
like analytics

00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:59.660
and different stuff

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.200
on your app

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.620
where that's another add-on

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.220
if you're using,

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:02.400
you know,

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.140
a third-party hosting.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.040
So there's a lot

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.380
of, you know,

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.580
plugins on the open source

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.060
side,

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.000
but there's also,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.520
once you've hosted

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:08.920
your apps,

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.160
a lot of things

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:10.780
you end up having

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.340
to add in terms

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:11.980
of like analytics,

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:12.440
tracking,

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.000
monitoring,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.520
et cetera.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.840
And we have unification

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.340
on the kind of framework level,

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.520
but also we're going

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.380
to have it on the cloud level

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.500
where every part

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.260
of the framework

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.080
and from the front

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:23.800
and back into the hosting

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.240
kind of knows

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:24.760
about each other.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.560
Yeah.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.240
So you can probably

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.080
get some big machines

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.120
and have a multi-tenant database

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.700
with good performance,

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.500
stuff like that.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.960
Yeah, exactly.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.720
And a big part of,

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.080
like there's kind of

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.100
two aspects to our hosting.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.500
One is a public cloud,

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.020
and you can think

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:40.520
of that similar

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.840
to Vercel for Python.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.660
So that's more geared

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.360
to say hobbyist startups,

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.600
people that want

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.180
to build their ideas

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.620
shared with the public community.

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.760
And another big use case,

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.320
which is where

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.040
a lot of our app developers

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.560
come from,

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.280
is the internal app use case.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.080
Sure.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.520
And so that's kind

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.360
of another aspect

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.540
where we're building tools

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.300
to easily deploy

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.380
to our internal cloud,

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.060
monitor who's accessing

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:06.720
your apps, et cetera.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.560
Okay.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.920
Yeah, I saw that

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.860
over on Reflex.dev.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.640
if you go to pricing,

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.660
it's basically free

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.260
for hobbyists,

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.500
coming soon for pro.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.720
Yeah.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.220
You don't have anything

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.080
to announce yet, do you?

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.820
Yeah.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.280
Basically,

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.320
we're working on

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.720
our pro hosting service.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.260
So right now,

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:25.920
we have a hobby,

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.140
so anyone can kind of deploy

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:27.940
a few apps for free.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.340
But our pro is going

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:29.920
to have features

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.880
like custom domains,

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.320
ability to configure

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:32.960
your machines,

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.780
multi-region,

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.280
and make it actually like-

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.240
Let's Encryb, probably.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.040
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:37.680
SSL, all that.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.980
So actually making it kind of,

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.520
you know,

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.320
able to serve more users.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.440
Yeah, nice.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.620
I'm pretty fascinated

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.140
by the idea

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.360
that it's FastAPI

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.040
in the back end.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.160
Because I'm always concerned

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:49.660
that these things

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.380
just don't scale.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.260
Like, you're going to build it

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:51.800
and it's awesome

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.600
for 100 people,

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.180
but then if it ever

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:55.880
becomes popular,

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.760
then it's a bad idea.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.100
You know,

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.220
it just doesn't take it.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.620
That's a big reason also

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.620
why we built our website

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:01.700
as this is kind of

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.520
the leading edge,

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.640
cutting edge Reflex app.

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:04.340
Like, hopefully,

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.980
in terms of features

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.880
and number of traffic,

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.260
like,

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.780
it's tested our framework

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:09.640
a lot in terms

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.240
of like improvements.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.040
I'm sure that it has.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:13.320
All right.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.860
Let's talk for a moment,

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.480
for a few moments maybe,

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.700
about what the programming

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.480
model looks like.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.560
Just keep in mind,

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.860
most people listening

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.520
can't see what

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.080
we're talking about,

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.360
but nonetheless,

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.420
let's just give people

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.720
a sense of what it's like

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.100
to write code in this, okay?

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.240
So if you go to

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.000
Reflex.dev

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:31.860
and scroll down,

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.020
like, just have a page

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:33.260
or something,

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:33.880
there's a little

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.120
tab thing

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.020
across the top here

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.160
that has

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.580
how do you create a form,

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.900
how do you create a chatbot,

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.080
how do you create

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.260
an image gen,

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:44.980
and, you know,

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.080
this thing's pretty cool.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:46.340
It says,

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:46.940
what do you want to see?

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.100
And all this stuff is live, right?

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:48.660
So I could write here

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:48.920
and type,

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.620
I want to see a bunny.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:53.080
And within just a moment,

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:53.700
boom,

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.340
there's a bunny

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.040
running on,

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.440
what was it?

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.380
I don't remember

00:39:59.380 --> 00:39:59.860
where I saw it.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.880
Running on Flux, right?

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.360
Yeah.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.840
Yeah, Flux,

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.240
here it is.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.580
Fluxchnell.

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.220
Fast.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.000
The fast version.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.860
It's very fast.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.040
So it's pretty fast

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:10.760
compared to,

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.320
I was playing

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.260
with Mid Journey yesterday

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:12.820
and, you know,

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.940
that took a while

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.000
than a lot of 500 errors

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:15.860
and it took a while longer

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.340
than eventually

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.320
I got a picture out of it.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.600
It was pretty cool.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.400
You got charts

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.740
and so on.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:23.940
let's maybe just talk

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:24.420
about this,

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:24.960
you know,

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.000
little,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
send us a message,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:27.740
put your name,

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:28.120
email,

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:28.880
and message.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.180
What does it look like

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:30.900
to code up

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:31.960
one of these things?

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.000
Yeah,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.220
so basically

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.600
in all these examples

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.020
you show,

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:36.880
the code on the right

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.080
is the entire code needed.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:38.880
So it all fits

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.660
in one file.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:39.840
Like,

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.840
there's no extra stuff

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.720
you need beyond that.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:42.420
so if you were to copy

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.540
that and run it

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:43.960
in an app,

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.800
it would actually run.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.320
And the,

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:46.480
yeah,

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.120
just to give people

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:47.640
listening to this

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.400
and there's probably

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.740
50 lines,

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:51.620
45 lines,

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.120
something like that

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:52.480
of code.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.240
Yeah,

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:53.520
okay.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.880
And so one thing

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.780
you'll notice is

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.340
it's all in one language

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.020
and in this case

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:58.800
even one file.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.660
So it doesn't have

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.280
to be in one file.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:00.500
Like,

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.460
you can have multi-page,

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:01.780
et cetera,

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.360
reflex apps.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.720
But the kind of nice part

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.440
is the front end

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.000
and back end

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:05.700
can live together

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.760
in one repository.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:08.600
And so normally,

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.440
you know,

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.060
people that have written

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:10.480
front end,

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.160
they're probably used

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:11.760
to either writing

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.100
React HTML tags

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.820
or, you know,

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:14.700
templating through

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.080
Jinja,

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:15.540
et cetera.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.500
And what we kind of

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.160
do different

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.160
in reflex

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.200
is we define

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:20.980
your front end

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.640
as nothing but

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:22.440
Python functions.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.820
So it fits in

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:24.740
exactly with

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:25.780
all the Python syntax.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.340
You don't have to

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:26.780
kind of learn

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.260
a new language there.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.460
Everything is a Python

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:29.780
function.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:30.460
So for example,

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.280
normally when you

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:31.900
have a button,

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.100
rather than writing

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.400
an HTML button tag,

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.420
we have built-in

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.020
components like

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.020
rx.button

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.480
which as you call it

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.320
will create a button.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.000
And the kind of

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.960
layout of the front end,

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.080
if you've ever

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:44.920
worked with React,

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.660
it's very similar

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:46.140
to React

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.280
or even HTML

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.040
in the sense that

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:48.860
you have this

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:49.680
nested tree structure

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.660
that kind of maps

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:52.380
directly to the HTML DOM.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.320
And within there,

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:54.840
you can define

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.840
all your UI components.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.620
So that kind of

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.280
is how the front end

00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:58.540
works.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.440
And once you define

00:41:59.440 --> 00:41:59.860
your UI,

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:00.900
these Python functions

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.720
compile down to

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.640
React app in the end.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.300
Now, the interesting

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.820
thing is how to make

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.960
this interactive.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.720
how do you add

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.200
state to this?

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.500
So in this example,

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.300
if you want to do a form

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.280
or in the image generation,

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.340
I really want to hook

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.260
this up with my OpenAI

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.200
or my MidJourney model

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.440
to create something.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.640
So normally in web

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:18.980
development,

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:19.960
you end up having to

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:20.580
write a front end,

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.140
a back end,

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.220
and a networking layer

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:22.920
between the two

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.760
where you set up

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.680
a FastAPI endpoint

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.620
for every single

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:27.320
action you want.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.360
Then on the front end,

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:28.840
you're going to call

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.340
that API,

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.300
get the result by,

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.060
parse it back,

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.380
and then update your UI.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:33.860
So that's the normal flow

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:34.780
of say even adding

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.400
one new feature.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.000
Like if you want

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:36.600
to add a button

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.640
that generates an image

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.180
and shows it,

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.140
it will involve

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.740
touching like multiple files,

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:41.720
going through all this stuff

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.560
and hooking it together.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.380
So one thing that we've done

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:45.460
in Reflex beyond,

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.140
you know,

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.480
bringing it to one language

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.180
is abstracting away

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:49.780
the front end,

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.440
back end networking layer.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.680
So in Reflex,

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.700
you'll never have to write

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.660
an API call.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.440
You never have to write

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.100
a post request,

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:56.820
a get request,

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.440
or any of that.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.100
All of that is done

00:42:59.100 --> 00:42:59.680
under the hood.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.520
So to set up

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.720
your kind of state

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.320
and interactive,

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.660
you can do this all

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.480
within what we call

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.460
a state class.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.820
So a state class

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.360
is just a normal Python class

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.040
and within it,

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.660
you define all the fields

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:13.240
in your state

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.500
that can change over time,

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.420
which we call vars,

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.620
as well as any event handlers

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.360
that can change the vars.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.360
So an event handler

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.080
is just a Python

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.300
like function or method.

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.020
And I think the image gen

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:27.980
is a good example of it.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:28.680
So for example,

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.540
in the image gen,

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.240
the image URL is a var

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:31.860
because it's something

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.680
that's going to change.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.060
And an event handler

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.980
would be the get image function,

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.400
which is a function

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.840
that when they hit submit

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.540
on the input,

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.100
we call it.

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.380
So in order to hook up

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:44.300
the front end and back end,

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.060
all you have to do

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.480
is hook up the UI

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.680
to the Python function.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.360
So you can say

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.480
button on click

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.840
equals state dot get image.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.240
And what this does

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:54.920
under the hood

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.700
is when you click that button,

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.580
it creates an event.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.140
it sends up

00:43:59.140 --> 00:43:59.900
through a WebSocket

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.720
to the back end.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.280
It will run your Python function

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.160
on the back end.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.420
So whether that's

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:04.860
your OpenAI,

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:05.360
your replicate,

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.120
whatever it is,

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.360
all their state

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.320
runs on the back end

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:09.800
on the server.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.780
And that's what allows us

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:11.360
to keep the state

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.080
in pure Python.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.020
So it will update

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.880
your state UI.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.600
In this case,

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.160
it's going to update

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:17.880
the image URL

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.600
and send that back.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.160
And it works

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.820
very similar to React

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:22.420
in the sense that

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:23.540
as your state updates,

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.400
the front end

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.280
updates reactively.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:27.220
Yeah,

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.520
that's super cool.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:28.980
Yeah,

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:29.520
kind of just

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.480
two-way data binding

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.940
on the values there.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.020
Exactly,

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:33.360
yeah.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.700
Yeah.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.260
All right,

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:36.940
so you just said

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.040
something interesting

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.240
that there's

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:39.920
the Next.js

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.060
React front end

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.400
and the FastAPI back end.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.980
But you didn't say

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.280
it's calling HTTP APIs.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.000
You said it's using

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.740
WebSockets.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:48.560
Yes.

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.500
What's the deal there?

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.360
Why WebSockets

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.880
and not Pydantic

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.080
over HTTP or something?

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.160
No,

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.980
it's a really good question.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.000
And I think this is,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.480
like,

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.200
and a lot of people ask us,

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:00.380
you know,

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.820
how is Reflex's performance?

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.040
Or what are the downsides

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:03.560
of Reflex?

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:03.840
Like,

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.760
what's the catch?

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.280
Because up to now,

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:05.700
we've been saying,

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:05.900
you know,

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:06.540
we can perform,

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.200
create anything you can do

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:08.580
in JavaScript,

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.860
anything you can do

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:10.360
in React.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.600
So a lot of people

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.660
are kind of asked

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:14.340
about the performance

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.460
and we kind of made

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.100
design Reflex

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.300
to be really performant

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.100
in everything we do.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.520
And the reason we use

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.140
WebSockets

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.400
is because Reflex apps,

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:23.740
especially,

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:23.940
like,

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:24.860
very stateful apps,

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.380
often need to make

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.140
a bunch of requests.

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.860
So rather than having

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.020
to reestablish

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.180
a new HTTP request

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:31.680
every time,

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.120
by keeping a WebSocket,

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:33.900
we are really able

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:34.420
to optimize

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.400
the speed of the apps.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.900
So when you create,

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.460
when you kind of send,

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.400
type your prompt,

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:41.360
say you want a bunny

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.300
and you press enter.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.140
I changed it to a fast bunny,

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:44.680
by the way,

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.720
because you said

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.820
the WebSocket was fast.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:47.780
Now we have a fast bunny.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:48.560
So when you want

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.360
that fast bunny,

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.700
it will create

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.320
a little event

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:51.980
that says,

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:52.480
hey,

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.680
this guy wants to call

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.360
get image

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.720
and he typed fast bunny.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.500
It'll take that little payload,

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.660
send it through the WebSocket

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.000
that's already been established,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.740
run the Python function

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.340
on the backend

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.100
and then send

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.680
only the state delta back.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.680
So for example,

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.880
if you have a really large app

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.860
with hundreds of pages

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:08.720
and hundreds of states,

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.000
changing this

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:10.700
is not going to say,

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:11.560
hey, front end,

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.720
this is their entire new state.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.800
We only send the diffs

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.500
and stuff back

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:15.920
over the WebSocket.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.600
So all of this

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:17.980
was done

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.120
in the name of performance

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.080
and making Reflex app

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.000
really snappy

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:21.860
for whatever you're doing.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:22.920
Oh, interesting.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.860
So in a sense,

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.060
the Python code

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:26.680
that I write,

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.920
even though there's

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.660
this React bit,

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.220
some of it still lives

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:30.920
on the backend.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.920
Yeah.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.100
And then some of it

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:33.980
gets kind of mirrored

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:34.960
to React

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.120
on the front end.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:36.520
Is that right?

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.220
Yeah.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.000
And I think this,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:38.920
this is something,

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.920
especially like

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.420
as people are learning Reflex,

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.260
like one of the things

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.760
we try to emphasize most,

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.820
which is,

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.200
though it's all in one file,

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.000
it's all in Python,

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.580
there still is

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:49.180
a distinction

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.000
between the front end

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:50.420
and backend

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:51.340
because of this fact

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.000
that the front end

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.100
compiles to Next.js app

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.080
while the backend

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:54.820
is a FastAPI.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.260
So in this case,

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:56.760
it's pretty much

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.720
all the UI code,

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.220
right,

00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.280
like what's inside

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.040
the index function.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.780
That's your Next.js react app.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.760
Your FastAPI

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.800
is pretty much your state

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.680
and your event handlers.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.000
So within there,

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.920
you can keep everything

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:08.600
in pure Python,

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.740
use anything you want.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.220
The one thing you can't,

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.080
you can't do

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:12.780
and we can't do

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.200
is compile arbitrary Python

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:14.880
to JavaScript.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.460
So that's the reason

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.460
all the event handlers

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.300
run on the server

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.160
so you can use

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:19.720
any library,

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.480
anything you want.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.220
And on the front end,

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.040
we only compile

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.300
kind of a static website.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.520
So there's no logic

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.240
that ever happens

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.160
on the front end, actually.

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.820
Yeah, okay.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.320
Just updating the bindings

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.640
and triggering events.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.200
It's like a dumb UI.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:33.580
It's like,

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.500
give me the state,

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.280
I'm going to show the state.

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.700
Okay.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:37.880
Well,

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:38.480
that's definitely

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.020
a nice bunny.

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.300
So one thing

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.260
that I think

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.680
is notable here,

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:43.420
and I've seen this

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:44.200
in other frameworks

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:44.820
as well.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:45.660
Like, for example,

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.340
I had,

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.840
PuePy

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.160
on Talk Python

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:52.520
recently,

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.160
which is also

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.620
sort of React stuff

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:56.440
on the front end.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.120
But this is a lot more,

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.620
PuePy is more

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:03.060
running,

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:03.640
I think,

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.720
React type stuff

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.780
almost in

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.720
PyScript,

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.240
I believe.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.080
which is interesting,

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:12.340
right?

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.220
But one of the things

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.300
that I think you find

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.120
with a lot of these

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.060
is the shape

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:17.840
of the code

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.520
matches the DOM

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.000
a lot of times,

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:22.340
or at least

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.740
the conceptual idea

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.340
of the hierarchy

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.300
of the UI, right?

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.300
So for example,

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:28.920
here you've got

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.780
a VStag

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:30.320
with a skeleton

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.300
with a flex,

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.560
and then

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.440
you start putting

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:33.920
forms,

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.620
and in the forms,

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.260
and all of this,

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.080
every word that I said

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:37.920
there is another level

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.620
of indentation,

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:39.120
and you indent,

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:39.800
and you get a React

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:40.220
input,

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:40.880
and a React button,

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:41.780
and you unindent

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.820
Python style,

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.680
right?

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.220
And I think

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:46.600
it makes it

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.040
pretty easy

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:47.760
to think about,

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.920
here's the code,

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:49.680
here's the UI,

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.740
because the shape

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:51.300
of the code

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.480
matches the concept,

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.820
it mirrors the UI

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:55.680
in some ways,

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:55.940
right?

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.800
And rather than

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.380
just pure,

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.620
you know,

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.720
top to bottom,

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.380
imperative,

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.300
we're just generating

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:02.880
the UI,

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:03.420
but actually,

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.880
the way it's structured,

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.160
kind of like Flutter,

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.400
it looks like

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.040
it matches it,

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:08.260
you know?

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:08.920
Yeah,

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:09.720
so I think

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.480
there's kind of

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.100
two approaches

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.080
people in this space

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:12.540
have taken

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.260
to a building.

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.280
One is imperative,

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.260
which is kind of

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:15.620
what you said,

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.020
and I think,

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:16.840
for example,

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.840
Streamlit has taken

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.360
this approach

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.620
where to do a button,

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:20.700
you would do like

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.200
ST heading,

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:21.760
ST button,

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.360
and it will implicitly,

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.060
like kind of magically

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.400
put it into its thing,

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.180
and I think it could be

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.240
good for simple stuff,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:28.920
but it's really hard

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.640
to reason about

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.760
as your thing gets larger,

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:31.740
because you have to

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.740
kind of contextualize,

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:32.940
wait,

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.120
has this been called already?

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:34.540
Like,

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.080
what order is everything going?

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:36.660
Is the button

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.380
in this group,

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:37.940
or is it outside

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:38.440
of the group?

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:38.920
Yeah,

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.800
stuff like that,

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:39.980
right?

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:40.420
Yeah,

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.760
so I think it's nice

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.280
in some sense,

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.540
but I don't think

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.400
it scales very well,

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.920
especially like conceptually,

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.000
like it's hard to kind of

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:47.620
reason about

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.960
what all you've kind of built,

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.140
so I think,

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.100
I guess going back

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:54.720
to like why it's

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.280
in this structure,

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.300
it's like this is already

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.220
kind of the natural structure,

00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:58.420
right,

00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:58.960
from HTML,

00:49:58.960 --> 00:49:59.640
from React,

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.600
and I think a lot of,

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.700
as we're going through stuff

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.680
related to API design,

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.800
we try to improve the API

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.460
where we can,

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.300
but a lot of the times

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:08.660
we realize,

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:08.860
you know,

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:09.720
the people that did it

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.660
originally had a good idea,

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.380
like,

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:12.260
and there's a reason

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:12.920
it's kind of the standard.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.940
Yeah,

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:14.640
for sure.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.120
I think it takes a little

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:17.680
getting used to,

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.260
to be honest,

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.120
to see such nested stuff,

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.060
but I do like it,

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:21.640
I think it's good.

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.580
Yeah,

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.960
and I think part of it,

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.780
I think in this example,

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:25.560
we kind of nested it

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:25.940
just to show,

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:26.120
you know,

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:26.860
it's all in one function,

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.240
but in a more practical setting,

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.040
you would break this up

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:29.940
into different components,

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.520
so similar to React,

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.340
you probably wouldn't have

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.280
a giant nested thing,

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.280
and you can think of

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:34.940
each of those things

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.260
as units that you work with.

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:36.860
Yeah.

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:37.440
Also,

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:37.640
like,

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.660
decorators help a lot

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.180
with,

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:39.560
like,

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.460
making dynamic components

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.160
on the fly

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.240
in terms of functionality.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.720
Yeah,

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:45.040
yeah.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.140
All right,

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:46.600
let's talk about

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.460
just a couple more things

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.360
while we're here.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:48.620
I got,

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.060
I want to talk about

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.060
the components,

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:52.940
and the components

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:54.700
are these building block pieces,

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:55.000
like,

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.240
maybe pick just a couple

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:56.960
you think highlights

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.940
the idea of these things

00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:58.800
and we can talk about them.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.520
Yeah,

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.260
so I guess a really big thing

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.080
people use this for

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:02.700
is kind of,

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:03.020
like,

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.060
tables and graphing,

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.160
so maybe if you go down

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.140
to the tables section,

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.200
the AG Grid one

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:09.920
might be a good one,

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:10.780
so this is actually

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:11.380
a good example

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:12.440
of a third-party component,

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.400
so you can see

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.240
we have our built-in components,

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.560
but a lot of our

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:18.460
enterprise users

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:19.860
really wanted this

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:20.560
AG Grid feature,

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.980
which is one of the most

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.220
popular kind of table libraries,

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.220
so we make it really easy.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:25.840
This is an example

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.900
of a third-party library

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.640
someone's wrapped

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.260
that you can kind of bring in,

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.480
and this is an easy way

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.700
to kind of showcase your data,

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.040
so a lot of data scientists,

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.400
et cetera,

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.160
use this library.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:35.940
It can hook up

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.240
with your data frames

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.840
and kind of show this.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.000
So this is another example

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:41.740
showcasing kind of

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:42.700
the flexibility of

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.620
you want that random react library,

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:45.960
even if it's not in Reflex,

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.240
like,

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.800
the team or external contributor

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.440
often wraps this easily,

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.500
and,

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.500
yeah,

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.220
the kind of nice part

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:53.760
about it is

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.640
it's more high-level.

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.480
It has a lot of these

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.040
built-in features

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:57.700
like pagination,

00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:58.160
searching,

00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:58.520
sorting,

00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.000
and all these,

00:51:59.000 --> 00:51:59.780
so,

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:00.400
you know,

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.860
I think it's this balance,

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:02.120
right?

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:02.360
Like,

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.080
we can give people

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:03.900
the raw components,

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:04.100
like,

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.680
you can code everything

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.280
in HTML,

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.660
you can build everything

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:08.780
from the ground up yourself,

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.100
or you can use

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.080
this kind of high-level thing,

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.000
and the nice part

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:12.520
about Reflex

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.620
is you can kind of

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.000
approach it at any level

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:15.760
that you want,

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:16.600
so it's like,

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.840
I want this nice built-in thing

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:18.900
that has sorting pagination,

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.000
here it is,

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.020
or you're like,

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:21.240
you know,

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:21.860
I'm just going to build

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:22.720
everything from the ground up.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.860
I want my own table component.

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:24.860
We also give you

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:25.640
the tools to do that,

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.640
so I think it just kind of

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.320
shows the scale

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.100
at which you can kind of

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.560
pick your level of abstraction

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.980
as you're using it.

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:34.020
Yeah,

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.680
then you just pip install

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.140
the name of the thing,

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.040
and then just use it

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.060
like a native component,

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:41.380
right?

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.040
Exactly,

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:42.980
and it will act

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:43.360
as if,

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.900
like all other Reflex components,

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:45.800
so there's nothing like,

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.320
distinct between our components

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:47.940
and something you would

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:48.360
wrap yourself.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.340
So if I was

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:53.060
a reasonably sized company

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:54.320
with a team of,

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.820
maybe many of them

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:57.520
knowing React,

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.520
it might make sense

00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:59.440
for me to build out

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.720
an internal library

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.600
of widgets

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.660
that we use on our app

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.680
and plug in

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.140
to Reflex,

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:04.680
something like that?

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.400
Definitely,

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.700
and to that point,

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.440
like we have a whole guide

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.000
on our website

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:09.980
on wrapping React

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.180
with different examples,

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.660
and we're trying

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:13.380
to make it accessible

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.980
for Python developers,

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:16.000
so because that's

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000
our user at the end,

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:17.200
right?

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:17.820
So we wanted

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:18.860
to make it accessible

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.660
for even a non-JavaScript,

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:21.520
non-React expert

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.020
to be able

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:22.840
to wrap these components.

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.860
So we've seen

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.220
in different companies,

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.280
like I kind of mentioned

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:26.580
earlier,

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:27.540
that have their internal,

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:27.860
you know,

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:28.580
component systems

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.100
in React.

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:30.940
A Python developer

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:31.760
was easily able

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.620
to kind of wrap these

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:33.980
because we make it

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.440
super easy to wrap

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.580
as just a Python class

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.600
where you just

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:38.320
define the props.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.400
So maybe if you go

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.260
to the wrapping React

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.120
section on the left-hand side,

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.600
it's kind of at the,

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:46.080
maybe go back

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.560
to the main docs section.

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.760
But yeah,

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:50.420
we try to make it

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:50.860
really easy

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:51.540
to bring your own

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:52.340
components as well.

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.060
So whether you already

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:54.500
have one

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:55.120
or you want to make

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:55.480
your own,

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.200
so this is like

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:56.800
a spline one,

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.300
and you can see

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:57.920
all you have to do

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.100
is list all the props.

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.140
It's a Python class.

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:01.540
You kind of have

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:02.180
to just go find

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:02.720
what library,

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.620
what NPM library

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:04.000
you're using,

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000
list all the props,

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.700
and for interactive ones,

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:07.520
you may have to define that,

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.140
and then you can start

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:08.820
using it right away.

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:10.180
Nice.

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.860
So as part of your component,

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:13.580
you define just basically

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.920
the NPM thing to install

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:16.300
or whatever,

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.160
and then off it goes.

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:17.640
Yeah,

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.440
and Reflex will handle,

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.500
it'll install the component,

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:20.540
it will wrap it for you,

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:21.680
and it will compile out for you.

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.680
Yeah,

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.240
very cool.

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.200
All right,

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.020
I said three things.

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:25.880
One was components.

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.300
The other is this AI generator,

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.180
and then I want to just talk

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:29.760
about the roadmap.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.500
So let's,

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.900
I'm getting short on time here,

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.020
so let's go and talk

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.100
about this FlexGen thing.

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.720
This is build web apps

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:39.520
at the speed of thought,

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.920
create UIs with Reflex framework

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.460
with simple prompting.

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:48.240
So maybe I want a podcast hosting website

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.840
in the style of Talk Python to me.

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.960
Nice.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.380
Oh, no.

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.540
Here, let's go to this one.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:56.680
Yeah, try to refresh

00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:57.480
and run it one more time.

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.200
All right.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.960
So this is in beta.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.440
Like,

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.620
we're kind of released it

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:03.120
on our Discord,

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:03.800
and we're going to do

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.320
more releases,

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.800
but this version of it

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:06.540
is similar to,

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.060
if you've seen,

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.640
like, v0.dev from Vercel,

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.120
this is kind of,

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:11.760
I'd say,

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.380
like a version of v0 for Reflex

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:13.840
where you can,

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.640
it's a web editor,

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.720
you can enter your prompt,

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.140
it's going to live stream

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:17.700
your output.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:18.960
At the end of it,

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.040
it's going to give you the code

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.680
that you can copy into your app,

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.760
and you can start adding

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.580
a back end to it.

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.320
So I guess an important note

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.240
is this is more for,

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.320
like, your starter app,

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:27.660
right,

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:27.860
like,

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:28.520
when you're first starting

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.500
your project,

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.280
and you want to get,

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:30.480
like,

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.220
a good starting point.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.100
Yeah,

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:34.180
we'll fix that.

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.780
It made such a nice one

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:37.240
for me before.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:37.780
Let's see.

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:38.800
Anyway.

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.540
But the idea of this one

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.040
is to be kind of a web editor

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.860
to get your app kind of started

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:45.900
building out from.

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.340
And this is kind of

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:50.700
just a version of v0

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:51.240
for Python.

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.520
So this is level one

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.360
of what we're building

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:53.920
with FlexGen.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.640
But a more interesting thing

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.900
that we're developing now

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:57.280
internally

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.580
and are hoping to release

00:55:58.580 --> 00:55:59.200
in the next month

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.740
is a local version of this.

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.120
So this has no context

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:04.200
of your existing code base.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:04.940
It has no context

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:05.860
of what you're building, right?

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:06.780
So you could ask it

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.700
to build a little component.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:08.960
But a big issue

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:09.740
with v0

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:10.340
and other of these

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:10.880
web developers

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.620
is how do I actually

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:12.780
integrate this

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.740
into an existing app?

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:14.100
Like,

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:14.740
it's good at building

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:15.560
brand new stuff,

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.620
but how do I, like,

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:17.760
update an existing app?

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.220
So on this front,

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:19.680
we're building

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.960
a local AI toolbar,

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.120
which has a lot

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.800
of these agentic features

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.540
around Reflex,

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.020
but on your local.

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.300
So, for example,

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.300
the features we have there

00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:29.260
are you can click a button

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:30.160
and say,

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:30.880
when I click the button,

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.380
do this,

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:32.160
or click a text

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:32.420
and say,

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:33.180
change, like,

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:33.520
you know,

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.340
put a form under this text.

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.660
And the big idea there,

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.680
I think this is a good

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.580
first start,

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:41.880
but I think in the long run,

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.420
I see the toolbar

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:44.300
as being this way

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.800
where the AI

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:46.540
and the developer

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:47.620
kind of integrate together

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.360
with Python

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.420
as the common language.

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.100
So for crazy stuff

00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:51.620
that you don't want

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.020
to deal with,

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:52.820
like make a form

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:53.960
that works in mobile view,

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:54.340
et cetera,

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.580
the AI can handle

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:56.200
a lot of this,

00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.960
but once it outputs,

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.460
it outputs code

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:01.080
that you can actually

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.140
go understand and read.

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:02.880
Like, it's not this

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.820
obfuscated JavaScript

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.500
or React code.

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:05.380
It's code that you can

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.160
go edit by hand

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:06.580
if you want.

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:07.560
And you can easily

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:08.420
hook up your own state

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.240
and data to it, right?

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.240
Which is a big other thing

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.320
I think other frameworks

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:11.980
miss, which is,

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.260
here's a great dashboard.

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.540
Great, but it's all fake data.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:15.220
Like, how do I actually

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.560
make it hook up

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.200
with my clicks,

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.600
hook up with my different data?

00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.380
So that's a big part

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.440
of what we're trying

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:21.700
to bring

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.580
to the local environment.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.160
Yeah, that's cool.

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.180
And so this thing

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:26.280
will generate a visual

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:28.020
look and feel thing

00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:28.420
and you actually

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:29.080
go show the code.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:29.320
It's all fake data.

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.820
Yeah, yeah, of course.

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:31.960
And then you can show the code

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.560
and then right now

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.540
you can kind of copy the code

00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:35.500
and start using it

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.100
in Reflex.

00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.840
And then with the toolbar,

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:38.540
you'll then be able

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.780
to make incremental upgrades

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:40.500
on top of this

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:41.120
rather than starting

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:41.620
from scratch.

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:43.300
And that will have

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:43.900
like full context.

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.640
And on top of that,

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.620
we're aiming to build

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:46.840
a lot of stuff

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.020
on top

00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.780
beyond, you know,

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:50.480
just prompting

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:50.980
and updating.

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:51.620
Like there's a lot

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:52.120
of improvements

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.080
that we want to build

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.240
on top of that as well.

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.520
Yeah, cool.

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.840
All right, well,

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.400
this is pretty neat.

00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.060
I like it.

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:00.200
It definitely gives you

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.220
some ideas for

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.340
here's some possible layouts

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.040
and so on

00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.200
and gives you

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.220
at least a little bit

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:06.620
of an idea

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:07.400
of what you might want

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.080
to do and take it

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:08.560
and run with it.

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.360
So that's helpful.

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.680
Yeah, I think some ideas

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.500
we have in the future

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:12.240
for the local

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:12.760
are, you know,

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.580
buttons that can,

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:13.980
you know,

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.220
keep your same content,

00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:16.260
show you different variations

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:17.160
like auto-style it,

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:17.480
et cetera.

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.660
Like a lot of stuff

00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:19.380
that people don't want

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:19.760
to deal with,

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:20.100
but they're like,

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.040
just give me some ideas

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.240
and how it could look

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.660
and turn people more

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:24.460
into like, you know,

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.480
prompters and selectors

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.480
rather than implementers.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.340
Yeah, cool.

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.300
All right,

00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.220
let's close it out

00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:30.600
with the roadmap.

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.060
Where are we going?

00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.160
Awesome.

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.560
So recently

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.580
we just released

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.920
Reflex 0.6

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.880
last month

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:39.560
and right now

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.440
we're going after 0.7.

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.100
So a big part

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:42.880
of 0.7

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.580
is cleaning up

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.300
a lot of our

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.060
core components

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:46.460
that we have,

00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:47.780
especially for the

00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:48.980
features people use

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:49.360
the most.

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.820
So the ones

00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:51.440
we're starting off

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.000
with are,

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.660
like you can see here,

00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:54.440
AG grid support,

00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.160
which is a big thing

00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:55.620
people asked,

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:56.280
and beyond that,

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.820
just like very good support

00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:58.780
with tables,

00:58:58.780 --> 00:58:59.340
databases,

00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:00.780
and graphing

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:01.780
to help a lot

00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:02.780
of these internal apps

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:03.340
and data science

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:03.820
use cases.

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.560
Beyond that,

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.420
like one really

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:07.220
important thing

00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:08.120
for web frameworks

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:08.500
that we're trying

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.580
to build is auth,

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:10.480
so built-in auth.

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.300
So if anyone's

00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:12.880
ever used Django,

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.400
you know,

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:13.860
they have a really

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:14.860
great kind of way

00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:15.480
that you can plug

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.560
any auth system in,

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.900
and that's often

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.840
the first thing

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:19.340
someone wants

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:20.320
in a practical web app,

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:20.480
right?

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:20.700
They're like,

00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:20.980
I have,

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:21.980
especially a data app,

00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.980
they're like,

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:23.640
I have this great app,

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.300
but I don't want anyone

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.480
to be able to access it,

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.640
and we already have

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:27.380
integrations

00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:28.780
with third-party auth providers,

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:30.040
but we want to bring

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:30.700
in just like

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:31.840
first-party auth

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:32.340
where you can just

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:33.060
add a click of a button,

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.020
your website is going

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:34.440
to have auth

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:35.000
at this point.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.860
A lot of these,

00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:38.000
the other stuff here

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:38.480
is really

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.760
related to a lot

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:40.740
of performance improvements

00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:41.480
that we're going to make,

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.040
so one key feature

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:44.460
of Reflex

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.460
is the development experience,

00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:47.380
so one part of that

00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:47.760
is code,

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.380
but the other part

00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.240
is things like

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.200
hot reload

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.160
and how fast is it

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:51.860
for me to actually

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:52.520
make iterations

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:53.460
on what I'm doing,

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.780
so a lot of these

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:55.440
other tickets

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.460
are internal changes

00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:57.080
we're going to do

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.300
to make it easier

00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.120
for pretty much

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.340
improve the hot reload times,

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.440
so we wanted people

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.080
to improve their

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.060
iteration speed a lot.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.180
A lot of time,

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.120
people,

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:06.900
like pretty much

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:07.460
all their time

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:07.960
should be spent

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.900
looking at actions

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:09.240
and coding

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:09.760
and not waiting

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.280
for anything.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.560
And then one final thing

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.260
related to kind of

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:15.480
how we want to simplify

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.020
the approach

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.060
of UI and state

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.680
is we're implementing

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.840
a system called CSR,

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.020
which is kind of,

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:22.860
right now,

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:23.700
I kind of mentioned

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.640
there's this difference

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.580
between compile time

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.160
and run time,

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.660
and there's certain things,

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:28.800
your entire UI

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.560
kind of needs to be

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.780
known at compile time,

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.000
so you have to compile

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:32.420
your code,

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.300
and that's what you get

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:33.840
at run time.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.280
And what we're

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.020
introducing is

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.300
this idea of dynamic

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:37.820
components,

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:38.800
which are dynamics

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.100
generated at run time,

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.640
so this will enable

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.600
really cool use cases.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.600
For example,

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.600
you can have a chat bot

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.660
that instead of just

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:46.640
returning text all the time,

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.600
it could return components,

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.620
so it could return a graph,

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:49.200
it could return

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.660
a whole Reflex page,

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.620
and these could be

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.280
components that

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.260
you don't know up front

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.340
and are actually generated

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.020
during run time,

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.520
so it's going to help a lot

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.620
in terms of flexibility

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.180
and also in terms of,

01:00:59.180 --> 01:00:59.820
you know,

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:00.520
the ease of use

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.340
in using Reflex,

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.820
because since they're

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.060
generated at run time,

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.180
you can now use pure Python.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.320
You don't have any limitations,

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.060
and there's a lot of advantages

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.480
on the developer side as well.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.800
Yeah, that's very cool.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.500
So, yeah,

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.320
this is on the open source,

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.080
and we're also,

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.180
like I mentioned,

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.280
releasing some of our AI features,

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.920
and the biggest thing, though,

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.080
is we're releasing our first version

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:21.860
of our hosting service.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:22.560
Our hosting service

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.140
has been in beta

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:24.080
for some time right now,

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.820
but along with all this,

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.100
we're releasing our first

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:27.900
kind of paid version

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:28.860
of our hosting service,

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.720
and, yeah,

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.800
getting people on apps

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.220
onboarded onto there

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:34.360
is coming up,

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.260
so I'm really excited for that.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.100
Yeah.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.820
Well, it looks good.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.700
The web app framework

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.540
looks really nice,

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.880
so I'm sure it'll help

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.340
a lot of people.

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.780
Awesome.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.560
Yeah.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.260
Yeah.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.220
All right, guys.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.320
One final parting thought

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.140
from each of you.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.920
You want to go?

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.700
Yeah, I can go.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.700
I think one of the fun things

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.420
that I've experienced

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:57.160
with working here

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.300
is that even when I'm

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.380
writing our docs,

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.180
some people have never

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.540
interfaced with props before,

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.480
and so Reflex, in a way,

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.280
is like a bridge

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.000
to the web ecosystem.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.220
So it's been fun

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:10.660
thinking about

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.840
what are the mental models

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.360
that I can take in Python

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.140
to help explain things

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:16.980
that are in web,

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:17.820
and it's like,

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.060
how can you bring those in

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.340
and then create pathways?

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:21.960
Yeah, there's not a lot

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.760
of event-driven stuff

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.840
in Python,

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.120
but so much of the web

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:27.760
is event-driven.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:27.980
Yeah.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.160
It's callbacks and stuff.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:29.360
Yeah.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.460
I guess for me,

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:32.860
I think I'm just excited

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:33.840
about thinking about

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.800
new kind of user interfaces,

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.880
both in terms of

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.720
coding APIs

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.900
and actual user interfaces

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.960
that people are going

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.920
to be able to build upcoming.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.460
I think the current

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.100
web frameworks,

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.480
the Djangoes and Flask,

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.380
they've been around

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.040
for a long time,

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:47.600
and I think they have

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.340
a lot of great stuff,

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:48.860
but there's also

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:49.680
a lot of new stuff

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.020
that I think a next generation

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:51.580
of web frameworks

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:52.680
could add

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.020
to accelerate a lot of work,

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.240
and I'm just excited

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.060
about thinking of

01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.180
what are those features,

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.140
like how can we accelerate

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.400
while keeping the good stuff

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.120
that's already been

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.460
discovered before,

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.520
and yeah,

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:05.000
I think there's,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:05.680
especially now,

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.320
a lot more people

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:08.840
are building,

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.500
a lot more people

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.640
are becoming builders

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.140
and sharing,

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.240
so I'm excited

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:12.820
about empowering

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:13.560
all those people.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.740
Yeah, absolutely.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.720
There's a lot of abstractions

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720
to think through

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.400
in terms of

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:23.200
how can we create guarantees

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.040
that can enable someone

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:25.780
to be successful

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.480
in the long term,

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.480
especially when it comes

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.220
to building apps

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.460
that can serve

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.040
hopefully millions of people

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:31.960
and millions of traffic,

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.780
but then also being flexible enough

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.600
that they can still start easily.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.680
Yeah, that's a challenge,

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.440
and there's a lot of places

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.440
that are struggling

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.520
with those challenges

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.960
or trying to solve them.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.720
look at AWS.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.240
Just go to the services

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.880
tab of AWS, right?

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.580
That place serves tons of people,

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.100
but boy,

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.440
is it complicated

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.880
to look at the 100

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:57.660
or whatever services

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.740
and decide what you need

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.900
and how they go together, right?

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:01.360
Yeah.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.440
Yeah.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.700
We have system initiative

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.260
now, though,

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:05.340
so that's going to be

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.980
huge value add.

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.700
Yeah, I think in one way,

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.480
I think we're on an effort

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.040
to just simplify this whole thing

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.220
and just make it really easy

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:15.060
for more people to build.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.280
Yeah, it's a good mission.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:16.700
All right.

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.880
Nikhil, Elvis,

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.580
thanks for being on the show.

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:20.600
Talk to you guys later.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.540
Thanks so much.

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.240
Bye.

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:22.860
Bye.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:22.980
Peace.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.980
Thank you.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:26.120
Thank you.
