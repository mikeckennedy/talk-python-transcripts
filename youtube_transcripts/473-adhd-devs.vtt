00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.000
Chris, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
>> Michael, thank you so much for having me.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's great to be here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
>> Yeah, I'm really looking forward to talking about this kind of meta-developer topic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We're both developers and course creators and things like that, but there's a whole mental side, focus side, flow side of programming that's honestly both important and kind of interesting.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If you get it right, it makes a big difference.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
>> Yeah, for sure, for sure.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
>> So looking forward to talking to you about that stuff and everything else.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But before we jump in, though, maybe tell the world who you are.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Introduce yourself just a bit.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
>> I'm Michael.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm a software engineer.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
For the last decade or so, I have been focused on building all things front end.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Early in my career, I felt like I couldn't get anything done.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But since then, I have discovered a whole bunch of systems and strategies that have let me turn my ADHD from sometimes a liability into occasionally a superpower.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So I'm going to give you a couple of tips and tricks for doing that.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
When I'm not talking about ADHD, I'm creating courses and workshops.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I publish a couple of daily newsletters, speak at events, and I work with some really cool clients.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
>> Fantastic.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And you say you're a web developer.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
>> I'm a web developer, and I'm a programmer.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I'm a web developer and I work with JavaScript.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I occasionally reluctantly dabble in the back end, primarily PHP because I learned web development through WordPress.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Although as we were talking about pre-show, I actually had the opportunity recently to work on a project for NASA of all places, which was really cool.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Where Python was the back end, and I was tying into some back end APIs with some JavaScript stuff, which was really fun.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Really great to work with, super performant.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It was a real joy to work with.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
>> That's fantastic.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I recently had an experience with that, maybe a year ago, with Lauren, the guy who built our mobile apps.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
That was all in Flutter, and it was lots of back and forth.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It was one of the things where I knew a little bit about the back end, and the back end guy knew a little bit about the front end.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So we could talk to each other, but we were not experts at each other's thing.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
>> That sounds familiar.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So front end stuff, you've got frameworks that you work with.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
>> Yeah, I think that feels a little strong.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Earlier in my career, I was anti-framework.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
These days, I am, I'd say, framework reluctant.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So a big part of what I advocate for folks is that on the front end, there's a simpler, easier way to build things often that involves just using what the browser gives you out of the box.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And a big part of that for me is that if you're a back end person, while the tools you choose do matter, your front end, you can do it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
>> Sure, unless it's really slow or something.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But as long as it runs faster, they don't care.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
>> Exactly.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But on the front end, every kilobyte that gets shipped is a kilobyte the user has to download, the browser has to parse.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And the front end is just such an unpredictable and unforgiving environment.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
>> Unpredictable is the word.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
>> Right, yeah.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
You really don't know what you're going to get.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So I try to advocate for what I think is maybe a little bit more simple or resilient way of building things for the browser.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And yeah, I guess a little bit of a dinosaur in that regard.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
>> I'm curious about ADHD front end stuff.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I feel like generally JavaScript front end stuff makes me feel like I have ADHD just from the, "No, now this. Stop it. Now this."

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Like, "Oh my gosh, I can't focus."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
>> The velocity of change.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And not just change, because it's great that new stuff's coming out.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But the loss of the people who use the tools is really jarring.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Where a thing that is the right way to do something today is considered obsolete six to 12 months from now.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
That can get really frustrating.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
As someone with ADHD, I think it's a big part of why ignoring a lot of that stuff is so appealing to me.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Because when you focus on web standards, even though new stuff comes out, the old stuff continues to work just fine.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And you don't have to throw out a whole mountain's worth of knowledge every 12 months.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So that's been really helpful as well.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
>> Obviously, I know the term ADHD. I know kind of what it means.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I don't have a real good sense for, in reality, what it is to be a person with ADHD rather than just, "It's hard to focus sometimes."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Or your thoughts wander or something.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
But let's go with that.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
>> Yeah, I'm sure that it is. So let's start there.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
>> ADHD is actually a really terrible name for what it is.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
But people with ADHD don't actually have a deficit of attention.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
It was coined that way in the '80s when the term was coined.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Because the most stereotypical ADHD person was really hyperactive and kind of all over the place.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And poorly focused on things.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
But it's actually an executive functioning disorder.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And one of its hallmark features is that you have trouble regulating your attention.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And you can't focus on any of them.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Other times, it causes this other phenomenon called hyperfocus.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Which is a little bit like if you go into the zone as a developer.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Except way more intense.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And you can't usually control what you're hyperfocused on.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So I've got all these important things to do.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But I can't stop Googling stuff about RVs and campers.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Because that's currently what I'm really obsessed with.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And my brain won't let me think of anything else.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
There's a whole bunch of other things that can be around ADHD.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
As it has all of them.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Everybody's ADHD experience is a little bit different.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
But it can include things like having more severe emotional responses to things than someone neurotypical might.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So along with that, there's this other thing called RSD.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Rejection sensitivity dysphoria.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Which is something that you will take much more deeply and personally than a neurotypical person might.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Usually in a way that is out of scope for the actual size of the thing that happened to you.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And these are things I didn't learn about some of this stuff until in the last few years.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And it really like...

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I knew I had ADHD since I was a kid.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And then four or five years ago I started hearing more about some of the newer research.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And discovered all of these things that I thought were just weird personal failings about me were actually ADHD related.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Another one is time blindness.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So ADHD folks often just literally cannot perceive time accurately.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So sometimes it feels like it's going by really fast.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And sometimes it's usually not.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
It doesn't feel like it actually is.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And I know everybody experiences that to some degree.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But for ADHD folks it is much more often usually all the time.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
You can imagine if you work in a situation where you need to make accurate estimates on things.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
There's three subtypes.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Inattentive, which is exactly what it sounds like where you have trouble kind of regulating your focus.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The other one is hyperactive.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And that's actually... So the impulsive variant is what used to be called ADD way back in the day.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Now it's just all ADHD with three different kind of variants.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
That often doesn't often appear without also having that inattentive,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I can't regulate my attention bit.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And so many, many people have what's called combined subtype, which is where you're hyper and you have trouble regulating your focus.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I'm blessed with that kind.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
The inattentive variant is far... I'm rambling and I'm sorry. It's one of my superpowers.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The inattentive variant is both more common in women and far more underdiagnosed

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
because it doesn't show up with the hyperactivity and so it's way less obvious.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And so historically they thought ADHD was primarily like a guy thing.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And I think it's becoming a lot more obvious that many more women have it than previously thought.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
They just don't usually get diagnosed because they don't often show the hyperactivity.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
They're not running around the classroom or something along those lines.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And you're like, "Whoa, what's going on over there?"

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
That whole thing in the 80s of like, "Oh, it's overdiagnosed. That's just boys being boys."

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
All the stuff around that.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I didn't want to say a nutshell because that was very long winded,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
but that's kind of the high level overview of what ADHD is like.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Yeah, it's fun.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Except when it's not.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
It sounds like some of those things are probably annoying when you need them to not be there.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
If times feels like it's going super slowly, but it's not.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And you're like, "Oh gosh, this hour is utterly dragging on."

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
But you can also use it for the powers of good, right?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
One thing I forgot to mention, one of the root biological aspects of ADHD

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
is that our brains don't produce as much dopamine as they should.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And so a majority of the symptoms associated with it are related to a dopamine shortage.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I recently learned that your brain's ability to perceive time

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
is actually related to how much dopamine you have, which I thought was pretty wild.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Oh, I see. That's pretty wild.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Like a TikTok of you receiving dopamine is almost like a time flow.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Right? And so a lot of the time flies fast when you're having fun as an ADHD person,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
which is something I wouldn't normally be producing enough of,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
gets ramped up when you're excited or you're enjoying yourself.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Like a dried up desert river versus when the monsoons come, it's like raging, right?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Exactly. So there's no normal time for me.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
It's either moving very slowly or flying by, for better or worse.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I don't know how much personal experience you can bring to this really,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
but Jazzy out there asked, "Do you think Python is a good language for devs with ADHD?"

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
It's a great language to get stuff done quickly.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
It doesn't have too many symbols or distractive other bits to it.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Yeah, for sure. So I generally think Python, yes.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000
One of the things I'm finding is that ADHD folks seem overrepresented in development.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And I would agree with that.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
A lot of that has to do with the tight feedback loop you get with coding,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
where you write some code, you run it, a thing happens or it doesn't.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And you get that immediate, like it worked, it didn't kind of feedback loop,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000
which triggers the dopamine thing in your head and then causes you to really start digging into it.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
To answer Jazzy's specific question though,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
even though I teach front-end stuff over at GoMakeThings.com,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I have so many front-end students who are like, "I wanted to learn back-end language."

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I went with Python because it's really, really clear and there's a lot of like,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
"This is the correct way to do things," whereas like JavaScript,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
like anything you want to do, there's at least three different ways you could do it.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And none of them are inherently better than the other.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
There's four frameworks that came out this week to help you do it.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Right. So, yeah, so I probably, I don't have enough Python experience to like accurately say like,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
"Yes, that's the right one." But I just, I think programming in general is a,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000
it is a profession or hobby if you just want to do it for fun, that plays well to the ADHD mind.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And trigger that time is flying by really fast because I'm, if not enjoying it,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
at least very engaged in the activity.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And it can make what would feel like work for a normal person feel like a really enjoyable,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
fun thing that you can't get enough of.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
There are downsides to that too.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Like you could go through like an eight-hour like just coding bender and find that you haven't eaten,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
used the bathroom, gotten up to stretch in any way taking care of yourself

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and your body just didn't let you know.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Yeah. Well, I've had those experiences as well.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And I don't know if there's some aspect of ADHD or if it's just, I just got really focused,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
but I've certainly gotten up and I'm like, "Why is it dark? How is it dark? Gosh, I am hungry.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I'm going to have to deal with some of this stuff."

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Right. Yeah. The thing, so that hyper-focus for ADHD folks.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I heard, I had an old coworker who used to refer to that as weaponized ADHD.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:59.000
So if you can get yourself into that state often, you can be like way more productive than your peers.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
The problem is you can't always like force yourself into hyper-focus.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
There's no like, "Oh, I just flip the switch and I'm there." Right?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And so you will have periods of intense productivity.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And then you might have some periods where you're less productive than both your average

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and the average of your coworkers.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And depending on your work situation, that can lead to some uncomfortable conversations

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
where it's like, "Hey, you did really great last quarter.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And this quarter you can't seem to get anything done. What's going on?"

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Yeah. I can see that.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Do you feel like the folks with ADHD, they're more susceptible to maybe the fluctuations of those two things

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
from a sort of flow state to like, "I'm not feeling it, but I got a job.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
It's time to just grind it until I feel it again."

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Do you feel like those fluctuations are wider?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Like you're less productive when you feel it less and you're maybe even more productive when you're in the game?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So yes. And the other piece of this that's really tough is where a neurotypical person might be like,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000
"Man, I'm not feeling it today, but I'm not going to keep working here if I don't do the thing." Right?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Yeah.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And an ADHD person will go into this almost like freeze state.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Yeah. Okay.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And I think that's actually the official psychology term for it.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000
But you can stare at your screen for eight hours, just not get up, and you won't type a line of code.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
You'll just be like trying to... Just the inertia of getting started is really, really tough.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
It's like writer's block, but coding block in a mega way.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000
It is. Yeah. That's literally... It's like writer's block, except your brain just will not will your body to do what it needs to do.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Yeah. And so one of the things... So over at ADHDforthewin.com,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I've been writing a lot about my ADHD experience and kind of some tips and recommendations on how to get around a lot of this stuff.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And one of the things that I and a lot of other folks have found is that traditional productivity advice just does not work for most folks with ADHD.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000
So if you're a proponent of getting things done or some of those other systems,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
a lot of times what they'll tell you is start with your biggest task and get that done first.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000
That way it's out of the way. All right. Big tasks trigger massive overwhelm in the ADHD brain.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
If you are not already like, I cannot wait to chew this task up and spit it out because I'm so excited about it. Right.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And sometimes even then. So what I... One of the things that I wrote about recently was that I actually think folks should start with their smallest task first,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
because the most important thing is getting moving. You're almost like this big rock and you've got a lot of inertia.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And right now that inertia is telling you, stay right where you are. Once you get rolling,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
sometimes you can move yourself into the state where you become difficult to stop.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So the most important thing is just start doing something that moves you in the direction of work.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
So for me, like maybe you go for the small things, right? Because they're easy wins.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000
You get that dopamine, like prime the pump sort of. Absolutely. Exactly.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.000
So, you know, so for me, a lot of times that I start my morning off by writing my daily tech article because they're really short.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
It's one of those things where I it's like a habit for me now and it gets me.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
I'm at a desk, I'm typing and I've produced a thing and I shipped it.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
And now I can get on with the rest of my day and I'm like in work mode.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And if I have a day where I have a meeting in the morning and I don't get to do that, it will derail me for literally hours.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
That actually happened to me this morning. Actually, I had a I had like a client meeting and it was first thing in the morning.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And it was a really great meeting. It was super productive, but I didn't like ship anything.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And so then when the meeting ended, I I was like really underproductive for about two hours.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
I just kind of like kind of stuck, not able to get going again.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
OK, interesting. Yeah. Interesting. Annoying. Also very, very, very annoying. Right.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Well, it is it is super annoying. However, knowing at least awareness of that is pretty interesting.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Yeah. So this is, I guess, the next a nice segue here, Michael, is that one of the big things that I advocate for.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000
So I am. While I admit that ADHD has a lot of challenges like the one I just described, I'm also someone who is ADHD positive.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
I don't think it's like this thing I have to deal with, I guess, in a manner of speaking, it is.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
But it's not like, oh, this has ruined my life. Right.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
So a big part of here's why I can't do anything with the rest of my life. Right.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
So what was the answer? A big part of what I advocate for is working with your ADHD instead of against it.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.000
So I know that that that is a thing that happens if I feel that I'm in one of those moods where I just can't get moving.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
No amount of staring at the screen is going to change that.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:07.000
What is going to change that is doing a handful of other things that usually involve not using my brain at all.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.000
So there are a whole bunch of activities that will produce dopamine in your brain.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And that usually helps. So drinking coffee or soda or something with caffeine in it.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:33.000
The core mechanism by which most ADHD medicines work is by either making your brain make more dopamine or stopping your brain from absorbing the stuff it does make so that more of it like floats around.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Exercise, literally just getting exposure to sun.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
So I now that I am old, I've started gardening, which gets me like two for one.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
So I'll go outside. I dig some holes. I move some heavy, like literally heavy rocks around. Gets me going. I get some sun.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
I don't have to think. I'm just using my hands.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And then I come in and I will get like eight hours worth of work done in about three or four hours because I I'm now I'm ready.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:11.000
That's awesome. It's really like a big, a big part of the ADHD experience is learning to listen to your body and just step away.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Like staring at a screen is not going to help you.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Yeah. Yeah. It's not not that you're weak for stepping away.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000
It's not your persistence is not necessarily going to help you if you can't sort of reach reset a little bit.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I think that's true for a lot of people.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
For me, I don't know if it's the same thing. I'm going to say that a lot this episode.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
But for me, one of the things that I've tried to embrace that sounds familiar is inspiration.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
I find that if I'm really psyched to work on something or I'm just like, I really want to do this, I got to get it done.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
There's like a five X difference in productivity for me.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Yep. And so if I it's like I'm an adult, I should be able just to pay attention.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
It's like there's a right. No, no, it's ridiculously out of whack.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And so I can find if I can just OK, now is not the time for that.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
This afternoon might be the time for that. What else can I do?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Maybe, you know, maybe I'll go for a ride in my motorcycle for an hour in the mountains to get some sun and come back.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Sort of reset or just just grind on email or or stop.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Whatever it is, like just change that up and try to sense the inspiration or the lack thereof in my brain for some something and then try to ride that wave when I see it coming, you know?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, one of the things that you touched on a couple of times you brought up, hey, I do that, too.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.000
So the thing with ADHD is I could describe a whole range of symptoms and most people will be like, oh, that happens to me sometimes.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000
And it does, because most ADHD symptoms are things that everybody experiences sometimes.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And so kind of the difference between I have ADHD and don't have ADHD or what would lead you to have a doctor be like, yes, you have it.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:05.000
It's usually a like a measurement of like how often and how many of these things you experience on the regular.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
So when you get diagnosed, there's a whole set of questions you have to answer and the doctor adds up a bunch of numbers.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
And if you hit a high enough number, they're like, yeah, you probably have ADHD.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:24.000
I see. Yeah. Interesting. OK, so kind of like if you ask somebody, have you ever felt like down in the dumps?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Have you ever felt today is hopeless or whatever? Like almost everyone's going to have a day where they.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Today is hopeless. Crash the car, did this or whatever, but that doesn't mean you necessarily have depression. Right.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Yeah, for sure. And so the questions will be like, you know, how often do you have trouble?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
I'm just making this up. Like how often do you have trouble paying attention to something if you're not interested in it?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Right. And it's like occasionally, always, you know, like and so you'll have a bunch of those questions that are basically rewording of questions you already answered to account for like bias in yourself.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
And then you get a number. Each column has a number. The doctor adds it up.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.000
And if you hit the minimum number, you've got ADHD. Got it. I see. Yeah. Got it.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
All right. So I want to talk about that you can do, too, by the way. If anybody. Yeah.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:21.000
OK, I wonder if I have ADHD. A psych, a psychiatrist who diagnoses you will be able to prescribe you medication if that's something you're interested in.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:30.000
But if you just think you might have it as a first step, if you head over to ADHD for the win dot com slash talk Python, I have a bunch of resources.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And one of them is how do I know if I have ADHD? I got a link to that self-assessment there.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:42.000
So you can you can kind of dig in and that's awesome. Yeah. You put together some proper that way.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
You know, just proper stuff for the show that. Yeah. We're going to talk about a bunch of stuff.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
If I missed anything that we talk about, I'm going to go back and update this later. I just want to make sure folks have what they need if they're.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Yeah, that's awesome. I'll definitely put that in the show notes for folks and people can sign up for your newsletter.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
There's a lot of daily tips and we can maybe riff on those a little bit before we get to that, though.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.000
I do. You talked about meetings and I think meetings. I just saw where I can't remember where it was.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:17.000
I think it was the Atlantic dot com Atlantic, the publication. And it said something to the effect of like white collar work is just meetings now.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
I don't think that's 100 percent true with development, but, you know, it's a lot.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:29.000
And I think it's it can be a challenge. And, you know, I think it can be especially a challenge for people with ADHD.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000
One thing that I read that connected pretty well with me is Paul Graham's maker schedule manager schedule.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
I don't know if people have read this before. It's from 2009, but I think it's still probably more relevant than ever.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Please email me that program is great or terrible. I'm not trying to promote the guy or nothing.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Just I know VCs always get a lot of reactions. But this is pretty interesting saying that, like, look, there are people whose job it is to have meetings.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
And to them, they see blocks on the calendar as, well, here's another part of my job that I can do.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
And for the rest of us who are trying to write code and focus, this is a disruption.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
And you talked about how it can really derail like half a day for you. So, yeah.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Well, first of all, how's this? Are you familiar with this? And how's this idea set with you?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Yeah. So I am. If I weren't on your show, I'd probably be one of those folks emailing you about Paul.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
So I'm going to I'm going to not comment on the article specifically, but I would.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:34.000
OK, let's put it away. Yeah. But what I do related to that, I don't I don't know that I have strong feelings on like makers versus managers and whatnot.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:48.000
But what I do what I do know is that task shifting is particularly difficult for ADHD folks, largely because it's so difficult to get into that focus, period.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Like you think about a neurotypical developer gets interrupted from focus and it takes them a little bit to get back into it.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000
It is way more intense for the average person with ADHD.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:14.000
And so they create this effect that I've heard described as like a temporal dead zone where if I finish a task and I have a meeting 30 to 60 minutes from when I finish that task, I will not start another task.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Right. I just do. I know that by the time I actually get up enough, like momentum that I'm doing the task, I'm going to get interrupted.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000
And that's either going to I'm going to miss the meeting, which used to happen to me constantly, or I'm going to get annoyed that I have to stop.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
And the whole time I'm in the meeting, my brain will be fixated on the other thing and not the meeting.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
So I won't I just I won't start a task. So I've got this whole block of time that gets eaten.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:54.000
And then when the meeting ends. Now I've got this long on ramp to get shifted back into my next task after the meeting.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
So so meetings are bad for developers in general.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:07.000
They are extraordinarily bad for folks with ADHD. And one of the things I talk about is some strategies you can use to try to you can't always make it work.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:16.000
But I used to employ a ton of strategies when I had like a day job to prevent myself from getting booked in midday meetings.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
I don't mind them at the beginning of the day. I prefer them more in the afternoon when I run out of like developer steam.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000
But yeah, like a meeting at like 11 or 2 in the afternoon just just destroys my day.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Yeah, I hear you. Yeah, where I was going with that article is what I've ended up doing is I have just certain days blocked off where there's no meeting days.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.000
And that's because I have the flexibility for it. And you know, you're doing this stuff independently now, not at 9 to 5. Is that right?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Yes. But even when I was at a 9 to 5, I used to do stuff like that because you just gotta.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Depending on the culture you're in, like some places are just full of excess meetings and it becomes very necessary.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Yeah, then your job is to go to the meetings. I mean, right.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Right. I mean, there's the whole joke, right, about like this meeting could have been an email.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:19.000
I have found that some companies are worse at that than others. You know, there are some environments I've been in.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000
They're really cool about async communication. Other places like the de facto is just block time on people's calendar.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:35.000
And that is awful. I don't know where this social expectation that you could just block time on someone's calendar at any point for any reason came from.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
But it's exactly I'm going to reach out. I'm going to grab some time with you. It's like, hold on.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000
That's just open ended. Yeah, I found that article. I'll link it. White collar work is just meetings now. It's interesting.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Yeah. Blocking, blocking time, I think, is a great strategy.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
One, I guess one tangential thing here, because it's not just meetings. Right.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:07.000
It's if you're in office and you're in an open office environment, the pop in is an absolute nightmare.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:15.000
If you have ADHD, I mean, we've I'm sure you've seen before, Michael, articles about how open office environments are bad for productivity just generally.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Yeah. Again, it's one of those things worse if you have ADHD.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:33.000
If you're on a remote team, sometimes there's a culture on Slack or Discord that replicates that open office environment pop in where you're expected to just always respond quickly on those tools.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:44.000
And so there are two paths you can take. If you have ADHD and this stuff is messing with your day, you can either ask for forgiveness instead of permission and just take what you want.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:54.000
So I for a long while, I just I had this thing where I would I would just turn off Slack and I would check it like two, maybe three times a day.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:01.000
And if someone really, really needed me, my manager had my cell phone and he could call me if it was like super, super important.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Same thing with email, that kind of thing. So that's one path.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000
The other path is you can have a conversation with your manager. The laws around this vary from country to country.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:21.000
But in America specifically, where I live, the Americans with Disabilities Act requires companies to provide reasonable accommodations for disabilities.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:34.000
And ADHD actually qualifies as one. So you can say things like I need to be able to work from home or you need to give me a private office where the team lead who keeps shooting nerf darts at my head can't do that anymore.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Or that's a real story that used to used to happen in a previous employer.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:50.000
He was a bozo. Or I need to have days where I don't have meetings or it would be really great for me if more of our communication happened asynchronously.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Or if you ask me to do things, I need I need someone to follow up in writing with that or I'm going to forget.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:07.000
There's like a whole series of things you could ask for. I have a list of accommodations over at my site as well that I'll make sure ends up in the cheat sheet I put together for this episode.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:14.000
But yeah, asking your employer if you feel comfortable can be a great thing to do.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
I am at a point in my career where I feel very comfortable having those conversations.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:29.000
I bring it up with clients for the last four or five years of my working career. I brought it up with my employers, any of my managers.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:38.000
I would bring it up in job interviews, but I am a cisgendered, heterosexual, white dude with a whole lot of professional experience.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:55.000
And I have talked to more junior developers, people who are LGBTQ, people who are minorities, and they have all told me some version of I already feel like I'm under more scrutiny because of my gender, my skin color, my identity.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
And I don't want to give my employer another reason to look at my work more closely.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000
And so I'm realizing as I'm saying this, I fully acknowledge that I'm in a privileged position to be able to do that.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:17.000
But if you feel comfortable, it can, in the right culture, make your life at work a lot better and a lot easier.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Yeah, I totally agree. Do you feel like the work from home stuff has been a boon?

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:34.000
As for me, I have also talked to some ADHD folks who they feel like it doesn't have enough structure isn't the right word.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:46.000
There's a bit of an accountability that can happen when you're in the office where just seeing other people doing work means that if you are sitting at your desk and you look like you're not doing work, that's bad.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:58.000
So it gives them at least a bit of a push to start moving. And there is a technique called body doubling where you literally just sit on a live cam with someone else and co-work in silence together.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:09.000
That is supposed to address this. I find it deeply uncomfortable. I actually prefer to not do that. But I do know some ADHD folks find it helpful.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:20.000
But for me, I went remote pre-pandemic. I had been remote for a while and it had been the single best thing for my productivity that I've ever done.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Even before 2020, it was like a non-starter for me for any job I applied for after I had gone remote that I would never go to an office again.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I hear you. I've done that since 2006. And so it's just like that's how work is for me.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Yeah, absolutely. I think it was like 2009-ish for me. I was hybrid and then I went full. And it was just not without its own challenges, right?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Because if there are days where you just you're not into it, it's really easy for me to then not do anything. And that's fine every now and then.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
But if it happens too much, you can find yourself in a situation where you've got like a big backlog of work that just didn't get done. And that's bad.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000
But yeah, on the whole, I would say it's been a huge blessing.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000
It's not a problem to focus. It's not a problem. There's too many distractions. Over there is my sim racing machine.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
If I'm feeling like I can't, I just get up and go do that instead. And then eventually I do that half the day.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000
If that were how work from home worked for me, I could see that's bad.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.000
There's a negative side to work from home as well. I'm trying to stay focused and not do the dishes and whatever.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Yeah, doing dishes, being pulled to do the dishes is usually not a problem for ADHD folks.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
We usually have the other problem, which is, "Oh God, I haven't done the dishes in days."

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Why does the kitchen look like that? How'd that happen?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:53.000
I know why. I feel a deep shame about it and won't address it.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:05.000
I think the bigger challenge with work from home is if you don't have a dedicated space to do work, you can run into some of what you just described.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
You can also run into a situation where there's just a lot of other stuff around you.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:15.000
If there's other people at home, if you have a partner who also works from home, or you have kids and it's summertime and they're home.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
It can be loud, it can be noisy, it can be distracting.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:34.000
I don't find the pull of other stuff in my house that bad because I am coding on what is effectively a very expensive gaming and video streaming machine.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
It has enough distractions just on the thing I have to do work on already.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.000
There's really not much else in my house that's more appealing than the thing I'm sitting in front of to do work on.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
That's true. Nothing is as distracting as my phone or my computer already.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
They're right here with me all the time.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Yes, all the time.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
That part less so. It's more the noise.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000
If you don't have a quiet place to work, that can be challenging.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
But I don't think necessarily any more so than the office.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
It's just you're in basically the same position.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
You're in your own open office sort of deal.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
You put together a couple of tools that maybe we could talk a bit about.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
You talked about building a second brain.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
This comes from the book by Tiago Forte, I believe, which I read not too long ago.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Pretty interesting book.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
There's lots of software to accomplish this.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
And actually, Anytype is what I've moved away from Notion towards.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
It was just similar, which is super fun.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Open source.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
I haven't heard of this.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Anytype.io.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
I've heard that there's a lot of similarities.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:38:00.000
One thing we didn't talk about when we talked about symptoms of ADHD, ADHD folks usually have a very large hard drive and a very small amount of RAM.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
So we can only keep one or two things in our working memory at any particular point.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
And second brains are great for everyone.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:17.000
But if you tell me three things, there's a good chance I will have forgotten the first two by the time I get back to my desk.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:29.000
And so the idea of a second brain specifically for folks with ADHD is that it becomes the RAM that your brain doesn't have.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Got it.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Any idea that pops into your head, any task you've been given, any thought, anything that you don't want to forget 30 seconds from now needs to get written down somewhere.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
It can be paper.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
It can be digital.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Both have their pros and cons.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
I'm biased towards digital for being able to search.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
But writing things down seems to make stuff stick a little bit better in a lot of folks' heads.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Are you trying to memorize it or are you trying to store it?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Put it on digitalized.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:08.000
So I think a quick definition for folks, I mean, they can imagine what a second brain is, but give people a definition of what this means.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Yeah.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:17.000
So a second brain -- and I'm not going to -- I'm probably not going to do justice to, like, the official definition here.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:29.000
But the idea of a second brain is that it's literally just a place for you to write down or capture all the things.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
It's funny.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:40.000
I've read so many different descriptions of it, and in my head it always just brings me back to the ubiquitous capture device or UCD from getting things done parlance.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000
I think it's just like a -- in my opinion, it's just like a rebranding of that thing.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000
But the idea is you just -- you want a place to capture and write down all the things you don't want to forget later.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Yeah.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
It sounds good to me as a description.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:04.000
I think what I got from reading the book, there's a process for capturing the stuff and filtering it and putting it -- I don't know if I need any of that.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:13.000
What I need is it's in my mind and it needs to get written down in basically a place I could get back to it if I want to or even put a reminder around it.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Like you said, just get it out of RAM, swap it to disk for a while conceptually, and you can get back to it if you need, right?

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000
And the thing with -- because I know you mentioned Notion, I like Obsidian.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
There's a lot of different tools out there.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:41.000
One of the problems for ADHD folks with most digital tools is most of the tools available today do a lot.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
And that is kind of the problem.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:56.000
So I'm going to use Obsidian because I know it well, but Notion, having played with it before, is very similar in, like, capability and what it can do.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:05.000
So I look at a tool like Obsidian, which is markdown notes that you can kind of access and edit through a GUI and organize into folders and things like that.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
And it has a plugin ecosystem.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:18.000
And you will see, similar with a tool like Notion, there are consultants who specialize in teaching you how to get the most out of Notion.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:28.000
And you can build these really complicated workflows where you can tie things from a page into another page and then things show up automatically in these different views and you get these graphs.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
That all sounds really fun.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
It's amazing.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:39.000
I close this thing in my Kanban board on GitHub, which triggers a thing, which will move this into this page, and then Sarah gets a notification.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Like, oh, my goodness.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
So the thing is, that sounds fun.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
And that sounds like an interesting challenge.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
And it sounds almost like a game.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:42:02.000
If I have a brain that craves dopamine and enjoys kind of gamified experiences, I'm going to spend hours, days, weeks perfecting my to-do system to the expense of doing the actual things I need to do.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
And then down the road, I'm going to be like, oh, this is so complicated and difficult to manage.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
This isn't working for me anymore.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
I'm going to throw it away.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
I'm going to go repeat this process again with something new.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
I've talked to a lot of ADHD folks who feel like productivity systems just don't stick.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
And a big part of that is because they're overcomplicated.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:30.000
So I think the thing I found that works best for a lot of -- for me, and I've talked to a lot of folks who have had similar experiences, is simple to-do lists.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Like, everything is a bulleted list.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Even if it's, like, an idea you want to remember later, it's a bulleted list.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
It might not be a to-do that you have to check off, but it's a bullet.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:48.000
And when I use tools like Notion or Obsidian or even a paper notebook, excuse me, everything is -- everything is bullets.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
I install almost no plug-ins, no add-ons.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:58.000
The only thing I have is a My Day view where when I tag things with a unicorn emoji, they show up on My Day.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
That way I can just flag the -- and I like unicorns because they're fun.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
But it's just -- it's the place where these are the things I need to do today.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
I can see them all on one page.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
And that's it.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:20.000
I think one of the tools I've found that used to work -- still works really well for me, but is occasionally a little bit buggy now, Microsoft To-Do, which is their free to-do app.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
I like it because it does less than tools like Todoist, which does a lot.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Like, it does -- it's basically just bulleted lists with sublists under them, and you can flag stuff in this special "I'm going to do it today" page.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
And it doesn't have any of the other stuff, which makes it way less distracting.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000
>> Sure.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
>> The only reason I moved away from it is -- >> Sorry, go ahead.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
>> Oh, yeah, the only reason I moved away from it is I really like authoring in Markdown, and I wanted something that would do that.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
>> Yeah, that's why I like Notion.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
You just write Markdown, and it just becomes magic.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
You forward slash it.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.000
I'm a fan of Todoist, but I try to just not overcomplicate it, just kind of have a flow.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
>> Yeah, but it's funny.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
I say, like, oh, use Obsidian or Notion, just don't make it too complicated.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
But you could do that in Todoist, too.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
>> Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.000
>> Yeah, they're all -- whatever tool you choose, just resist the urge to over-engineer it.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
I know it's tough, but you'll be much happier in the long run.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
>> Just put the extensions down.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
>> Yeah.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
>> Another thing you gave a shout-out to is the Apple Watch, which I love my Apple Watch.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
It's increasingly -- it is a second brain for me in weird ways.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Like, for example, an hour and a half ago, I was recording a course, and I put everything on Do Not Disturb,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
and I'm like, don't forget to come do the podcast with Chris, and an hour and a half.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
So I just, hey, set a reminder for an hour and 20 minutes, and then I just -- I didn't stress.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
It just took the weight off my brain.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
I could focus back on the course, and then, oh, it's time to go.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Like, all right.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
So my wife is the reason I have an Apple Watch.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
I was very resistant because in my mind, I'm like, I don't need -- I'm already, like, too distractible.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
I don't need another thing chirping at me.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
That sounds like --

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
>> You literally are putting distractions on my arm.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
I can't get it off.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
What are you thinking here?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
>> She was like, please, just try it.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
I think it's going to be really helpful for you.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:22.000
And I did, and she was right because before I got the Apple Watch, I used to miss meetings constantly.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
I would go off on my phone, I would snooze them, and then -- or more likely, I just dismissed them by accident.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000
And then five minutes later, the meeting would start, and I wouldn't be there because I got sucked back into something else.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.000
So having that, like, right on your wrist, for some reason, is a real game changer for me.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
I set timers for literally everything.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Laundry, food that I put in the oven, anything that needs to get done gets a timer.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:59.000
And the one thing that I haven't written about yet but that has really helped is the one place where you don't usually have your second brain is in the shower.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:09.000
And I do a lot of thinking in the shower, and I have some of my best ideas, and I'll be damned if from the time I have the idea to the five minutes later when I get out and dry myself off, I have already forgotten it.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Happens all the time.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:21.000
But if you have the watch, you can just dictate a note to yourself or text yourself or do something, and then you have it, and you can, like, do stuff with it later.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:33.000
I used to have an old manager who literally had one of those, like, scuba diving chalkboards with, like, the grease pen in his shower so that he could write down ideas.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:43.000
This feels like the digital version of that to me where you just, you know, like, "Hey, Siri, write a note that says," and then you're off to the races.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Yeah, and for all the failings of Siri, that actually works pretty well.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Like, the few things like set a timer, set a reminder, like, they actually work quite well.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
You just hold the crayon and, yeah.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Honestly, now that I'm talking about these two things in parallel with you, I feel like it is sort of my second brain of, like, reminders and attention in a sense.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Well, yeah, because it literally, one of two things would always happen to me.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:16.000
I would either over fixate on the thing so that I don't miss it, or I would completely ignore the thing and miss it.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
And the Apple Watch lets me do the latter without missing the thing.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000
So I can free my brain to do other stuff, and I know I'm not going to miss my events, my important stuff.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Sure.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
And people out there who are like, "I'm not an Apple person.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Why are they?" Like, you can get a Google Wear, Android Wear, and do basically the same thing I imagine.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Well, I don't have a lot of experience with those, unfortunately, because I am very big into the Apple ecosystem.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
But I need to stop saying Apple Watch and start talking about smart watches more generally, because you're right.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.000
My biggest disappointment with the Apple Watch is that it requires an iPhone to work.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
I think that's dumb and annoying.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
It's completely dumb.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:06.000
But, yeah, if that's you, if you don't have an iPhone or you're not in the Apple ecosystem, I would look at some of the Android options,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
because I think just a smart watch in general has been a really amazing tool for me.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Probably one of the most important in my toolkit.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Yeah. It's so frustrating. I don't want to go down this road all that much.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000
But I was looking at the Nothing phones.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000
They're super interesting. They're really quite different.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
I seem to recall this from a few years ago.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Yeah, they've got some interesting different ways about, like, they've got stuff on the back that will flash and communicate things.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Are these the ones where you can swap your own?

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
No, that's framework.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:53.000
So they've got these hieroglyphics on the back that mean different things if they light up.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
I'm like, this is cool. I kind of want to play with this stuff.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
But my Apple Watch would basically be dead.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
I'm like, well, I'm going nowhere.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
I can't imagine why Apple would do that.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000
It makes no sense. It must be an oversight.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
We've got a little bit of time left, maybe 10 minutes.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
What do you think about maybe going through some of those daily tips or something like that?

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000
The idea of them, and maybe just pick a couple that you want to just give a shout out to.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Yeah, well, so one of the things -- I'm in the middle -- I said the beginning of a series on how to get stuff done when you have ADHD.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
And I'm breaking it into two parts.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000
One of them is, like, I'm calling it productivity.app, which is my approach to getting stuff done.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.000
And then the other one is hacking your brain's operating system.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:50:00.000
And the hacking your brain's operating system feels like there's potentially some interesting nuggets in there.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000
I'm looking through the list, though, and I actually think we've talked about most of them.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Nice.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Yeah, that's just organically.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Because you brought up the Apple Watch, and that would have been the one that doesn't always get brought up, but you brought it up.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Nice.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:22.000
One other thing, though, I will say, there are -- so this happened the other day I wrote about.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:36.000
But one of the -- I think one of the things I've come to realize is there are certain types of work that lend -- within the development space, which lend themselves better to the ADHD brain than others.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
And so I look at something like agency work.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Agency work can be like a blessing or a curse depending on the agency.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
And I know that's, again, generally true.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
But --

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Yeah.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Quick definition for people who are new to programming or outside of the consulting world.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Agency work, what is that?

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:10.000
So this would be like a development agency that builds some sort of thing -- could be a mobile app, could be a website, whatever it happens to be -- for a variety of different clients.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
So they have a range of clients they work with, and they get contracted, and you are a developer on that team.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:26.000
And I contrast that against being an in-house developer where you're like, "I work at IBM, and I manage all of the web properties for IBM," or "I build this app for IBM," whatever it happens to be.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Yeah, "I build the authentication integration between all our internal apps and keep them running," or whatever.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000
So this is more like -- you're like a bee floating from client to client.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Now, that can be awesome.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:52.000
If you're the right kind of agency, that means you're constantly getting variety in clients and work, so you've got novelty, and you can just absolutely crush it with that kind of work.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000
However, sometimes you have agencies that are like, "We build WordPress sites for ice cream shops.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
That's all we do.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
We know it."

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:09.000
And you get to a point where it's cookie cutter, and that is just mind-numbingly boring.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
It can be easy work.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:19.000
It can be work that you do very effectively, that you can apply unique aspects of that to each of your different clients in different ways.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000
But it can also run the danger of triggering the whole, "Oh, this is really boring.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
I can't get anything done" reflex.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:36.000
And agencies often -- I'd say 90% of the time -- are really focused on billable hours.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:44.000
So a lot of what you're doing is saying, "I think it's going to take me X amount of hours to do," and then tracking how many hours it took you to do and billing those hours.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000
And those two things are absolute nightmares for the ADHD brain.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:55.000
So if you find an agency that does flat billing where they're like, "We charge X to build you Y," awesome.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Or they do a variety of different work, can be really awesome.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
But often that's not the case.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:17.000
And so where I find that a lot of folks with ADHD really do their best work is when they are not time-constrained, and the nature of the role is more, "We've got this big, hairy challenge, and we're not really sure how to figure it out.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:24.000
We need someone who's really into problem-solving to go, like, research it and tackle it, and you happen to find the problem interesting."

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Because if it's just one of those things, you're in trouble.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:38.000
But if it's a big, hairy problem and you find it interesting and they're not like, "You have 12 hours to figure this out," that can work really, really well for you.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Yeah.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:47.000
You're riding the wave of the deep, the super-focus, the hyper-focus, and just killing it.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
It hits multiple things at once.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000
The challenge triggers the dopamine thing.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:01.000
It allows you to dig into that hyper-focus really, really deep and crush a whole bunch of work and look like an absolute rock star.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:09.000
And, yeah, it's one of those things, too, where once you get fixated on a thing, it's all you'll think about.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:16.000
And so you'll just keep pulling at that thread until you've got it figured out.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Yeah, so that can work really, really well.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Yeah, I don't know where I was going with this.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Oh, yeah, it was a thing I wrote about the other day.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
That's why.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000
We were talking about daily tips.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Sorry.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Yeah, yeah, the daily tips look pretty interesting.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Is that free to sign up for?

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Yes, yeah.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Every morning you get just a little something in your inbox.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000
I try to keep them short because, again, ADHD audience, right?

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
These are your people.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
These are my people, absolutely.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Got it.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
One of the other things that comes up a lot, too, is when you should disclose ADHD.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Like, if you think you're going to do that, when in the process should you disclose it?

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Right.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Is it your employers?

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Is it their business to even know?

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Yeah, so that's what's really important.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:11.000
I had someone ask, do I feel like it's unethical to have a neurological condition that could impact your ability to do the work and not tell them?

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:20.000
And I feel very strongly that it is not in any way a problem to do that because it's none of their damn business.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Like, if you legitimately think you're not going to be able to do the work, that's a bigger conversation.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:32.000
But if it means that sometimes you're unproductive and sometimes you're a little underproductive, it's kind of a wash.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:51.000
I don't have an issue with that, just the same way that I think someone not disclosing that they're pregnant during an interview process or they have cancer during an interview process or any other sort of medical condition that is none of your employer's business is totally fine not to disclose.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:56:09.000
So for me, my recommendation is that you either disclose once you've started the job and you have identified the areas where the current working environment creates challenges for you and you need accommodations.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Or I will sometimes disclose during an interview process if I'm really, like, digging the people I'm interviewing with and I feel like we're all vibing.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:34.000
So, like, I was once on an interview where I was asked whether my preference is to have regular check-ins with my team on Works in Progress or to go off and build for a few days and then reconnect after a few days.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Based on everything we've talked about, Michael, I'm sure you're not surprised to hear my preference is to ignore everybody for a couple days and then chat.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000
But I didn't want to seem like a jerk who doesn't like my coworkers for saying that.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000
So I was like, "Oh, I have ADHD, so blah, blah, blah."

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:57.000
And then I found out the interviewer had ADHD, the other dude on the team we were going to be working with had ADHD, the manager had ADHD, and they were all the same way.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Awesome.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000
We all agree on this.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Right?

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000
I got a job offer, like, three days later.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
It was amazing.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Yeah.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000
So, best-case scenario.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Like, you could find that Works Against You.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000
But, yeah, a lot of it is just, like, a gut vibe thing, right?

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Like, there's no right answer here.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000
You can disclose early.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
You can disclose late.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000
You can disclose not at all.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
You're under no obligation to do so.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Okay.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Let's see if we can close up this episode with maybe see if I can get some more mail.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Yeah, sure.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Scrum, Agile, paired programming.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
None of these things sound appealing to me.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000
And when Agile first came out, I thought, "Oh, this is really interesting."

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000
I find that in practice, maybe in principle it sounds cool.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
But, for me, it's all distracting.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
It's all friction and stuff.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Yep.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000
What are your thoughts?

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
I don't want to put words in your mouth.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000
I'm talking about myself.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000
So, how do you feel about these things?

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000
No, no, no.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Yeah, no.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Yes, I agree.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:07.000
I talked recently, or I wrote recently, about how stand-ups are just productivity killers

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.000
for me, depending on when they happen and how they work.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
So, my productivity is variable.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:19.000
I have days where I will do eight hours worth of work in four hours, and I'll do that twice.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
So, I'll get two or three days worth of work done in a day.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000
I'll have days where I get nothing done.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Something like a daily stand-up really plays into this idea that you are consistently productive

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000
every day.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000
And if I have two or three days where I have to at stand-up say, "Yeah, I'm still working

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000
on that thing that probably should have only taken an hour, but I can't make myself do

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
it," I look like a jerk.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000
I look like a bad employee.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Right?

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Instead of you have to show how you failed that.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Yeah.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000
And then that can create this self-esteem spiral of, "Oh, I'm really bad at this.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Everybody else is getting all this stuff done.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Maybe I don't belong here.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Imposter syndrome, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Similarly, things like two-week sprints and a lot of those rigid processes, I get why

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000
they exist.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000
I understand that they can work well in certain spaces.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000
I think it's good to have deadlines on when things are going to show some meaningful progress.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:27.000
But for the way that I work, I find that having those kind of rigid fixed deadlines creates

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000
bad stress for me and doesn't always align with when my brain is like, "Yes, we're going

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
to crank out a ton of work."

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:41.000
I personally need a little bit more flexibility than those types of systems allow.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Yeah.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000
So it's one of those, "Maybe good for other people, but not good for me," kind of things.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Yeah.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Yeah, I don't know.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000
And paired programming?

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.000
How does that fit with people's ADHD?

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000
It depends.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000
If I am having a problem with code and I am just absolutely stuck, paired programming

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
my way through it can be invaluable.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Paired programming just for the sake of paired programming is a nightmare for me because

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
it makes me feel really self-conscious about what I'm doing and how quickly my brain processes

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
information and my process.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I like paired programming with other people who need help as well, like in a mentoring

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
capacity if they're trying to work through something and they just need someone to guide

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
them, happy to do that.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Sure.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I feel a little more like mentoring.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Yeah.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
But just classic, I just generally...

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I know some organizations are really big on, "You two are going to work on this feature

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
together."

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Yes.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
That does not work for me.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I've heard people who really love it.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
They find it very valuable.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I'm not trying to take away from that.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
This is not one of those, "I think it's bad for everybody."

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
It sucks for me.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I think it sucks for a lot of folks with ADHD.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Yeah.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I just can't get in a flow if I'm sitting and working with somebody.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I might be having a good time, but it's really hard to reach that really high level of productivity.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Yeah.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Let's close this out with a bit of a joke, okay?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Maybe something practical.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:25.000
You talked about the time blindness, estimating is hard, Agile is all about estimates and

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
stuff.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I saw this pretty cool article I talked about on another podcast, Python Bytes.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Basically, hard to swallow a truth they don't tell you about software engineering, but they

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.000
have a really great cartoon in here that says, from monkeyuser.com, is actually where it's

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
originally from.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
It's trying to reimagine how you might estimate.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:50.000
It says, "For better estimates, instead of points or hours, we switched to measuring

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
story points too.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000
How many duck-sized horses you're willing to fight rather than implementing this task?"

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000
There's no duck you would fight for because it's so easy, or you'd take on a whole cavalry

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
of small duck horses?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I don't know.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
What do you think?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I know it's a joke, but I find the stake in the ground comparisons for estimates useful.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I still don't think I'll always get to an accurate place, but if I say, "I don't know

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
how long something's going to take," and someone says, "Well, do you think it would take 20

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
hours?"

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
That gives me an instant grounding of, "Oh, that feels too high, that feels too low,"

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
or just right.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
It's still, in my opinion, a bit of a wild guess.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Once you start doing the work, you will expose things like unknowns that make, "Oh, we thought

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
this, but based on this other thing, it's going to take longer, or it's going to take

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
way less, or it's going to take about what we thought."

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Having some sort of grounding, whether it's a number of hours or horse-sized ducks you'd

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
be willing to fight, I do actually think that's really useful.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
It's actually kind of interesting.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000
There's a human nature, aversion to negativity stronger than a positivity.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
And this is like, how much negativity or how much resistance do you feel to this?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I kind of think it's a little bit, maybe not idealistic, but I think it goes in the flow

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
of humanity.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
So I think it's a funny one.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:26.000
So the one caveat with this is there are tasks that have been on my to-do list for ages that

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:33.000
realistically would only take 15 to 30 minutes that I will put off for ages.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Usually they're phone call related, and I hear this a lot from fellow ADHDers, like

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
making phone calls is just really...

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I had to make an appointment with a psychiatrist to look into getting ADHD medicine on my to-do

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
list for, I am not making this up, three years.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Michael, this was a 15-minute phone call.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Three years.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Because it's not just the phone call.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It's the find a psychologist or psychiatrist you think you're going to hit it off with,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
make the phone call, pick a date to go there, get in the car, drive there, do the whole

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
like social awkward introductions thing, talk about your feelings.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Right?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Yeah.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
There's a lot of levels of resistance.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And the thing that actually got me over the hurdle, I found a psychiatrist who has like

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
a you fill out your information, we'll call you.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And that was the thing that did it for me.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Yes.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I don't have to navigate one of these.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
It's like, press three for this, now seven, now enter this.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
You entered it wrong.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
You didn't give me long enough to look it up.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So the number of like duck-sized horses I'd be willing to fight to avoid making a phone

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
call, which is actually a relatively easy task, is much higher than the number I'd be willing

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
to fight to like implement my own e-commerce platform.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
You know what I mean?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Sure.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Yeah.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I'm going to write my own crypto before I make that phone call.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Even though one is objectively way more difficult than the other.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
But it estimated, it's a reasonable estimate of the total time, not the active time.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
So there you go.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I think there's something to it.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
All right.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Chris, this has been a fun conversation and hopefully helpful for a lot of folks out there.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Let's wrap it up with a call to action.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Awesome.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
People want to learn more.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
What are you telling them?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Yeah.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
So if you want to learn more, you think you might have ADHD, you do have ADHD, head over

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.000
to adhdforthewind.com/talkpython where you can find a whole bunch of resources, my daily

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000
newsletter and my contact information if you just want to ask questions or fight me about

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Paul Graham.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Not a fight I want to have.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I would say all those links and all these things will be in people's show notes.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
So just flip over in your podcast player and you can get it right there.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Chris, thank you for being on the show.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It's been insightful.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Michael, thanks so much for having me.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
This was truly a pleasure.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Thanks.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Bye now.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.360
Yeah, thanks, bye now.
