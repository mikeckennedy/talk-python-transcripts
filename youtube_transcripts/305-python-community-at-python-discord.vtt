00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
>> Hello, everyone out there on the broadcast.


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.960
Welcome, welcome. Thank you for joining us.


00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.440
It's great to have you here. Super excited to have you watching the live stream.


00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.560
If you want to comment on stuff we're talking about,


00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.600
please put it in the live comment,


00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.840
the live chat, and we'll try to make it part of the show.


00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.560
Yeah, with that said, Leon,


00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.080
you about ready to kick this off?


00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.360
>> Yeah, let's do this.


00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.640
>> All right. Leon, welcome to Talk Python To Me.


00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.560
>> Thank you. Thanks for having me on.


00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.520
>> Yeah, it's great to have you on.


00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.560
You're doing such interesting work in the community,


00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.960
and I'm excited to just give you a chance to share what you're doing with the world.


00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.640
It's cool what's going on over at Python Discord,


00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.680
and it's a lot bigger than I think people realize.


00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.560
>> Yeah. Especially the last year,


00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.200
it's completely taken off.


00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.280
It's quadrupled in size over the last year.


00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.600
>> Wow.


00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.280
>> That's, we have 150,000 users now,


00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.800
100 members of staff,


00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.920
and we're involved in all sorts of conferences


00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.000
and helping out in the ecosystem overall.


00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.320
I think it's starting to become a big deal.


00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.000
>> Yeah, I would say.


00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.760
>> I'm really excited to be part of it.


00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.840
>> Yeah, I would say that's fantastic.


00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.640
Now, before we get into the main topic,


00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.120
let's hear a little bit about you and your background.


00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.480
How did you get into programming in Python?


00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.520
>> Yeah. It's an interesting story.


00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.760
When I was six, my grandpa bought me my first computer,


00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.800
and he was like an autodidact.


00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.880
He was an engineer,


00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.520
a petroleum engineer, and he learned all sorts of stuff on his own time.


00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.560
He wanted me to get into computers,


00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.240
and I started learning a little bit,


00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.800
but I never picked up programming because


00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.280
the consensus in the community where I grew up was like


00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.280
that programming was this thing that you needed academics to do.


00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.960
>> Okay. Yeah.


00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.600
>> You needed that education,


00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.640
you needed that university background, whatever.


00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.840
It was math, see, it was complicated.


00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.040
It's not something that a young person could do.


00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.600
Growing up in the '90s,


00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.440
that was a little bit more true then than it is now,


00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.760
but it still wasn't true.


00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.760
I went a different way and I ended up in music.


00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.000
I started studying music when I was a little older,


00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.600
and I gave up on my dreams of being a computer engineer.


00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.080
I even dropped out of school,


00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.200
never finished my education,


00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.640
wanted to be a full-time musician.


00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.880
That didn't work out. Turns out,


00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.280
it's not very well-paid and you really have to get lucky.


00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.160
>> Yeah. It's a tough one, right?


00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.720
It's fantastic if you can make it,


00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.920
but it's not easy.


00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.840
>> I gave it a good try. I learned a lot.


00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.040
But ultimately, I went back to IT.


00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.280
I did customer support,


00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.040
I did operations, stuff like that.


00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.960
My sweetheart, my love,


00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.120
she got me this book.


00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.400
This was 14 years ago.


00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.600
As almost like a joke for my birthday,


00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.000
she got me a C++ book.


00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.480
I don't know what to get you,


00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.720
but you like computers, right?


00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.800
I had this reaction like,


00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.360
"You don't know what you've done.


00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.840
This isn't for me. I can't do anything with this.


00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.200
This is for people who have the academics."


00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.480
All these preconceptions flared up,


00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.680
and I just felt like it was stupid.


00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.160
But she insisted I give it a try,


00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.880
and I read this book on a plane ride.


00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.640
It was simultaneously an epiphany that,


00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.280
"Holy shit, I can actually do this.


00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.080
I like this. This is logger."


00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.080
At the same time, I was pissed


00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.720
because I felt like my whole life,


00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.760
people have been lying to me,


00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.640
saying that I couldn't do this,


00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.240
and that I had disregarded it.


00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.240
I was 21.


00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.040
I could have started 10 years before that.


00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.280
- Yeah, I've been wasting my time


00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.960
because I had this misconception, right?


00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.160
- I think a lot of people labor under that misconception


00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.800
that programming is something that you can't easily,


00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.120
like that's something that people do


00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.680
after a university degree or whatever.


00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.560
But that's just really not the case, especially today.


00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.480
- Yeah, especially today.


00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.840
There's so many resources.


00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.400
Like you talk about getting a book in the '90s.


00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.400
And I got, I can't remember what,


00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.520
my C++ book I got in the '90s, but it was fantastic.


00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.400
But it was just a book.


00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.120
And if you got stuck, well, you read the chapter again.


00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.960
You know what I mean?


00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.800
And that was it, right?


00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.280
It was like really hard.


00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.280
Now there's YouTube, there's online courses, video courses,


00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.720
there's communities like Python Discord.


00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.640
The support that is there is much,


00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.320
so all this stuff that you're talking about,


00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.320
it's more true now than ever.


00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.400
- Yes, exactly.


00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.920
And I guess I've, you know,


00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.640
in my involvement in Python Discord,


00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.000
I'm trying to be part of letting people understand


00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.680
that that's true, like being that support system


00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.200
to help people get into programming,


00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.960
even though they're young and inexperienced,


00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.240
that it is possible.


00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.760
You can come hang out with us.


00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.600
We can help you get into Python,


00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.600
learn how, you know, take your first steps into development.


00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.600
I think that's important to be there.


00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.480
'Cause I, yeah, I'm a little upset


00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.880
that I didn't take that path earlier.


00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.800
- I didn't have quite the same experience,


00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.360
but I had a similar experience where I thought,


00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.320
oh, this is interesting, it would be cool,


00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.320
but there's no way I can do that.


00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.240
- Yeah.


00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.840
When did you start?


00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.960
- I started doing C++ programming


00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.160
my senior year in college for a research project


00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.360
because I had kind of been good with computers,


00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.840
but I didn't really consider myself a programmer.


00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.960
So I just, you know, I pursued other things


00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.880
like science and whatnot and math,


00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.560
and I just finally got into it.


00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.640
And the thing that really made me realize,


00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.440
like this is something I really like,


00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.320
is I remember working on these research projects,


00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.240
and it was a math research project,


00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.240
but also required a lot of visualization and programming.


00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.480
And I would be really excited


00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.680
when I'm doing the programming part,


00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.120
then I have to get some programming math.


00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.040
Like I just solve some of the math problems in code.


00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.760
And I'm like, oh, this part is kind of boring.


00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.600
Okay, back to the program.


00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.440
I'm like, oh, wait a minute,


00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.800
the part that I'm supposed to be here for


00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.840
is the part I like least.


00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.840
And the programming is just super awesome.


00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.040
Yeah, so later as well,


00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.600
but yeah, it's better late than never, right?


00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.520
- Yeah, no, that's sort of my story as well.


00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.240
Like when I picked up, I didn't really like C++,


00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.600
I learned C, I didn't really like that either.


00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.320
I got a little bit into like game programming.


00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.720
I looked at C#, later Unity,


00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.240
and none of it really clicked with me.


00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.040
But when I found Python, it was like,


00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.360
Angel Chorus, like finally I found my home.


00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.200
It was like the wool being lifted off my eyes,


00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.960
like I found my thing.


00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.840
And I started putting it in every facet,


00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.960
every corner of my life.


00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.600
Like I was working in,


00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.800
I was an ops engineer at the time,


00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.120
working for an ISP.


00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.680
And I just started automating all of the boring stuff.


00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.320
I was like Excel stuff.


00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.320
- You get so much joy out of that,


00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.040
'cause it's those things that just grind on you every day.


00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.640
And then you're like, wait a minute,


00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.960
that can happen instantly and automatic.


00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.520
That can go away.


00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.840
- And then after doing that for a couple of years,


00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.840
I realized that I was having way more fun


00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.680
than writing the code,


00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.480
then I wasn't doing anything else in my job.


00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.360
I needed to just like pivot.


00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.200
- Yeah.


00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.840
- But it's hard when you don't have that,


00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.400
any education, no real experience to find that first job.


00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.280
I applied like 50 places, I think,


00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.120
before someone really gave me a chance.


00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.240
And they only gave me a chance


00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.080
because they were like, yeah,


00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.560
but we'll give you a tough technical interview.


00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.960
It'll be like several stages.


00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.680
You'll have to write a whole project and send it in to us.


00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.720
This will take a week to finish.


00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.120
But I got through it and they were impressed


00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.080
and they gave me a chance.


00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.920
And once you get that first job,


00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.960
at least here in Norway, where I'm situated,


00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.320
they basically throw jobs at you


00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.760
if you have a couple of years experience.


00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.320
- I think that's pretty true in general.


00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.960
I think it's true in the US as well,


00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.480
where that first step is such a big one.


00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.840
But if you can get into the industry,


00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.680
then like, oh, you know what you're doing,


00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.680
then all these opportunities open up.


00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.560
So I think anyone who's out there listening


00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.560
who feels frustrated, like,


00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.240
oh, it's so hard to get that first job.


00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.360
Like that is the hardest career step


00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.720
you're ever gonna make, right?


00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.400
'Cause after that, it's just,


00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.200
it's so much smoother and easier.


00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.880
- I think especially for people who are in other jobs


00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.720
and they're looking to like change into development,


00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.560
it's tough.


00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.440
But once you have that foot in the door,


00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.440
it's amazing.


00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.280
Like I could pretty much change jobs today


00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.240
if I wanted to, to any number of other things.


00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.360
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.000
- But I won't because I love my job.


00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.520
- Yeah, so the other question I always got asked


00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.360
at the beginning of the show,


00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.240
it's 'cause it's really interesting to hear the perspective


00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.320
that people are coming from.


00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.160
- Yeah.


00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.200
- Are you a DevOps person?


00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.040
Are you a scientist?


00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.240
Are you a web developer?


00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.040
So what do you do these days?


00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.200
- So I'm working for a company called Dignio


00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.840
and we're a med tech company


00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.840
focused on remote care is the technical term for it.


00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.600
So essentially we're, okay, the pitch is,


00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.400
did you know that hospitals and governments in general


00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.920
spend like a significant amount of their budget


00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.120
dealing with chronically ill patients


00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.360
who make up a minority of the actual patients


00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.380
who are being treated?


00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.000
So we're spending like most of our money


00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.840
on the fewest of the people.


00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.800
- It's like the last one year of life is so expensive


00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.720
compared to the prior, you know, N minus one.


00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.640
- Yeah, and then you have this shift going on


00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.400
in certain countries where like the age groups are shifting


00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.680
so there are more older people


00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.640
and you need way more elder care.


00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.000
And it's expensive because the elderly


00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.960
often have chronic diseases.


00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.600
And again, that takes up an enormous amount of resources.


00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.240
So the main thing is they keep having to go to doctors,


00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.280
they have to go to hospitals to get like simple checkups


00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.960
and measurements.


00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.760
And so our solution is, well, they should do that from home.


00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.200
They shouldn't have to constantly be traveling around


00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.280
to places to like get their blood pressure measured


00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.360
or whatever.


00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.920
We can do that via Bluetooth and an app.


00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.640
And then you can just deliver all of the metrics


00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.360
to the doctor and they can contact them


00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.040
if something changes, if it looks bad, right?


00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.560
Like so that they get the treatment when they need it,


00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.000
but they don't have to constantly be wasting their own time


00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.760
and the, well, the government's resources


00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.480
essentially on taking the bus for four hours


00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.360
to get to the nearest whatever, it's stupid.


00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.200
So we're trying to solve that.


00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.600
- Yeah, that's fantastic.


00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.480
- And right now we're part of the COVID-19 thing.


00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.240
I mean, remote care plays a big role there.


00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.920
We wanna keep people out of hospitals obviously


00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.680
and prevent infection from spreading.


00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.200
So having them be, you know,


00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.520
they're doing their measurements at home,


00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.960
they're reporting their symptoms


00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.560
and taking their own temperature measurements


00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.400
and stuff like that.


00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.120
And the COVID-19 teams can just monitor them remotely.


00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.040
So we're working with the NHS in the UK,


00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.440
we're working here in Norway with the capital


00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.240
and with a bunch of hospitals.


00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.040
We're trying to get deeper into China.


00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.320
It's really exciting work.


00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.240
And I think that, you know, like ultimately


00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.480
it's important work.


00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.040
It makes me sleep well at night.


00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.360
- Yeah, yeah.


00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.240
You're legitimately helping people, right?


00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.080
- Yeah, right.


00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.240
I think ultimately we're gonna save lives.


00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.680
- At some point you inevitably save a life


00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.080
because you're helping relieve pressure


00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.480
from these critical systems.


00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.840
And maybe that's especially true during a pandemic.


00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.320
You have to like keep the capacity open at hospitals


00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.160
and so on like.


00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.840
- So I often think about what changes are going to stick


00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.680
after the pandemic is over or reduced


00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.120
and what's just gonna go back to normal, right?


00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.400
And I think that that kind of remote care stuff


00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.360
is going to stick.


00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.840
I think it's gonna be one of the things like,


00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.280
why didn't we just do this before?


00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.880
Right, you really don't need to come in to say,


00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.920
are you still feeling fine?


00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.760
Yeah, I'm feeling fine.


00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.680
Here's my measurements that my wearable has been collecting.


00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.840
Yeah, it looks like you're fine, right?


00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.240
- And we've been around for 10 years.


00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.800
Remote care has been around since the early 2010s,


00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.600
but it's like, as soon as the pandemic hit, it exploded.


00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.680
You've seen companies like Zoom


00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.160
and all of these people who specialize


00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.400
in having your doctor check up remotely.


00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.280
They're exploding.


00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.440
They're being propelled five, 10 years into the future


00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.520
in terms of like growth and opportunity.


00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.440
And yeah, that's not gonna go away


00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.120
after the pandemic calms down.


00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.000
We're here to stay now.


00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.880
And I know firsthand that municipalities


00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.400
and governments are buying in,


00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.240
like not just like temporary relief for COVID-19,


00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.680
but more permanent solutions for remote care and monitoring.


00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.720
So this is definitely one of the changes we're gonna see,


00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.200
I think, stick around.


00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.720
- And Python's powering some of that?


00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.160
- Python's powering most of that.


00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.520
Our whole backend is Python, Flask.


00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.600
Our infrastructure as code is mostly in Python


00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.360
and also a lot of Terraform.


00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.720
I've been involved across the whole stack.


00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.760
We also use Angular for our front end.


00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.020
We have Swift and Android and Kotlin.


00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.020
So there's a big stack,


00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.540
but Python is at its heart running the backend


00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.780
that talks to all of the different platforms


00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.140
that their services use.


00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.140
- Cool.


00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.140
- So-- - Yeah, yeah, very neat.


00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.380
- Yeah.


00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.420
- Sounds like a fun place to work.


00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.260
I was just gonna say,


00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.100
before we move on to the main topic though,


00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.020
there is one other thing that I think you are


00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.340
quite notable for in the recent days.


00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.020
- Yeah, I know what you're gonna say.


00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.300
- Yeah, yeah, so you did this beautiful song


00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.860
called the Pep8 song.


00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.860
And look at that, it's almost got 30,000 views on YouTube,


00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.100
which is pretty amazing.


00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.620
I'll put the link into the live stream


00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.640
for people to check out.


00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.980
But yeah, what was the inspiration behind that?


00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.540
That was really well received.


00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.380
That was a team effort, right?


00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.940
- That was a team effort.


00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.360
One of my admins, Daniel Brown, came to me with an idea.


00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.420
He said, "You know, wouldn't it be funny


00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.920
"if we did a version of Mad World,


00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.500
"but instead of saying Mad World, you sing Pep8,


00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.180
"and the whole song is just about..."


00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.900
So he just gave me the idea, and it was beautiful.


00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.780
I was like, "Yes, we need to do it immediately."


00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.220
I just got started.


00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.340
I got some people involved in helping out,


00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.380
finish everything up.


00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.980
And my sweetheart filmed it.


00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.940
So it was great.


00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.100
And I worked with, we have an outreach team


00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:45.060
at Python Discord with Sebastian Seff in the lead,


00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.480
and he helped get it out there.


00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.840
And I think we really managed to somehow get it out there.


00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.560
I mean, this could have been a thing that nobody ever saw.


00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.400
- Yeah, yeah.


00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.680
There's probably a lot of great stuff


00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.800
that got created and posted and went nowhere, right?


00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.920
- Yeah, for sure.


00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.840
No, this was fun.


00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.320
I can't really take much credit


00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.560
'cause it's just a cover of an existing song,


00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.040
but I've been making music since I was a teenager.


00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.080
Like I said, I tried to be a musician.


00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.960
So I cherish every occasion I get to actually sit down


00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.860
and make something fun.


00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.140
And like, especially when you can share it with a community


00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.640
and they like it.


00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.860
So most of the music I write, nobody will ever hear,


00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.080
or at least very few people.


00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.380
So this is just, yeah, it's been really fun.


00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.640
- Yeah, well, if you haven't heard the song,


00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.060
I'll put the link in the show notes.


00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.540
People should definitely check it out


00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.420
'cause it's all about the, you know,


00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.320
don't use try except pass.


00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.460
Here's what you do with comments.


00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.220
All the stuff that you learn about in PEP 8


00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.020
to write good Python code, but musical form.


00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:48.020
Isn't it bizarre how much music connects with your memory?


00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:53.060
You know, like my daughters, when they were younger,


00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.860
they would sing songs, they would know every word.


00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.020
There was this biology teacher who rapped


00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.660
the energy cycle of the cell, like mitochondria and all that.


00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.140
And like, she would study for biology


00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.500
by just listening to the rap about mitochondria.


00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.180
And you've got "Hamilton," the musical,


00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.300
which so many people listened to and learned about,


00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.740
like detailed American history,


00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.340
which they would think was so boring,


00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.900
but then it's in music form,


00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.140
so they now love it, right?


00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.260
That's weird, right?


00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.220
- The "Animaniac" song with all the states


00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.020
and the periodic table thing.


00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:25.860
- Yep.


00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.460
- Right, all of these are examples of,


00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.180
yeah, it's a vehicle for learning.


00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.500
I think it actually works.


00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.820
I love the PEP 8, it's really dear to my heart.


00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.940
(laughing)


00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.340
It's one of these documents, I think,


00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.660
that like it so perfectly explains


00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.580
sort of the culture of Python.


00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.220
And it's well-written, it's easy to read.


00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.260
You should all read it too,


00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.540
not just like listen to the song,


00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.740
you should go read the PEP 8.


00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.660
If you haven't read it, it's very, very edible.


00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.700
- Yeah, it's like the operating instructions


00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.820
for Python code.


00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.660
- Yeah.


00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.380
- Here's how you should get started, for sure.


00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.380
But the main thing that we're here to talk about today


00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.880
is Python Discord.


00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.780
- That's right.


00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.260
- So Discord is something kind of like Slack,


00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
but more focused on the gaming community traditionally.


00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.420
Why don't you just tell people what Discord is real quick,


00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.260
and then open up Discord.


00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.060
- Yeah, so they started out as sort of a competitor


00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.380
for stuff like TeamSpeak,


00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.900
and they wanted to be that gaming platform.


00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.460
But then they've sort of pivoted


00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.940
because they've attracted communities


00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.260
that are way outside of that core market.


00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.340
And now recently they've rebranded


00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.860
to being just like a place


00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.580
for people to have good conversations,


00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.380
like that local community feel,


00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.980
like you have a sewing club


00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.380
or your local swim team, get a Discord.


00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.620
And it really is a solid platform.


00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.780
They have very high quality video conversations


00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.180
and every feature that Slack has, and then some.


00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.140
- Yeah, what I really like is you can just go in there


00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.260
and you could be chatting in a room,


00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.900
or you could just say, click a button,


00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.540
and like, let's make this a video call.


00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.900
And then it is, right?


00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.740
- That's right.


00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.180
- It's really easy to sort of jump


00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.740
through the different mediums of communication there.


00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.540
- But I think the thing that they nailed that Slack isn't,


00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.060
I mean, Slack is really intended


00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.580
for these like small corporate teams


00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.900
so that you can have your own space.


00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.940
Whereas Discord is more for like open communities, right?


00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.300
So they want more people to join in.


00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.260
So it's got this discoverability aspect.


00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.940
You can grow your community as big as you want on Slack.


00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.180
Technically, after you have a certain amount of messages,


00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.220
they tell you, well, now you have to like pay


00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.900
to unlock the content in this channel.


00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.300
And that's not suitable if you have 100,000 people


00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.100
in the community and they're charging eight bucks a head.


00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.060
Like it doesn't work.


00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.780
So Slack's great for your work chat,


00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.100
but it's not really suitable for a massive community


00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.700
like Python Discord.


00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.460
So it's a really, really great place for that.


00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.260
A lot of tech platforms have moved to Discord as well.


00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.100
- Interesting.


00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.540
- The Reactiflux people, that's a massive server.


00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.500
Palettes projects, the people who made the flask


00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.940
and click, they're on Discord as well.


00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.220
Many of the game frameworks like Piglet


00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.100
and Pygame was there up until recently.


00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.980
I think they may have disbanded that server,


00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.740
but yeah, there's a lot of tech there happening.


00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.220
- Yeah, another thing that you talked about


00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.860
that's really interesting here is there's a whole way


00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.300
to program it with Python that allows you


00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.780
to sort of make it better, like bots and other things, right?


00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.620
- That's right.


00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.540
It's quite accessible to Python through this framework


00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.300
called Discord.py.


00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.660
So it's made by this guy called Danny


00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.780
and it's fairly easy to work with.


00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.380
It's fully asynchronous.


00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.060
So in that sense, it's a little high level.


00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.660
You have to understand the async await syntax.


00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.980
Not everyone learns that first day of Python,


00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.460
but once you get there, it's very nice.


00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.060
It uses type annotations in a clever way


00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.820
to convert the input that you send to the bot


00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.700
to something useful like a user or a channel.


00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.380
It uses lots of decorators.


00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.340
So it's actually quite a beautiful solution to that problem


00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.700
and you can make very, very scalable bots


00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.100
that can be on thousands of communities at the same time,


00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.020
interacting with like millions of users


00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.180
without it falling apart.


00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.620
- Yeah, yeah, very cool.


00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.100
Joe Banks out there in the live stream says,


00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.860
"At Python Discord, we'd hit the Slack limit


00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.820
of around a thousand, sorry, 10,000 messages


00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.260
in less than 10 hours."


00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.180
So yeah, that's not a great long-term solution, is it?


00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.140
- No, it wouldn't work for us.


00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.420
Joe Banks, of course, being one of the co-owners


00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.940
of Python Discord along with Sebastian Sepp.


00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.140
- Yeah, yeah, very cool.


00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.100
So how'd this get started?


00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.820
Tell us about the community.


00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.740
- Yeah, so about four years ago,


00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.780
I met Joe in this community.


00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.660
At that time, it had 200 users


00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.660
and it was a very different place.


00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.500
It wasn't like we didn't,


00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.100
nobody there really took it seriously.


00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.940
It was just a small server of people who were into Python.


00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.620
But then I guess there were a couple of us


00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.660
who started really seeing the potential


00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.660
that this had to be a great place to learn and to teach.


00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.140
And I've always believed that teaching


00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:23.500
is a fantastic way for me to cement my skills,


00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.180
to improve my own skills.


00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.540
So I've always tried to spend a lot of time


00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.020
teaching and tutoring


00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.140
because I thought it made me a better programmer as well.


00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:33.980
And it's a nice, wholesome thing to do.


00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.580
- Yeah, I totally agree.


00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.180
I think it does.


00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.460
- And I'm kind of sold that


00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.980
to a lot of more experienced users.


00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.740
You should spend your time here


00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.500
because it's gonna make you a better developer


00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.340
and because it's a nice thing to do.


00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.060
And we started getting more and more of those people


00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.500
who were into that culture.


00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.340
I think at that time, I felt like I wanted to create


00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.060
something that was in opposition to my experience.


00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.820
In the 90s, I spent a lot of time on IRC


00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.460
and IRC was not a nice place.


00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.380
It was very toxic.


00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.780
Generally, if you asked a question,


00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.060
you were told it was a stupid question


00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.820
and you shouldn't have asked it.


00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.500
And you were just sort of expected to know everything.


00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.620
And I think that people, young people coming into that,


00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.620
meeting that kind of toxicity on their first day,


00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.620
they could be discouraged from ever trying it seriously.


00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.620
So I think it's important to have a community


00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.300
where you're welcome with open arms,


00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.900
where we encourage stupid questions


00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.660
and hold your hand through them.


00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.820
- Yeah, and that's one of the things you said


00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.820
you're really trying to curate there at Python Discord


00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.380
is having a welcoming place for beginners, right?


00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.260
- Yes, we've curated that with, I should say,


00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.060
extreme prejudice.


00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.580
So we've been extremely harsh in getting rid


00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.460
of any kind of toxic element


00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.020
and just rooting out anything that didn't fit


00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.860
into our idea of the culture.


00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.660
So the culture is wholesomeness,


00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.340
like full blast wholesomeness.


00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.580
And we just wanna be the nicest little community


00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.020
on the internet where nobody's allowed


00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.340
to say anything mean or disrespectful


00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.260
because that just doesn't have any place


00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.660
in your first impressions of learning to code.


00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.620
I think that should be a nice and warm experience.


00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.260
It's harder now that we're so big,


00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.860
but back then it was easy.


00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.580
I could read every single message


00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.340
that was posted into the community.


00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.660
I could personally moderate everything that happened.


00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.300
And I did for a long while.


00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.580
But then as we grew bigger,


00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.460
we had to sort of build a set of staff members


00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.540
who agreed with our cultural values, our core values.


00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:41.660
And we started really growing because we were,


00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.820
it was important just to reach out to more people, I guess.


00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.540
And we really believed in what we were doing.


00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.700
So we were doing creative stuff.


00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.900
Like we looked for partnerships


00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.060
with other types of communities.


00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.020
We even found a different Python community


00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.940
that were roughly the same size as us.


00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.860
And then I had a meeting with them


00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.260
and convinced them to merge with us,


00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.620
which isn't really a feature in Discord.


00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.140
So what we actually did was we just mothballed


00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.740
the other community, removed every channel,


00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.700
left a link to ours,


00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.540
and tried to funnel all of their users into our community.


00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.140
- If you come here and you find it empty,


00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.420
this is where everyone's gone.


00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.060
- And then we took their staff members


00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.180
and invited them into our staff.


00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.140
Some of them are still there.


00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.180
Some of them are fantastic.


00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.980
Actually, one of the owners, Sebastian, came from there.


00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:31.740
And then, yeah, so we've done that.


00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:37.300
We partnered with the subreddit, r/python, quite early.


00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.980
Got in touch with Andrew Phoenix over there


00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.220
who runs the show and got involved there.


00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.020
And I think we got a lot of traffic via Reddit.


00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.660
We had some pretty good SEO search engines.


00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.900
- Reddit's really interesting, right?


00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.860
There's a lot of cool stuff happening


00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:52.900
with Python on Reddit,


00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.540
but also Reddit can be a little bit harsh.


00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.900
Like the people there can be a little bit rough


00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.220
for various reasons.


00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.700
So it's a bit of a mixed bag.


00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.460
You gotta be careful, right?


00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.380
- You do.


00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.500
Yeah, but I think the thing that happens, though,


00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.260
when people found us through,


00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.540
really through just Googling us,


00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.940
but they would Google, not specifically for us,


00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.700
they would Google Python Discord,


00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.260
thinking, "Hey, is there a Discord for Python?"


00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.420
But we decided, "Hey, what would be good


00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.980
"is if we just double down on that


00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.340
"and use that as our name,


00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.580
"get the domain pythondiscord.com, put it everywhere."


00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.460
Like if we are Python Discord,


00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.780
then that's the thing people Google,


00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.180
they're gonna find us.


00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.020
And that really worked, I think,


00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.860
was sort of a creative way to get our names out there.


00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.780
So yeah, we started really attracting people,


00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:46.140
and then we just kept partnering up with people.


00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.460
We got listed on python.org/community.


00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.300
- Nice.


00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.060
Yeah, there's a couple of people out in the livestream


00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.340
comments on the community thing.


00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.100
So Robert Robinson says, "The community's the best thing


00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.300
"for beginners to advanced developers."


00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.060
Three OS says, "There's no room for toxicity."


00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.980
I think that really is great.


00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.660
Robert also, "Not as harsh as Stack Overflow,"


00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.380
which is interesting.


00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:15.220
But how much do you think that the culture of Python itself


00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.180
matched with the programmer community


00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.340
that you guys are running?


00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.260
Say like if it was Java or C++,


00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.220
do you think they have slightly different backgrounds?


00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.100
Do you think it makes a difference?


00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.380
- It does, because these are the people that we attract.


00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.820
The staff members, they come from a place of understanding


00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.100
that Python has this kind of culture.


00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.660
And I think that we would have attracted


00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.540
a different set of staff members


00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.660
if Python didn't have such an inclusive culture.


00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.580
So by Python establishing,


00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.940
and they've done that all on their own,


00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.980
they've been amazing at building a really strong culture


00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.300
for Python, I think.


00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.580
And inclusivity has been like a really strong


00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.060
fighting point for them, I think.


00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.900
So that means that when we find these advanced Python users


00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.580
who are already renowned in their own way,


00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.500
they're like full-time Python developers,


00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.980
they're speakers at conferences, they're library maintainers.


00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.300
They're really nice people, generally.


00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.140
Like most of the people I meet in this community,


00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.660
they're already on board with what we're trying to do.


00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.060
So there's this synergy between the Python culture


00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.500
and our culture that's really played in our favor, I think.


00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.900
- Yeah, I would think so as well.


00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.220
I mean, there's the Brett Cannon quote,


00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.340
like I came for the language,


00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.540
stayed for the community type of thing, right?


00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.460
- Exactly.


00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.900
- Yeah.


00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.900
What have you done to try to keep that zen of that community


00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.300
as you've grown to over 100,000 participants?


00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.940
- So the main thing that,


00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.460
'cause now that we're getting so big, we have a big staff


00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.340
and running a big staff of 100 people is work.


00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.180
We have to start treating it almost like a startup.


00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:59.420
So being a staff member at Python Discord is a job.


00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.900
Like it's real work.


00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.500
We have meetings, we have several meetings.


00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.500
So we have meetings with the admins, with the leads.


00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.220
We have an all hands meeting.


00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.220
We have project meetings for certain projects


00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.060
that we're pursuing.


00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.340
We have a roadmap that we follow very carefully


00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.580
and plan out with the admins.


00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.540
Many of the admins have a domain that they look after.


00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.220
So like this guy is responsible for moderation


00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.320
and one person on maybe events.


00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.540
And that means that there's a bit of ownership.


00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.300
And through the entire staff,


00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.540
we've been like really actively perpetuating


00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.580
this focus on culture, right?


00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.260
And they all really agree with it anyway.


00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.780
So it's not like a hard sell,


00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:45.580
but by motivating our staff to follow that sort of ethos,


00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.340
it bleeds out to the rest of the community naturally


00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.100
in everything that we do there.


00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.380
Like I can't personally follow up all the stuff that we do,


00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.220
but it naturally happens through,


00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.720
I guess, a form of leadership.


00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.060
- Yeah, yeah, fantastic.


00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:03.380
So 3OS says, "I joined Python Discord for a question.


00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.380
"I'm still here for almost a year later.


00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.420
"Don't regret a single day."


00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.700
That's awesome, yeah.


00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.140
- It's really nice to hear stuff like this.


00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.540
- Yeah.


00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.820
So I think it sounds like a super cool community.


00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.820
People can go in there and talk about different topics,


00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.660
I imagine, right?


00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.900
Like if you wanna talk about Flask,


00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.220
there's a Flask section you wanna talk about.


00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.220
Getting started, there's probably something for that.


00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.600
- Yeah, so we've organized it so that


00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.960
there's a topical channel for a bunch of different topics


00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.220
that are basically like domains.


00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.660
So we have like an async channel,


00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.460
we have web development where you can ask,


00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.520
sure, Flask.


00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.620
Even if you have a JavaScript question,


00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.780
you're welcome to ask it there.


00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.540
We've got a place for game development frameworks,


00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.380
that kind of stuff.


00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.140
And there's also some general channels


00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.440
where you can talk about just about anything.


00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.620
And then beyond that,


00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.900
for people who just are looking for help,


00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.460
we built a system on top of Discord


00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.240
that's kind of unique to deliver help channels,


00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.900
almost like a ticketing system.


00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.640
So you come in and you claim a channel of your own,


00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.940
a help channel,


00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.700
and then in that channel, you can ask anything you want.


00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.340
And then you will be assigned sort of


00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.540
as the owner of that channel


00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.240
and people will come and help you.


00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.540
- Yeah, and you said that with this many people,


00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.620
you have to do like sort of a load balancing type thing


00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.380
to make sure that people can have some help


00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.100
but that it doesn't get overwhelmed


00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.620
and sort of partition it.


00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.700
You wanna talk about that a little bit?


00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.520
- It's been challenging.


00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.220
We used to have just like,


00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.140
oh, they're generic help, that was a channel.


00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:35.420
- Now it's just streaming by like telling a log, yeah.


00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.620
- Suddenly it was like three channels


00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.660
because there were so many people at the same time


00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.180
and you couldn't, nobody could ask anything.


00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.380
And then it grew to, I think, eight at its most.


00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.040
And we were just like, we can't keep scaling like this.


00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.740
We need to figure out a better solution.


00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.540
So we came up with this rotating channel claiming system.


00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.620
It's all run on the thing I mentioned earlier, discord.py.


00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.380
We wrote all the code for this.


00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.080
Members of the community volunteered,


00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.960
you know, like there are tens of thousands of lines of code


00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.940
in our bot that's directly responsible


00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.500
for running the community,


00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.600
running all these systems on top of the vanilla setup


00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.160
that discord gives us.


00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.800
It's a really powerful thing, you know,


00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.400
when you run a community full of programmers


00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.760
that uniquely you can then put them to work


00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.140
doing all this stuff that other types of communities


00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.200
would never be able to do


00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.080
'cause they just don't have that amount of, right?


00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.040
So many creative and wonderful people


00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.720
are willing to invest their free time


00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.520
to make something awesome for that.


00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.440
I really, I'm lucky to be surrounded


00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.980
by so many active contributors.


00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.700
I mean, we've had dozens of people help build this.


00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.560
- Yeah, I do think that having this programming skill,


00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.720
it's almost like being a magician, right?


00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.060
You can think of this idea and you're like,


00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.580
you know, I can make that happen.


00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.420
- Yeah.


00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.640
- I just, I got to think about it a little bit more


00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.960
and then it'll exist.


00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.420
And there's not many other things like that.


00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.160
- No, you're right.


00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.240
So much of the creative stuff,


00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.360
actually you've got to,


00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.600
eventually the rubber meets the road.


00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.960
You've got to create a thing, right?


00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.520
Like if you're a chemist or you're an engineer,


00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.080
like you can create, you can imagine things,


00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.840
but eventually they got to get built.


00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.880
But for programmers,


00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.080
it's just sort of more thinking until it exists.


00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.120
And it's really cool to see like communities


00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.940
putting that to you.


00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.160
So like, oh, I have this idea.


00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.240
What if the bot could do this?


00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.840
Well, you know, here's the source code, make it do that.


00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.280
- Yeah, it's like a superpower.


00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.520
I think one person who knows how to code in a community,


00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:29.040
it can be like a wizard who makes stuff happen.


00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.800
And I have a hundred wizards.


00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.840
So like I can do whatever I want pretty much.


00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.960
It's amazing.


00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.400
It really makes the difference.


00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.920
I think that's that little extra cherry on top


00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.360
that makes this community really shine.


00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.760
- Yeah, well, and the fact that Discord has an API


00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.720
and doesn't try to like lock it off


00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.240
and make it impossible to sort of do extra stuff, right?


00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.400
- Right.


00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.360
I mean, it's not by any means trivial,


00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.400
but there are good packages out there


00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.120
that abstract all the pain away,


00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.560
or most of the pain anyway.


00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.200
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.260
Yeah, super cool.


00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.400
So one of the things that you all have been doing


00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.480
is you've been running different kinds of events.


00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.160
Do you want to tell us about some of the events


00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.160
and things you've done and maybe we'll do in the future?


00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.760
- So I think a lot of people come to us with a question


00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.960
or to find some help or some guidance,


00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.940
but then we want them to stay.


00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.640
And one of the ways that we try to do that


00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.200
is to always have something going on.


00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.360
And the events is our way of like having an activity


00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.060
always happening in the community.


00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.960
So we started with, we created a second bot


00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.320
that was just for fun.


00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.800
And then we had like monthly events,


00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.720
like a Valentine's event or Halloween event,


00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.060
where we would invite people to solve these simple problems.


00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.440
So for the Halloween event, we would say,


00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.540
okay, I want you to write a spooky movie recommender.


00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.120
It's just a function, right?


00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.760
And so we provide the bot and the infrastructure


00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.160
for the bot to run on.


00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.240
You just write a command for the bot.


00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.680
It's really just a function that returns a spooky movie.


00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.000
That's fairly easy for people to do.


00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.280
And so we get people willing to take on that task.


00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.400
And then we filled up this bot with all of these things.


00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.200
So every month we would have a theme


00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.440
and then we would get more people involved in that.


00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.400
But here's the tricky part is we would force them


00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.700
to commit it to GitHub.


00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.860
It would go through reviews.


00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.240
We were kind of harsh reviewers.


00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.740
Sometimes we will give a proper review,


00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.720
but we do it in a very educational way, I think,


00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.820
where we explain very clearly why something needs to change,


00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.980
if it needs to change.


00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.660
We have a continuous integration systems


00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:38.580
and continuous deployment set up on all of these things


00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.500
so that the code has to lint properly,


00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.580
has to get through, has to match the PEP-8 basically,


00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.780
and run tests and all this stuff.


00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.940
So it sounds easy when you start off, yeah,


00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.620
you're just writing a simple function


00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.900
to return a spooky movie.


00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.860
But then actually we're stealth educating these people


00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.900
on how to work on an open source framework, right?


00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.620
Like inside of a--


00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.580
Right, teaching them all the engineering workflow


00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:11.660
stuff of linting, CI, GitHub, all that kind of stuff.


00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.480
And I think that that stuff is amazing to know if you want


00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.400
to go out there and work in the field.


00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.620
You have to know these things.


00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.300
But there aren't that many places online


00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.540
that will try to teach you those places.


00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.040
Yeah.


00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.220
Well, it's also all the difference between,


00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.220
is this a real programmer or someone


00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.300
who just has learned a little bit about the language, right?


00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.820
Whenever I was doing interviews, you


00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.900
could always sort of tell, is this person really


00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.940
in the community?


00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.820
Do they kind of know the moving part?


00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.140
You know what I mean?


00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.540
Because I would interview people,


00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.580
and they would sometimes just make up stuff that they know.


00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.540
I'm like, you don't actually know this, do you?


00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.580
So you can tell that this is not a thing, right?


00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.560
And I think having those skills-- it depends how you get


00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.240
into programming, but a lot of people come into Python.


00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.060
They don't come through the, I went to Carnegie Mellon


00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.820
for four years.


00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.380
They come through the, I got inspired.


00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.660
I got a book, or I got some kind of thing where I started


00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.860
learning programming, and I've been mostly on my own,


00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.060
but I'm trying to get into the world of programming.


00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.060
And no one tells you you need to learn


00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.740
about continuous integration.


00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.420
Right, exactly.


00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.340
Most people, right?


00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.340
Or unit testing frameworks, or what have you.


00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.620
I actually, we do the same thing when we interview for my job.


00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.660
We often focus on the soft skills.


00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:23.620
We try to, like, if we can determine whether someone


00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.900
writes a good commit message, that tells you a lot about them,


00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.700
even though it's not strictly the thing


00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.020
that we're actually looking for.


00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.620
We're looking for talented programmers,


00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:36.420
but the two things are slightly linked in a way.


00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.180
One indicates the other.


00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.340
But yeah, so that was our first sort of,


00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.780
our first step into events.


00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.940
And then it grew from there.


00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:45.940
I had this idea.


00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.140
I started a code jam, and I wanted


00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.460
it to be a unique thing, because again, a lot of people


00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.260
do code jams, and they're mostly game jams.


00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.060
Give us a quick, what's the elevator pitch?


00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.780
What's a code jam?


00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.620
So a Python Discord code jam, or just a code jam in general?


00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.660
In general.


00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.340
In general, it's you have a week.


00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.100
You have to solve a problem.


00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.020
You don't necessarily know what the problem is


00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.100
before you start solving it.


00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.140
And maybe you have to solve it within a specific context,


00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.180
so like a framework or a language, something like that.


00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.020
And then afterwards--


00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.420
Like use React to build a game, a 2D scroller game in a week,


00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.500
something like that maybe.


00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.980
Something like that.


00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.660
And so we wanted to do a spin on this,


00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.740
to activate our users to do something fun for a week.


00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.620
But again, I'm trying to do something


00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.700
that nobody else is doing.


00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:40.180
So my spin was you have to do it with a team of strangers,


00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.020
not on your own, not with some people you know.


00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.660
You have to get out of that safety net, out of your comfort


00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.820
zone, and solve a problem in a setting


00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.420
that you might see in an open source project or in a job.


00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.620
Yeah, because one of the challenges can be there


00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.300
might be these people who've done these before, right?


00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.700
Like these groups of people, we all go to college together.


00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:01.300
We were roommates.


00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.380
Now we just go do these events because they're fun,


00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.620
and we still do them together.


00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.460
But if there's a tight knit group of four people that say,


00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.500
OK, you do the database.


00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.220
I'll do the UI.


00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.060
You do the back end.


00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:10.700
Go, right?


00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.220
That's not the same thing as a couple of people.


00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.540
I want to be part of it too.


00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.660
We'll find some random folks to meet up, right?


00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.820
So you're kind of trying to equalize that a little.


00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.380
Yeah, they would come in and annihilate everyone.


00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.100
And I want people to be uncomfortable.


00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.300
I want them to do something hard and to come out


00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.500
of it having learned how to overcome those challenges,


00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.580
right?


00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:36.500
So that's the pitch is that we team you up with some people


00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.340
you've never met.


00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.180
We give you a framework.


00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.500
Let's say you have to write a Django app.


00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.180
And then on the day you start, we tell you, oh,


00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:48.660
and by the way, it has to be thematic of climate change.


00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:54.340
Or we had one where we said that the theme was this app hates


00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.380
you.


00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.380
And so we ask people to make apps that hate you.


00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.780
I think I've used some of those.


00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.420
Super fun.


00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:01.920
Yeah.


00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.140
My favorite, I remember there was this one team.


00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.100
They made a paint clone similar to MS Paint.


00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:12.460
But all of the different tools were terrible in their own way.


00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.340
So you would use the paintbrush, but it would drip paint


00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.540
on top of the canvas.


00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:17.180
How beautiful.


00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.620
And the pencil, the tip would break.


00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.180
And it would fall.


00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.580
You'd have to constantly be like--


00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.660
yeah, so each tool uniquely terrible.


00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:28.300
Really fun.


00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.580
Now, recently we had one where the theme


00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.500
was early internet.


00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:36.940
And we had a team that created sort of a Windows 98 or Windows


00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.460
95 clone in Django.


00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.980
And I was like, yeah, this is cool.


00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:45.500
And it looked fairly nostalgic.


00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.540
But then the actual thing inside of that Windows clone


00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.300
was that there was a working browser.


00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:58.320
And when you use the browser, they would intercept the HTML


00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.140
and modify it to look like early internet.


00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:05.220
They would pixelate the images or add filters and stuff


00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.380
to make it look old and kind of broken.


00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.460
It's really, really genuinely interesting.


00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.460
And you could go to any page on the web.


00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:13.960
Wow.


00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.800
People do these amazing things within the limitations


00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.180
we set for them.


00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.220
It's really inspiring to watch some of the stuff.


00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.260
We actually make some videos on our YouTube.


00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.540
There are highlights videos.


00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.620
Yeah, that's nostalgic.


00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.320
There are highlight videos on our YouTube


00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.740
that show off some of the projects


00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.220
that people come up with.


00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.940
We're going to release another one within a month or two


00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.700
for the code gem that was last summer.


00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:41.740
Yeah, that's really cool.


00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.300
Yeah, we should link to those.


00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.580
I think back to the early internet, gosh,


00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:50.700
if you had modern tools and a modern tool chain,


00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.780
you could just blow people's minds.


00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.340
I mean, it was so bad.


00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.060
It was so incredibly bad, right?


00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:57.560
Just--


00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.460
Yes.


00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.300
Ah.


00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.340
Yeah.


00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.380
The Amazon ones are the absolute worst.


00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.340
You should all go and look up what


00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.980
Amazon looked like in its first iteration.


00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.780
Hilariously bad.


00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.780
Yeah, it's-- oh, my gosh.


00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.940
Yeah, so these are some of the types of things you do, right?


00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:14.660
These events.


00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.740
Do you have any coming up?


00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.180
We have-- oh, that's another one.


00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.780
We've invited PyWeek, which is actually


00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.900
a 15-year-old Python event, one of the oldest, probably


00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:29.700
the longest-running game jam in the entire ecosystem.


00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:35.140
We basically offered to take it into our fold


00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.140
and help them advertise it, market it,


00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:41.020
and to put it together because they were stretched


00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.980
a little thin, maybe.


00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:50.100
And Daniel Pope, who runs it currently, Maev, Lord Maev,


00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.340
he's just become a father, I think.


00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.300
He's quite busy with things.


00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.140
That changes your perspective on free time.


00:41:59.140 --> 00:41:59.780
Yeah.


00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.860
Or it changes your free time.


00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.900
He's a wonderful guy.


00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.100
I really enjoyed working with him on the previous PyWeek


00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.340
we ran last autumn.


00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.980
And now we're probably going to help him put one together.


00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.060
He's still running the show, but we help out


00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:12.980
in every way we can.


00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.140
So there's a PyWeek coming up sometime this spring.


00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.300
I don't know if a date has been announced yet.


00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.500
Then we have a Code Jam this summer.


00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:26.060
And in October, we run the Hacktoberfest events.


00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.140
December, we run Advent of Code together


00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.900
with the Advent of Code staff.


00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.500
There's basically something happening every couple months.


00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.340
What do people do to participate?


00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.380
How do they participate?


00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:41.180
Well, if you're a member of the community,


00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:47.620
if you type exclamation mark subscribe in the bot commands


00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:52.500
channel, you will be subscribed to announcements.


00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.340
We basically will ping you every time


00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.540
something big is happening.


00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.820
So we will always let you know.


00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.300
There's also an event page on our website.


00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.660
You can usually see major upcoming events


00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.980
on the front page.


00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.500
There's an events subpage there that has everything listed.


00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.620
So it's fairly hard to miss if you're


00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.980
a member of the community.


00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.380
But yeah, the subscribe command for our bot,


00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.340
that will make sure that you will definitely


00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.140
be let know.


00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.580
That's how we keep people informed.


00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:23.020
Yeah, very cool.


00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.380
Sounds like a lot of fun for people


00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:25.820
to participate in these things.


00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.340
Another thing that you did recently that was noteworthy


00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:35.620
is you all hosted the core developer sprints.


00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.260
Yeah, that was interesting.


00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.580
I mean, obviously, we love the PSF, the Python Software


00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.460
Foundation.


00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.220
And we have a core developer on the staff as well.


00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:53.620
Kyle Stanley, he's a core developer who works on AsyncIO.


00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.140
He's great.


00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.540
He's one of our moderators.


00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.460
And so he got in touch with me and told me


00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.620
that, well, because PyCon was canceled,


00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:05.100
and usually they have this core dev sprint at PyCon,


00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.380
they sit together for a week.


00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.180
And they just work on like CPython stuff together.


00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.900
I think a lot of people don't realize


00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:16.220
that when PyCon fell victim to the pandemic like everything


00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.740
has, that there's so much of that that happens.


00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.220
You know, in open source, you could work for years


00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.980
and never actually face to face have a conversation with someone


00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.140
you're working with, right?


00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.900
So a lot of those sprints, both for core developers in Python,


00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.420
but also for Flask and Django and other groups


00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.180
would have these get togethers where people


00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.460
could come and contribute.


00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.340
And yeah, that kind of fell by the wayside, right?


00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.580
Yeah, I think that was a big--


00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.660
a lot of people took it quite poorly.


00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.740
I mean, that's like the highlight of their year.


00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.860
Many of them-- if you're a core developer,


00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.740
the PSF will pay your ticket to come and hang out with them


00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.500
and do the core sprint.


00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.980
And it's like this big event.


00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.700
I would love to do that myself, sit down


00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.660
with some of these smartest people.


00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.740
I know, it'd be amazing.


00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:02.980
I always consider PyCon my geek holiday.


00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:06.020
It's like my chance to get away and just enjoy time


00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.620
with my friends who I only see at conferences,


00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:11.740
go to Goddard, have dinner and beer with them afterwards.


00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:16.260
I've never been because I had to cross the Atlantic to get there.


00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.180
But hopefully, one day.


00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.980
So someday soon, hopefully.


00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.300
Right, so they canceled that.


00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.300
And so they were looking for an alternative way


00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.780
because they needed to do the core dev sprint,


00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.780
but obviously they had to do it remotely.


00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:30.220
So they were looking into how they would host that.


00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:34.940
And I just suggested to Kyle that if you guys are interested,


00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:38.380
EuroPython did it on Discord recently.


00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:39.980
And we could host you.


00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:43.220
We could set up everything you need, all the channels,


00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.180
take care of moderation.


00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.620
If you want to reach out to the community or something,


00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:50.540
we could put together a call or something like that.


00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.540
And they were interested.


00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.740
And eventually, they voted in favor of doing that.


00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.060
So we had all the core developers, 40 of them


00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:00.420
at least, hanging out with us.


00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.740
And we left them--


00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.220
I mean, they had their own sort of gated off


00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.020
area of the community where they did this.


00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.100
And we've done that for some of the other events,


00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.100
like FOSDEM most recently.


00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:16.060
We hosted their organizers and their talk, their speakers,


00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:19.020
so that they have an area to be in without having


00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.660
to go through the hassle of setting up their own community


00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.220
and managing and administrating all of that.


00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.420
Because it is work.


00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.100
Yeah.


00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.100
So what's that look like in practice?


00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.100
They have their own channel.


00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:34.060
Then they do screen share for the presentations.


00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:34.660
Yeah.


00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:37.980
We just set it up so that all they got to do is just join.


00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.460
And then right at the top of the channel list


00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.740
is just all the stuff that's relevant to them.


00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:46.380
Nobody else can see it, just the organizers


00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.500
and the members of that event.


00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.780
So for them, it almost looks like we've just set up


00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.020
a whole server just for them.


00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.660
And then at the bottom, if they want to,


00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:55.380
they can go and explore our public channels


00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.740
and talk to the community.


00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.580
And some of them did.


00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.500
And there was a lot of really good interaction


00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.780
with the other members of the community.


00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:07.780
But if they want to and if they want privacy, which many of them


00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:11.540
did, they can just stay in their own gated-off area.


00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.340
That's been one way that we've been


00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.540
able to give back to the ecosystem a little bit


00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.500
and help out.


00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:22.260
And of course, they also chose to have a Q&A that they


00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.020
collected questions from the community.


00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.860
And they wanted to do a stream.


00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.340
And we put together the stream on YouTube for them.


00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:34.460
It's available both on the PSF's own YouTube and on ours.


00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:38.220
A full-length, hour-long, I think,


00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.380
core developer Q&A from questions from the community.


00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.500
Really, really interesting.


00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.620
I highly recommend it.


00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.180
Yeah, nice.


00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.300
That's fantastic.


00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.180
Yeah, it was really fun.


00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.260
We really love the PSF.


00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.900
We work with them on other stuff.


00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.480
They're looking for help get their announcements out there.


00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:01.860
We have quite a bit of reach by now, in part due to--


00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:05.420
like our announcement channel, sure, it reaches our 150,000


00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.140
members.


00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:10.220
But there's also a feature where you can subscribe to--


00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:14.140
you can put our announcements into your community.


00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.980
And there's 2,000 communities right now


00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.580
that sort of relay all of the announcements we make.


00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.140
So then that reaches an additional--


00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.580
I don't even know how many people.


00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.700
And then we've got Twitter.


00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.720
Does that push notifications out to other Discord communities


00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.560
or some other types of communities?


00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.320
Is it like Discord?


00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.840
It's only Discord, yeah.


00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.720
So there's 2,000 Discord communities.


00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.880
Probably most of them are small, 10 people


00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.880
who are friends or whatever kind of communities.


00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.720
But there are some that are rather big.


00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, very cool.


00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.600
Yeah, it seems like the community, like the core devs


00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.040
and advanced channel, it's very nice.


00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.640
Yeah, awesome.


00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.040
Quite cool.


00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.840
So I guess one other thing that we


00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.520
could talk about that you guys are doing


00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.280
is you have some open source stuff.


00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.200
Like your bot, for example, is open source and so on.


00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.800
You want to talk a little bit about some of the code?


00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.920
Yeah, I mean, we have a lot of open source repositories.


00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:16.240
And we try-- so this is about--


00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.520
Python Discord has to be a great place for beginners


00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.840
to discover programming and to get help and so on.


00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.000
But it also needs to be a place that's engaging


00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.640
for more advanced users.


00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.560
And one of the ways that we're doing that is to try to provide


00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.680
learning opportunities, even for people


00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.280
who have years of experience with Python.


00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.920
And one of the ways that you can improve, hone your skills


00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.760
and get better is to work on exciting projects that


00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.160
help the community.


00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.500
So we've open sourced everything.


00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.640
We're very transparent about how everything works.


00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:49.480
And there's a whole bunch of projects from the bots.


00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.120
There are three, four bots by now, I think.


00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.640
No, three.


00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.520
We've got the website, of course,


00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:01.000
and some microservices that interact with the website.


00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.600
Snackbox is an interesting one.


00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:07.240
That's a completely sandboxed Python evaluation tool.


00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.400
That's right, yeah.


00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.720
So that we can have a command on the server


00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.200
where people can run actual raw Python code without them


00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.640
being able to destroy all our servers.


00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.240
Because there is, of course, a risk associated with people--


00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.280
Yeah, that's the danger of it.


00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.520
You want to test this code out?


00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.080
Click here.


00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.640
Oh, wait, the code I'm trying to test


00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:32.000
is subprocess launch such and such, or whatever.


00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.440
Yeah, so we have several layers of sandboxing.


00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.600
If it takes too long, or if it uses specific parts


00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.960
of the standard library that might be used in a malicious


00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.880
way, then it just doesn't do it at all.


00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:49.480
But even if it does do it, it's inside of one sandbox that's


00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.640
inside another sandbox.


00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.720
And it's very, very safe.


00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:52.800
And this is open source.


00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.320
You can take this tool, Snackbox,


00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.560
and you can use it in your bot, or in your website,


00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.120
or whatever service you want if you


00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.520
want to be able to safely evaluate Python code.


00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.080
Nice.


00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.640
So what are some examples, like how this gets used in Discord?


00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:10.440
The Snackbox?


00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.680
We actually only use it for the bot


00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.440
so that people can evaluate code.


00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.560
But that function is very valuable,


00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:20.720
because in help sessions, sometimes our helpers,


00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.600
or people who are trying to explain something,


00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.400
they want to execute some code and show what the result is


00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.280
to explain a concept.


00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.520
So someone's stuck on, how does this work?


00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.800
Well, then they can just show them with a code example,


00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.520
and it evaluates it right there.


00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.080
It's a very nice teaching aid, essentially.


00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.160
Yeah, that's quite cool.


00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:40.680
Nice.


00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.120
Any other projects you want to highlight?


00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.000
Yeah, for sure.


00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.840
We try to do projects that aren't strictly just code,


00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.240
as well.


00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.520
For instance, in our staff, we have


00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.880
some people who are involved in the DevOps side of Python


00:51:57.880 --> 00:51:58.640
Discord.


00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.680
We have a very modern DevOps architecture


00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.920
using Kubernetes cluster.


00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:10.440
Everything is set up with--


00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.360
everything's its own containerized service.


00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.760
And some of us are really learning


00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.360
how to do advanced, I think, industry standard DevOps


00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.440
by doing it here at Python Discord.


00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.040
We have media projects and branding projects


00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.880
with people who have graphic design skills.


00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.920
They come in and help us.


00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.440
They--


00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.720
Oh, that's clever.


00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.520
Say we have a Halloween event.


00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.600
Oh, you can come in and make a spooky banner or something


00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.520
that we might put somewhere, right?


00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.080
Try to get people involved like that.


00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.840
Now we're making a lot of YouTube content,


00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.000
like the Pep8 song.


00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.400
That means we need editors.


00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.240
We need people who are good at animation, maybe,


00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:48.320
people who can do sound, music, all


00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.000
of these kinds of skill sets.


00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.160
We try to provide an avenue for them to involve themselves.


00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.000
And if you've got a unique skill set that I didn't mention


00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.040
or I couldn't even think of, then


00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.960
if you come and advertise to us, maybe


00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.040
we'll be able to find some creative way where


00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:06.000
we can put that to use.


00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.540
Yeah, that's a really interesting way


00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.480
to leverage the community, not just the core programming


00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.600
skills, but the other stuff as well.


00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.480
Yeah, and I think it's really essential that we


00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.760
have this kind of approach.


00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.040
Because I think the thing that's difficult about running


00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:26.760
a community of volunteers is that if you run a business,


00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.680
well, I can buy productivity.


00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.680
I pay you.


00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.760
You make me something, right?


00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:36.120
But when I have a community of volunteers, I can't pay you.


00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.800
I don't have any money to pay you with.


00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.880
So the only way I can get you to do something


00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.640
is to motivate you.


00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:45.360
And there's some intrinsic motivation


00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.520
in being part of something good and wholesome like this.


00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.120
I think the culture helps bring people in


00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.000
from an altruistic point of view.


00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.120
They just want to help out.


00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.880
They want to be a good force in the universe.


00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:04.200
But ultimately, if you really want strong, directed


00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.440
initiative and motivation, I think


00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:13.800
you have to find a synergy, a sort of a thing


00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.520
where your personal goals align with the goals


00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.640
of the community, right?


00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.360
So you want to do something for us that's good for you,


00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.600
but it's also good for us.


00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.800
That's the perfect way to motivate people.


00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.680
So by providing as many ways as possible for people


00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.600
to get involved like that, it means


00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:34.040
that people can come in and actually build their skill set.


00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.720
Maybe they make something impressive,


00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.240
and they can put it on their resume.


00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.000
They can go out and get a job.


00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.440
And we're very good at trying to give people credit and help


00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.600
people out.


00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.600
I've personally been a job reference


00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.480
for many of the staff members.


00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.000
I've written letters of recommendation,


00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.640
stuff like that, because we really want people to come in.


00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.360
And if they invest themselves into our community


00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.360
and invest hours of work, I want them to get something out


00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.720
of it personally, because that's the best way


00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.320
that I can motivate them to keep working.


00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:06.840
Yeah.


00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.920
Does it cost money?


00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.360
Is it expensive to run the community, servers,


00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.600
and bandwidth, and all that?


00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.440
We've been lucky enough to be sponsored by everyone


00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.680
we needed to be sponsored by.


00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.880
So we have Linode as a sponsor.


00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:27.480
We've got Notion providing free documentation stuff for us.


00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.240
So with a bunch of different partners


00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:34.880
we've worked with and sponsors for prices for the events,


00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:35.760
like Adafruit.


00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.240
We've worked with DigitalOcean.


00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.600
JetBrains has been giving us licenses


00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.600
we can give away for a long time.


00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.040
Sentry is another sponsor.


00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.240
They give us Sentry monitoring.


00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:50.680
So that covers our essentials.


00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:54.480
And we don't pay for hosting, because Linode is providing


00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.280
all the hosting for free.


00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.120
But we do have some expenses associated with the events.


00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.080
T-shirts that's sent out as prizes, this sort of thing.


00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.600
And some of that comes in via our Patreon.


00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:12.840
I'm really happy with this animated explainer video


00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.160
that we send to everyone who joins the community called


00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:17.080
Welcome to Python Discord.


00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:20.600
In that one, we went out and found some voice talent


00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:24.120
to do a voiceover for us so that we could get that Kurskisakt


00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.920
style voiceover.


00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.040
I specifically asked the guy, can you do a Kurskisakt voice?


00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.680
And he was like, yeah, I can do that.


00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.400
Oh, nice.


00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.000
And I'm so happy with the results.


00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.200
But that's an example of where we might have


00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.000
put in a little bit of money.


00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.320
Not that it was super expensive.


00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.160
He was very generous.


00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:41.480
Right.


00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.240
Yeah, that's cool.


00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.960
But it's not super expensive.


00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:47.640
Say, PyPI is really expensive to run


00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:50.480
if it weren't for the sponsors and the donations, right?


00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.480
Like $40,000 a month with bandwidth and stuff like that.


00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:57.240
Yeah, no, because the majority of that bandwidth


00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.840
is, I guess, Discord is paying that.


00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.360
And we're not paying--


00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.240
it's free to run a community on Discord


00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:05.640
no matter how big it gets.


00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.600
That's cool.


00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:11.920
So essentially, no, it's fairly cheap to make ends meet here.


00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.920
We try to put all the money that we get in straight back out


00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.080
to the community as prices or in giveaways or whatever we can.


00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.040
Because we're not trying to make money.


00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.760
We're just trying to provide the best possible experience


00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.120
that we can for our users.


00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.040
Yeah, super cool.


00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.920
One thing that we talked about a little bit


00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.200
before we hit record that I think is interesting


00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:36.600
is you'd mentioned how some of the infrastructure


00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:40.240
and some of the ideas you get to apply and experiment with here


00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.680
are things that you can actually bring back to your A job,


00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.400
where you wouldn't get a chance to say,


00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.400
oh, let's try this thing with Kubernetes


00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.680
or whatever it is you're doing.


00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:49.640
But you can try it here.


00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.060
And then if it works, you're like, oh, yeah, we tried this.


00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.160
Here's how it's working.


00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.920
I think there's this interesting interplay


00:57:54.920 --> 00:58:00.560
between work, work, your main professional experience,


00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.760
and then these kind of more freeform places


00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.280
where you have more control to do whatever you want.


00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:08.480
Yeah, we try to encourage that kind of thing.


00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.920
Now we're thinking about doing a rewriter for our API


00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.320
into FastAPI.


00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.080
It's currently a Django RESTful API.


00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.120
And the primary motivation for that


00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.360
is because one of the owners needs


00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.520
to learn FastAPI for work.


00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:23.680
That's a really good reason to do it.


00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.680
And of course, it gives us an extra benefit


00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:27.480
because it could use a rewrite.


00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.360
But probably we wouldn't have done it


00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.480
unless we had someone who was sort of personally motivated.


00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.280
So yeah, in a way, I think especially


00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.920
at the top of the executive leadership,


00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:40.040
we try to use Python Discord as sort of a sandbox


00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:44.280
to experiment with stuff and learn skills


00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.000
that we can take with us to work.


00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.560
Yeah, it gives a lot of people experience with things


00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.760
that they otherwise might not get to touch.


00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.520
Because that API that they work on at work,


00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.840
it's been Django REST framework for five years.


00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.040
And there's no reason to change it.


00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:58.720
And they're not changing it because it works.


00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:59.600
Don't touch it.


00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.800
Yeah, exactly.


00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:03.600
I learned Kubernetes from Python Discord myself.


00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.240
And now I'm bringing it to work with me


00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.920
because we don't have that kind of sophistication


00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.280
there quite yet.


00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.920
And that's just one example.


00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.840
I've learned half of everything I know, I think,


00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:13.600
at Python Discord.


00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.400
Because of course, I'm in a unique position


00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.120
of being able to do pretty much whatever I want there.


00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.400
Yeah, exactly.


00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.720
I think that's the secret to being on the cutting edge


00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.960
is you find these places where you can try things out.


00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.080
And then you have that experience


00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.680
maybe to bring back to more conservative type


00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.480
of environments.


00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:37.320
I think that this kind of way of using the community


00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.320
has been mostly available to the owners


00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.720
up until we grew to this size.


00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:44.400
And now I'm trying to expand that to the rest of the staff


00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.160
and anyone who wants to get involved.


00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.720
Please, come and use us as a way for you


00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.280
to learn that next thing that you're


00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.360
thinking about learning.


00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.160
Maybe we can provide you an opportunity to--


00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.680
and you're really looking to get into making


00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.400
great sounding audio.


01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.720
Maybe we have an opportunity for you to hone


01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.920
your craft and practice.


01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.880
Yeah, yeah, very cool.


01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.520
All right, well, I think that's about it for the time


01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.280
that we have to talk about Python Discord.


01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.600
But congratulations on such a cool community, you


01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.360
and everyone else.


01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.400
I know it isn't just you.


01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.600
You're the figurehead for the community, right?


01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:24.560
Maybe, in a way, because I have a freakishly large beard.


01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.560
And there's a small cult of personality


01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.480
around my lemon nickname.


01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.560
We have a whole set of emojis with lemons.


01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:35.160
Oh, nice.


01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.160
So it's sort of-- but yeah, I don't know.


01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.560
We have a lot of really notable members of the community


01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.640
once you get to know them.


01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.720
It's so many great people involved.


01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.320
So it's just a wonderful place to be.


01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.800
Yeah, fantastic.


01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.560
All right, final two questions before I let you out of here.


01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.040
Yes.


01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.800
If you're going to write some Python code,


01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.360
what editor are you using these days?


01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.880
So I use PyCharm.


01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.120
And I use a little bit of VS Code on the side


01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.320
when I need to do something really simple


01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.680
or whenever I want to do this code collab thing.


01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.760
So PyCharm has code with me.


01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.400
And there's the live sync thing on VS Code


01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.440
where you can actually live collaborate on files.


01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.600
I've been getting into that.


01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.880
It's really cool to work two people live editing


01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.920
some code together.


01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.800
And PyCharm's been really good to me from day one.


01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.560
I just really fell in love with it


01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.160
since I started using it.


01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.240
It has so many features that I need, especially


01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.880
as a full stack developer who is into a lot of web stuff.


01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.640
And I work on JavaScript and HTML.


01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.240
And I interact with databases a lot.


01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.480
So once you're thinking about writing--


01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:46.520
PyCharm has native support for Django and Flask


01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:49.200
and can really make sense of a lot of these files


01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.680
in ways that the other editors would need plugins and stuff


01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.600
to do.


01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.440
It just gets so much out of the box.


01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.520
100% agree with you.


01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.080
Absolutely.


01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.320
Yeah.


01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.200
Very, very cool one.


01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:01.080
All right, and then notable PyPI packages.


01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:04.560
What do you want to give a shout out to there?


01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:10.600
Well, we've mentioned a couple of the stuff


01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.000
that we've made here at Python Discord.


01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.840
I want to also mention that--


01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.640
so maybe that's a little narcissistic of me


01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.840
to talk about my own packages when you ask me this.


01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.440
It's all right.


01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.560
There's a lot of packages I really love out there.


01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:28.160
But you may not have heard of stuff like we have async Redis


01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.560
cache, which is this--


01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:35.880
we found out that working with Redis from an asynchronous


01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.000
context can be a little complicated sometimes.


01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.200
So we made this PyPI package that


01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.120
makes it extremely trivial to work with Redis from,


01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.400
for instance, a Discord bot.


01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.720
That's where we use it.


01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.360
So that if all you need to do is just cache some data in Redis


01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.480
so that you can access it later and use it as a cache,


01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.000
the way most people do, this is a godsend


01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.920
for working with it in an asynchronous way.


01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.120
Then I also have a personal project


01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.360
that I've been working on a lot lately called Blackbox.


01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.600
And it's in reference to the black box inside of a plane.


01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.200
So the idea is if there's a disaster,


01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.320
you get the black box and it has the stuff


01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:20.080
that you need to figure out what happened and get back on track.


01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:23.720
And so Blackbox is a backup system.


01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.360
It's designed to be extremely easy to work with,


01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.240
like abstract away all the painful stuff.


01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.280
And it's also designed to be really easy to contribute to.


01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.840
I've been working on trying to make


01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.160
the most contributor-friendly thing I can do.


01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.640
Big fat read me.


01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.320
Everything's like abstract classes.


01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.240
So if you want to contribute, you usually only


01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.960
have to touch a single file to write a single interface,


01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.160
basically, for the thing.


01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.720
So what it does is you make a config file.


01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.400
You put connection strings into that config file.


01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.360
So say you want to do a backup of Postgres.


01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.200
Well, you write a single string that's like Postgres,


01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.160
colon, slash, slash, the username, the password.


01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.520
And then you put that in there.


01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.280
And now it knows how to talk to Postgres.


01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:10.440
It does all of that stuff for you.


01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.240
So now you've told it a couple of databases,


01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.320
say Postgres, Redis, MongoDB, whatever you've got.


01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.960
Then you tell it, where do you want to store that backup?


01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.640
Maybe you want to store it in an S3.


01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.200
Maybe you want to store it on Dropbox or something free


01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.120
like that.


01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.320
Well, then you just put in another connection string


01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.800
that describes how to talk to that service.


01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.440
And then lastly, maybe you want to be let know when


01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.160
that backup has been done.


01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:39.120
So then you can put in a Slack or a Discord connection string.


01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:42.840
And it'll send you a message and say, ah, I'm done with my backup.


01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.160
So the goal is for people to just install it off of PyPI.


01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.640
And they can put it in a cron job or run it manually.


01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:52.280
And it'll just do the backup, store it somewhere in the cloud,


01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.280
and let you know when it's done.


01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.120
I love it.


01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:55.920
That's really cool.


01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.000
And looks like something maybe I could even make use of.


01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.280
I mean, I've got MongoDB, and I have backups for it.


01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.600
But this sort of fully automatic stuff would be cool.


01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.980
I've already got a Slack channel where I get notifications


01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.520
for deploys and whatnot.


01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.400
It could just throw in, hey, we did a backup next to that.


01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.280
Well, it's really easy to get started with.


01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:19.880
So some people have expensive, paid backup services.


01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.420
And they'll obviously be much better.


01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:26.240
Like saving a complete snapshot of the entire database server


01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.640
is going to be better than this.


01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.000
But if you're just looking for something quick and easy,


01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.840
maybe you just want to store it in Dropbox or something,


01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.080
this is a great way to have off-site backups for free.


01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.200
And you can set it up in 10 minutes.


01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:39.880
Very cool.


01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.720
All right, well, that's quite neat, though.


01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.480
Thanks for letting us know about that one.


01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:44.120
Yeah.


01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.360
Yeah.


01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.680
All right, well, the live chat is blowing up with lemons.


01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.800
[LAUGHTER]


01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.600
And bot commands about your beard and things like that.


01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.760
So thanks, everyone.


01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.920
But mostly just appreciation from the community,


01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.320
I think, so very cool.


01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.720
So final call to action, people are


01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.520
interested in being part of your community.


01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.520
What do they do?


01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.000
Right.


01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.840
So they can go to pythondiscord.com or .org.


01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.200
And from there, you get all the information


01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.120
you need in order to join us.


01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.880
There's also just discord.gg/python.


01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.160
That's us.


01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.880
Or you can even find it in the Python subreddit.


01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.720
So once you get into the community,


01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.040
you just ask around, and we'll help


01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.960
you get started with whatever it is you want.


01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.640
You need help.


01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.840
There's help channels to ask.


01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.200
And you join an event.


01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.360
There's lots of cool stuff going to happen


01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.520
in the next couple of months.


01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.760
Get involved in PyWeek.


01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.520
It's really fun.


01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.000
You write a game.


01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.120
Get involved in the Code Jam.


01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.800
It's a unique experience.


01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.280
And yeah, just come hang out with us.


01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.920
It's really-- it's a lovely place.


01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.420
That's cool.


01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.920
It sounds like some of these programming examples


01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:56.480
and opportunities might be more low-key, more silly and fun


01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.680
rather than forms over data.


01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.600
Yeah, yeah, exactly.


01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.360
Yeah, cool.


01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.360
All right, well, thanks for coming on and sharing


01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.400
what you guys are up to over there.


01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.120
And it's been great to chat with you.


01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.600
Oh, it's been my pleasure.


01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.840
Yeah, see you later.


01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.000
All right, bye, Michael.
