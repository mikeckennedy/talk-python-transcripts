00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Hello, YouTube.


00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello, Carol, Tina, Juan, Simon.


00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Awesome to have you here.


00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hi there.


00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey, it's good to be here.


00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey, Michael and everyone.


00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Good to be here.


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Yeah, it's really good to be here with you all.


00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And this is going to be a bit of a different episode and live stream for those who are


00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
watching the very popular live stream at the moment.


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There's been a, I don't know if you all have heard, but there's a bit of a turmoil over


00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
at Twitter.


00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I'm going to be talking about the fact that Twitter is a big part of the world.


00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I'm going to be talking about the fact that Twitter is a big part of the world.


00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I'm going to be talking about the fact that Twitter is a big part of the world.


00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's really good to be here with you all.


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.240
And this is going to be a bit of a different episode


00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.600
and live stream for those who are watching the very


00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.960
popular live stream at the moment.


00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.200
There's been a--


00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.080
I don't know if you all have heard,


00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.480
but there's a bit of a turmoil over at Twitter.


00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.800
And I think you could hardly hide under a rock and see that.


00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.300
Even the people who are living under a rock, like, oh, yeah,


00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.600
I heard about the Twitter thing.


00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.480
Because every news channel is just


00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.660
like they bring on the expert that talks about interviews


00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.920
and various things that are going on.


00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.040
And I wanna kind of start this episode


00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.200
just with a comment about Twitter real quick


00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.040
before we talk about the,


00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.860
maybe the alternative or destination or parallel universe.


00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.160
Twitter has been a really important community for me.


00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.440
And I don't wanna,


00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.680
if I say anything negative about what's happening at Twitter,


00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.540
I don't want people who have been really great pieces of my community, members of my community,


00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.460
to feel like that's in any way directed to them.


00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.940
It's been a really positive experience to be with so many people over there.


00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.420
And it's only with concern and worry that I would lose that community that maybe something


00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.700
might happen to Twitter.


00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.140
Either it gets wrecked and it's a place that people don't like, or advertisers flee and


00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.500
it goes out of business, or who knows what the future holds.


00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.620
But that's sort of what got me interested in alternatives.


00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.280
And Mastodon turned out to be a pretty interesting alternative.


00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.700
So maybe we could kick this off with just a really brief introduction and your perspective


00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.700
on that.


00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.540
Carol, we'll go down the video list here.


00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.540
Yeah.


00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.540
Hello, everybody.


00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.540
I'm Carol Willing.


00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.740
I'm a longtime contributor in the Python and Jupyter ecosystems.


00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.740
Now I'm a Dean of Engineering at Notable, which is a SaaS-based notebook platform.


00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.300
Yeah, I've been a long-time user of Twitter and it's been great for community stuff, but


00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.780
I am concerned about the future, so I'm interested in hearing what everybody else has to say as well.


00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.580
Yeah, well, welcome, Carol. Gina?


00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.080
Thank you.


00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.420
Yeah, hi, my name is Gina Häuske. I'm a full-time open source maintainer of my own project Octoprint.


00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.500
now for almost 10 years. And I think my Twitter account was created in April 2009.


00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.460
And my Mastodon account was created in January 2020. So I've been a long term,


00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:53.060
long time Twitter user, it was my go to social network after Google Plus went down. And I've met


00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.020
a lot of amazing people on there. And I really hate to see this, this community to, yeah,


00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.900
maybe go down now or something, I don't know.


00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.780
But in any case, that was also the reason


00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.300
why I jumped ship quite early and yeah, not jump ship,


00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.300
but just try to establish a new home, a new ground base


00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.380
and gather my friends around me there again, so to speak.


00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.220
- Yeah, yeah.


00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.780
So, you know, my feeling is sort of,


00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.420
my terminology I'm trying to use right now


00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.060
is sort of mass it on first,


00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.940
but not I'm deleting my Twitter account


00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.780
and I'm out of there.


00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.140
That's the way I'm thinking of it.


00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.660
- Exactly, I'm absolutely not deleting it,


00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.660
but I'm now, I switched the cross-poster direction


00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.660
and also the cross-poster, yeah,


00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.340
I switched it from opt-in to opt-out,


00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.460
from opt-out to opt-in, so yeah.


00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.420
- Yeah, excellent. Juan, hello.


00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.860
- Well, so hello everyone, my name is Juan Luis.


00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.740
I'm from Spain and since the past two years


00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.780
been working as an advocate, so the social media aspect has been really important also


00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.460
for my work, even though I've had a long-term love-hate relationship with Twitter in particular.


00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.580
So I don't remember when I first signed up because I have removed my account and then


00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:24.580
signed up again at least two or three times, but I very vividly remember lots of political


00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.300
things happening and following elections and important stuff happening not only in my country


00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.940
but everywhere in the world through Twitter and getting the news from there. So for me it's


00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.980
it's been a very important part of who I am as a member of the society and as a person concerned


00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:50.340
about the problems of the world of course and I'm also very sad to see it go that way. I have a


00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.900
story of working in the space industry as well, so I know how the new boss of Twitter operates,


00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:07.140
perhaps better than other people. But at the same time, I'm very hopeful for the future of not only


00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.180
Masterton, but the whole Fediverse, because in a way it seems like the very first time that we're


00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.620
trying this idea for a massive audience,


00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.260
not just a seemingly small number of people


00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.020
very concerned with free and libre software and so on.


00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.140
But we are experimenting with how this looks like


00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.220
for many more users than we could imagine two weeks ago,


00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.660
and probably much larger audiences that we can moderate as well.


00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.220
Yeah, in two weeks from now, it's going to be crazy different than now as well.


00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.020
There's so much action that people are going to find out, I think.


00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.980
Yeah, so you're in an interesting situation where as your job as an advocate,


00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.340
dev advocate, you've got to be on social media. You don't get to choose.


00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.660
And so you've got to go where people are and where the action is. So, yeah, welcome.


00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:10.340
Yeah, it's a whole conversation, like whether advocates should be on social media or if it's


00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:17.460
a requirement or not, but staying where the community is, is part of the job in a sense.


00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:27.940
Yeah, and you've also been on Mastodon. You're one of the old-timers, the old guard as they say


00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.100
over there. That's excellent.


00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.580
Been like a year and a half, so I wouldn't consider myself an old-timer, but I've been


00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:42.180
concern for about the Fediverse and alternative social media stuff for a very long time.


00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:49.300
Well, yeah, awesome. I kept the how long I've been on the Fediverse on my fingers and days.


00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.100
So, excellent. Simon?


00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:59.620
So, hi, I'm Simon. Yeah, I'm a full-time open source developer in Half Moon Bay, California,


00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.060
working on data sets, tools for data journalists and others to share and publish data. But I


00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:13.220
I've been on Twitter for 16 years, it turns out. I signed up in November 2006. I'm user number 12,497


00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.660
because back then Twitter had incremental IDs for their users, so I can tell you exactly where I was.


00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.740
And actually, I ran a startup built on top of the Twitter APIs for three years,


00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.180
which was then acquired by Eventbrite and moved us out to California. So,


00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.900
Twitter is responsible for a major piece of my career at this point.


00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:41.060
And yeah, I ignored the Fediverse entirely for five years because I understood the usability


00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.740
challenges around being decentralized and so forth. I'm like, you know what, Twitter works


00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.060
fine and it's a public company. What could go wrong? It turns out what can go wrong is the


00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:56.180
world's richest man can buy the company in a fit of narcissistic whimsy and everything falls apart.


00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.660
So right now I'm trying to find the alternative to Twitter,


00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.780
which cannot be bought by the world's richest man


00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.340
or bought by anyone else.


00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.420
And Mastodon appears to be in exactly the right state


00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.500
and exactly the right point in its development


00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.780
for this crazy moment in time right now.


00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.480
- That's awesome how much of an influence


00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.980
Twitter has had on you.


00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.620
You know, I was staying there.


00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.100
And like I said, I have this sort of,


00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.740
I'm gonna kind of be Mastodon first.


00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.180
I'm certainly not deleting my account.


00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.240
So staying is, I guess I'm still in a sense staying,


00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.240
but I was mostly focused there because my people were there.


00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.220
But as over the last week or so,


00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.620
what I've come to realize is, wow,


00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.620
Mastodon is way more in tune with open source,


00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.660
free software, unaffiliated tech organizations


00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.060
than any of the corporate big tech sites are


00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.420
in a very interesting way.


00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.060
- Yeah, the growth of Mastodon in the past week


00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.460
has just been astonishing.


00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.880
Like it's hockey sticking and it's all people I like.


00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.420
You know, I'm finding people on Mastodon


00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.380
who I didn't know who are great.


00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.020
Look, the many, many, many of the people I care about


00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.900
on Twitter are making the migration over as well.


00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.980
It just feels like it's, for my particular niche of nerds,


00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.840
it seems to have hit exactly the right resonance,


00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.580
which is really exciting.


00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.900
And the thing I've always loved most about Twitter


00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.120
is there are lots of subsets of Twitter.


00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.020
There's wildlife conservation Twitter and science Twitter


00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.660
and all of this.


00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.100
And they haven't all come over, but the scientists


00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.340
are there in bulk.


00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.300
The academics have moved to Mastodon in bulk.


00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.080
It does feel like Mastodon's not just


00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.940
going to be the kind of nerds who can figure out Mastodon,


00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.300
which I was worried.


00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.100
I was worried it would be people on Mastodon


00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.860
and nerds who want to talk about Mastodon.


00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.260
And that's so not the case, which is thrilling to me.


00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.700
Yes, that exactly was my concern as well.


00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.620
It might be a small little niche set of very techie people


00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.620
and that's great, but it seems I've had a bunch


00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.220
of filmmakers and journalists and--


00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.100
- Screenwriters are showing up, yeah.


00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.620
- Yes, it's amazing, it's really, really great.


00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.340
Let's see, a real quick question.


00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.300
This one goes to Juan first, David, out in the audience.


00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.300
So you weren't concerned with Twitter previously,


00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.600
only when Elon took over or,


00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.580
I guess it's more of a group question.


00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.860
- Yeah, David said it was kind of directed to me,


00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:25.500
but I will let others say their opinion.


00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.860
Yeah, kind of what Simon said already.


00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:33.220
I was also concerned about the idea of a whole entity,


00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.860
a whole media site being up for being bought


00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.780
by a single person, which might happen--


00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.460
I don't know-- for Facebook.


00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.120
it's already bought by a single person, right?


00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.120
In a sense, but it might happen


00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.840
to your favorite social network at any day.


00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.480
And the fact that now the Fediverse is gaining traction


00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.480
and it's distributed, puts some values to that.


00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.920
But apart from that, like Twitter has in a sense


00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.800
been a victim of its own success in the sense that


00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.800
like the algorithm, the famous algorithm


00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.800
that puts more famous tweets up front


00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.480
or things that you might engage with and so forth.


00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.480
In the end, it ends up favoring maybe things


00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.000
that make you angry because the algorithm knows


00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.960
that you're going to engage with that.


00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.880
- Oh, they really responded well to this one here


00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.880
where what about Nazis is so popular, let's share that.


00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.000
- Or Python versus Ruby, I don't know,


00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.760
like all sorts of things making you angry.


00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.200
but or maybe just silly memes that happen to be fun to watch,


00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.200
but I don't know, like making you lose some neurons.


00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.120
So I think my quality of life improved a lot


00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.600
when I switched to the chronological timeline,


00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.080
so when I disabled the algorithm.


00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.520
But I had to put lots of measures,


00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.720
like a browser extension that hides the trending topics


00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.440
and blocking people like there's no tomorrow.


00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.480
I don't know, like I had to develop my own habits


00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.880
to make Twitter sustainable for me.


00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.960
And Elon Musk buying it was just the icing in the cake.


00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.640
Yeah.


00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.720
It pretty much went the same for me, I got to say.


00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.400
So I started taking extended Twitter breaks,


00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.560
especially over the weekends when the pandemic started,


00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.760
and then even more so when the war started.


00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.920
And just because of all this negativity that constantly


00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.080
got flooded into your timeline, and I already


00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.680
was on the chronological one,


00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.240
and it still got flooded into there


00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.760
because obviously people who weren't


00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.360
on the chronological one got it via the algorithm,


00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.640
then they, I was about to say boosted it,


00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.800
but now they retweeted it.


00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.120
And that way, then it ended up in mine


00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.960
and I had to mute so many people.


00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.200
I had to add so many filters to my experience


00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.180
and all of that.


00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.360
I mean, in the end, I got a very filtered


00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.960
and very tame version of Twitter,


00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:19.040
it was still way before that guy bought it. It was way before that already, just another


00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:26.000
sink of my energy actually. And with Mastodon, I never so far have had, I've been very active


00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
on there ever since the first, "Hey, I'm going to buy Twitter" thing brought, yeah, happened


00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:40.480
I think April or so this year. And it was just like a completely utterly different kind of


00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:46.640
experience. Like, I met a number of people that I would never have found on Twitter, who I now


00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.840
interact with a lot because they are just genuinely interesting and do very, very amazing stuff. And


00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:58.480
there are capybaras and squirrels in my timeline way more than there were before on Twitter. So I


00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:05.680
enjoy that stuff and there is still the bad things and still the serious stuff and


00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.680
still the news but they are tamed they are not amplified to a thousand and that is really


00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.480
there's not an algorithm boosting it even more yeah yeah so i've got a different perspective here


00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:22.240
um i'm i'm gonna say something controversial i love the algorithm the thing i miss most from


00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.640
twitter on mastodon is i don't have the algorithm because the reason i love the algorithm is i


00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.400
I realized that it gave me the freedom


00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.880
to follow a lot of people.


00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.360
I'm following four or 5,000 people on Twitter.


00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.160
And the only way you can do that is you make sure


00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.800
you don't even pretend you're gonna read everything.


00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.720
And you trust that the algorithm will boost up a mixture


00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.720
of interesting things so that you can.


00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.760
And so whenever somebody says anything interesting


00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.380
at all on Twitter, I'll follow them.


00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.400
And then I'll hope that future things they say


00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.200
that resonate will bubble up.


00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.480
And for the most part, that worked really well for me.


00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.500
But it really came down to the fact that I trusted


00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.980
the sort of core concept of Twitter.


00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.060
I trusted that there were enough people at Twitter


00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.780
who understood why it works and what's important about it,


00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.620
that even while they play with NFT avatars and sleeps


00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.460
or whatever they call them, all of that kind of stuff,


00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.080
that the fundamentals were solid.


00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.220
And the reason, the thing that made me lose faith


00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.260
was when Elon, a week in, fired half the company.


00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.020
Like all of the people I know at Twitter


00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.020
who understood what Twitter was, they're gone.


00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.420
He's completely-- he's just gutted


00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.420
that sort of institutional knowledge of what this thing is.


00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.520
And then his first big change, the ludicrous selling verified


00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.260
checkmarks for $8, exhibited a complete failure


00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.060
to understand what this thing was and how this thing worked.


00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.900
And at that point, I lost all faith.


00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.820
I'm like, no, this thing I've trusted for 16 years


00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.460
to keep on working in a way that is useful


00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.180
and that means that I can follow my 4,000 people


00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.540
in weird different spaces, that's not going to hold.


00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.140
it's not gonna work anymore.


00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.620
And that was the point at which I switched my energies


00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.980
to Mastodon and found that most of the stuff


00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.140
that I loved from Twitter was happening there


00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.020
in a much more pure non-commercialized format.


00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.060
Like the commercial models are super worth talking about.


00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.900
But yeah, so my biggest Mastodon project that I plan


00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.340
is I want to build myself an algorithmic timeline


00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.740
that's just for me.


00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.240
And it means that it essentially takes everything


00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.540
from people I'm following and randomizes them a bit


00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.020
and looks for things that I might not have seen recently


00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.620
just tries to give me a little bit of that magic back again.


00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.940
- I kind of like that a lot.


00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.060
You're going to open source that, right?


00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.860
- Oh yeah, I hope so.


00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.580
- It's going to be a mess of SQL queries.


00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.420
It'll be lovely.


00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.620
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.


00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.020
I'll run on SQLite.


00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:32.860
It'll be amazing.


00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.860
- Oh yeah.


00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.700
- Yeah.


00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.620
No, I have to say, I kind of took Simon's approach.


00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.780
I didn't use any tools when I was using Twitter.


00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.500
It was whatever came up in my feed,


00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.860
it was the news of the day.


00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.660
And what was great is,


00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.500
I would see what Simon was up to


00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:53.460
and somebody else's cool bird pictures and whatever was going on in science.


00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:59.140
And, and so I had a very casual relationship with it, but it was something I looked at,


00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.700
you know, a couple of times a day and, you know, really learned a lot from.


00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:10.100
Now there was also the other side of Twitter, which is you get a community of people together


00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:18.100
where there's some anonymity and from like a core Python development standpoint and things where


00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.380
where there was controversy maybe within,


00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.680
you know, technical decisions that the language was making.


00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.260
Twitter could be a really yucky place,


00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:31.260
yuckier than mailing lists and Slack and IRC.


00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.540
Does anybody still use that?


00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.140
Probably, you know, but all of the other channels


00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.980
that we also follow.


00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.380
And I guess, you know, what I was seeing


00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.980
was more and more of my friends going to Mastodon


00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.380
and the people that I respect and like their opinions on.


00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.780
And I was like, you know, I've never been happy


00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.500
with the moderation side of Twitter.


00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.060
So let's see, let's see how this goes.


00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.420
But you know, I'm like Michael,


00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.780
really new, I can count on my two hands,


00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.620
like how many days I've been part of MassDone,


00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.060
but so far I'm super, super happy with it.


00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.140
So, let's see where it goes.


00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.460
- I'm glad to see you show up over there.


00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.660
That was great.


00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.500
- Cool.


00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:21.060
This whole conversation is going to be part, sort of the culture of tech communities, but also part


00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:28.260
technical as well. And I think understanding how Mastodon fits well with open source and those


00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:33.540
types of communities has a bit to do with understanding how it's deployed, how it


00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:39.140
connects together, how it works. Who wants to talk about what the Fediverse is and how do you create


00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.340
an account? Like, why are there so many weird different places I can go create an account?


00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.820
I'm like, what is this new world?


00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.300
I say, not mastodon.com,


00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.780
and I just go in and create my account,


00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.280
and it's like the new Twitter.


00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:54.700
- I mean, in a way, mastodon is a bit like email, right?


00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.540
- Yes.


00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:00.540
- Like you have an open, more or less well-defined protocol


00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.060
that is actually a W3C standard


00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.220
called ActivityPub and ActivityStreams.


00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.380
And in email, we have SMTP and IMAP and stuff.


00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.860
And you have servers on the internet


00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.000
that speak that protocol.


00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.260
Those are master.social, foster.org, chaos.social,


00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.500
and anything that you want to set up on master host


00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.620
and whatever.


00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.420
And the thing now is that just the same way


00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.440
that if you write an email from your Gmail account


00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.140
to someone who has their email hosted at FastMail


00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.900
or on their own domain,


00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.380
You can also do that with Mastodon


00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.940
because you can write a toot


00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.900
and we call these toots and not tweets.


00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.820
To someone, so I can toot to Mike.


00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.860
Mike is on Fosstodon.


00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.200
I am on chaos.social.


00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.460
That works just fine


00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.400
because there is a common protocol shared


00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.180
that both servers speak.


00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.380
There is even in the activity pub spec,


00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.660
a concept of an inbox and an outbox.


00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.880
So it is very email-like in that regard.


00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.020
And that just works.


00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.220
And that doesn't just work for a micro blogging service


00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.260
like Twitter or in this case, Mastodon,


00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.740
because when we talk about Mastodon,


00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.340
we also have to talk about the Feddy Wars


00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.380
and Mastodon is just a part of the Feddy Wars


00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.120
because there is other stuff.


00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.560
There is an Instagram alternative called Pixel Fed,


00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.140
same thing, opens your software,


00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.500
you can install on your server


00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.300
and then put your pictures on there


00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.440
and share them across to other Pixel Fed


00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.240
or even to other Mastodon instances


00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.840
because it's the same protocol.


00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.880
There is stuff like a YouTube alternative called PeerTube,


00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.800
same protocol, again, cross-compatible,


00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.800
can talk to each other.


00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.120
We have Bookworm that is a bit like Goodreads,


00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.340
by the way, written in Python,


00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.540
very interesting to look into the source


00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.440
if you want to get an idea how to implement ActivityPub.


00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.320
And yeah, there's a ton of other stuff too.


00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.120
So currently Mastodon is very big in focus


00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.680
because of this Twitter alternative thing.


00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.160
But when you start looking into this whole Fetty Wurst


00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.640
and this whole thing that powers Mastodon


00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.240
and how Mastodon works, then you realize,


00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.980
hey, there is a big, big world there


00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:18.980
beyond just sending toots and talking about squirrels.


00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.340
- And it's crazy how these different alternatives


00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.320
can communicate together,


00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.000
because have you seen when people share a tweet


00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.520
that contains a screenshot of an Instagram post


00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.120
that it's itself like a screenshot


00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.980
of something they saw on TikTok.


00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.560
So it turns out that you can communicate


00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.120
through all these alternatives with the same protocol.


00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.120
It feels surreal that you can, from Twitter, so to speak,


00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.880
follow an Instagram account


00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.160
and get their pictures on Twitter.


00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.540
It's like nothing we've ever dreamed of,


00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.480
and it's currently possible with the technology.


00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.800
Of course, it has like quirks and whatnot,


00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:03.400
But in a sense, it's like prohibiting world gardens


00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.720
for good and just interacting with any sort of social media


00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.920
with a unified protocol.


00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.460
MARK MIRCHANDANI: Yeah, there's nobody


00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.040
who controls whether you have a blog or not on the internet.


00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:13.540
Not really.


00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.040
So I want to throw some quick praise at Mastodon here,


00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.000
where I think the fact that this works as well as it does


00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.040
is a miracle.


00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.520
It is absolutely phenomenal.


00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.440
People have put--


00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.880
Mastodon itself is six years old.


00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.960
The activity pub standards are even older than that.


00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.200
A huge number of incredibly hardworking,


00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.440
incredibly smart people have sweated over this stuff


00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.760
for years and years and years.


00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.240
And I feel like we're getting one of those


00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.920
overnight success moments right now


00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.120
where overnight successes are always like


00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.200
five years in the making.


00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.240
Two weeks ago, we all started leaping onto this thing


00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.060
and it hasn't sunk.


00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.160
Like the fact that it's actually managing to scale up


00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.600
with this amount of activity,


00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.880
with a few glitches and some things


00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.000
are a little bit slow occasionally.


00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.880
No, I think this is an absolute miracle


00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.880
of software engineering.


00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.480
I could not be more impressed


00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.040
by what these people have built for us,


00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.280
this thing that we're diving on right now.


00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:09.000
It's just, this is an incredibly difficult technical problem,


00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.320
incredibly difficult social problem, the design problem,


00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.720
like designing community software is extremely hard.


00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.080
And they've done such a great job of this.


00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.800
And so you see people sort of complaining


00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.880
about little details and things are missing.


00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.640
No, come on, like we all just got here


00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.680
and I cannot believe what an amazingly rich


00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.600
and vibrant world they have created


00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.720
and something that technically works so well.


00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.680
And I'm just astonished by it.


00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.080
- Yeah, I love that perspective


00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.240
and I totally agree with you.


00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.520
- It should also maybe be added that some of the things


00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.280
that people complain about missing


00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.920
are actually intentional, stuff intentionally left out.


00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.240
So for example, a lot of people come on Mastodon


00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.600
for the first time and the first thing that they miss is


00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.760
where's the quote feature?


00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.520
Why can I not quote this toot and set my opinion on top?


00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.400
And that is intentional because the idea is that


00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.520
on Mastodon, you should not talk about people.


00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.200
You should talk with people.


00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.100
So comment on that thing, interact with that thing.


00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.200
You are free to just boost, so retweet,


00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.200
your response so that it gets more widespread visibility,


00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.920
maybe, but the first thing that you should do


00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.480
is interact with the person who wrote something


00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.600
that you want to discuss or want to add to.


00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.760
instead of just trying to be like, hey, look what I found.


00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.600
And all of this is now about me.


00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.600
And the other thing is that people miss a search.


00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.120
And I can totally understand that


00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.800
because the only thing that you can currently search


00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.960
is your local instance and maybe the federated timeline.


00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.600
And that is also intentional because the idea is that,


00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.420
yeah, so if you are on Twitter


00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.320
and you are a very, very bad person


00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.680
who wants to target a marginalized group,


00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.200
then you enter some keywords


00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.500
and you add those keywords as a safe search.


00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:58.080
And then you constantly and constantly and constantly


00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.540
just abuse the people who pop up with this keyword search.


00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.740
And you cannot do that on Astrodon.


00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.200
It simply is not possible technically.


00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.960
And that's a decision.


00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.340
- And I think it goes a long way to humanizing


00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.180
and re-humanizing the tools that we work with


00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.900
because it does give you this sense of,


00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:28.820
Hey, I'm not going to be as targeted, for something I say or do that is just


00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.260
part of my normal open source everyday world.


00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.940
But like Simon said, I mean, I think.


00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:39.180
You know, you've got these brilliant people coming together out in the


00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:46.460
open to manage a service that, you know, I have much more questions, whether


00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:51.340
not Twitter's going to fall over in the next month, the night June has to come.


00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.780
I mean, just, you know, and, and I guess some of that's the experience that I


00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:02.340
had with, you know, the federated version of mybinder.org and how we went from a


00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:07.140
small group of people, you know, hosting notebooks for free for the academic


00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:12.620
world and, you know, federated it out to other institutions to handle the


00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:25.060
capacity and it's worked out really well over the last few years. So, you know, I give a lot of credit to the folks that have been working hard for the last several years on Mastodon.


00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:36.340
I feel like we should talk about the business model, because Twitter, it's ads and selling your data and all sorts of stuff. The thing I love about, one of the things I love about Mastodon, the business model is just so open.


00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.140
It's like there are volunteers who are doing this stuff.


00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:39.740
They are volunteering.


00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.100
They're spending their time moderating.


00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.660
They're spending their money running instances.


00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.900
You should support them.


00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.020
Obviously you should, right?


00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:45.820
There's no advertisement.


00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.940
You can't use the thing for free and expect it to be paid for because


00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.820
then there are ads, there are no ads or anything.


00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.140
And I feel like Elon has set us the price, right?


00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.820
The price is $8 a month, right?


00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.860
That's what he wants us to pay on Twitter.


00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:02.340
If everyone who's using Amazon and can afford to do so puts an $8 a month


00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.740
towards their local, the server they're running on, it's going to be fine.


00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.860
it's just going to work.


00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.380
And we should all be committed to doing that, I think.


00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.100
I absolutely do.


00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.700
Let's talk about the instances, because I


00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.940
think the cultural aspect of the norms,


00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.580
especially that Carol was talking about,


00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.620
are really important here.


00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.740
And that also has a bit to do with the deployment.


00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:23.780
Now let me track down.


00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:32.260
There's an interesting place to begin finding an instance.


00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.100
There's-- how many instances are there now?


00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.100
4,000?


00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:35.940
Something like that.


00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.020
These are basically hosts for little communities,


00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.120
little islands of Mastodon.


00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.520
And there's this place called instances.social,


00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.960
and you can say, well, what language do I wanna speak?


00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.280
Do I care how many people are there?


00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.920
'Cause you might want a small community or a large.


00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.680
And you can say about what you,


00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.800
the type of content that you would like to be blocked.


00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.880
And then you could go search.


00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.520
I'm interested in open source.


00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.960
And what do you get?


00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.840
You get stuff, you get all these different,


00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.740
you know, Fosseton, for example, NixNet and so on.


00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.340
The one that I think is pretty interesting


00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.340
that I just recently learned about is Hackerdom.


00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.180
You know, Carol, I know that you're on there, right?


00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.620
- Uh-huh.


00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.820
- Absolutely.


00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.420
And they have a great, you know,


00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.140
Nova, very seasoned open source contributor


00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:29.260
who's done tons of work in Kubernetes and other communities,


00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.340
and they have a really open model.


00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.940
that's on GitHub, you know exactly what they're doing


00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.100
in terms of the community standards.


00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.060
And I started seeing friends of mine go there


00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.620
and I was like, hey, they're doing it right from the start.


00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:51.620
And I think that's something that to me is really important.


00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.100
Like, A, I know this is gonna be about as safe


00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.380
and open space that one can get.


00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.660
It's easy to know how to contribute back to them


00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.140
financially, in code, whatever.


00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:11.140
And you know what the rules are and the direction is.


00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.340
And I couldn't be more happy to be part of that.


00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.900
- My favorite thing about this server,


00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.860
you can see it on Twitch.


00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.500
So Chris Nova streams on Twitch


00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.180
and in the background is a rack lit up


00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.140
and that rack is Hackyderm.


00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.260
Hackyderm sits in her basement.


00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.700
It's got a fiber optic cable coming into it.


00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.620
It's a real thing, right? It's really exciting.


00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.140
You can touch it.


00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.140
Yeah.


00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.860
It's not in the cloud, it's on the ground, actually.


00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.340
It's in the basement.


00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.580
[LAUGHTER]


00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.900
Yeah, so when you come to these different instances,


00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.900
you can use instance.social to search.


00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.740
And then they each have, you know, this one,


00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.020
there's 6,000 active participants, however many users,


00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.740
and it has a mission statement.


00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.260
And that matters because they can control


00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.220
who can be on that instance.


00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.260
If you don't like it, go somewhere else.


00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.380
When you have conversations, there's a way to say,


00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.940
I wanna see the conversations,


00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.660
instead of happening on all of Twitter or all of Mastodon,


00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.860
I just want it on the people who belong on this small group,


00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.660
no matter how many others there are.


00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.060
I think it's really neat.


00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:15.900
- It's tricky though.


00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.820
Like this is, I think the biggest barrier


00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.460
to joining Mastodon is that on the moment you join,


00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.820
you have to make that decision.


00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.020
And it's a really difficult decision to make


00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.740
if you don't know your way around.


00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.260
And it's like, I couldn't make the decision.


00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.740
I ended up, I'm running my own instance.


00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.460
I'm paying companies to do it for me


00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.100
because I didn't want to have to choose.


00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.340
I'm like, no, I'm interested in everything.


00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.620
I don't want to align myself with the free software people


00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.660
or these people.


00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.900
I'm paralyzed by indecision.


00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.580
So yeah, so I ended up running my own server.


00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.980
It's cool that you can do that, but it is,


00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.060
I feel like when you're trying to encourage people


00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.860
to master Don, it is, this is the thing people need


00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.900
the most help with is this particular process.


00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.140
Because you're going in with no idea what makes a good server,


00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.940
but you have to pick before you can even start engaging, really.


00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.020
Yeah, it is tricky.


00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.980
Harley out in the audience says,


00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.940
"Could someone invite me to the one where the Python peeps are on?"


00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.660
Yeah, I'm not so sure you can get an invite,


00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.340
but, you know, Fosstodon, the free and open-source software,


00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.620
HackerDome, you know--


00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.260
I think there's five of us in this call,


00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.580
and we have five different servers, right?


00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.180
-Or almost. -Perfect.


00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.300
Yes, I think, yeah, that's right, we are, yeah.


00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.300
I think we're all on five different servers.


00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.980
But we still talk and organize this through Mastodon, right?


00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:29.700
Exactly.


00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.200
Exactly.


00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.420
This is a huge proof that the system works.


00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.380
In fact, I started on Fosstodon because it was, I don't know,


00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.100
more aligned with my interests at the time.


00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.300
But Fosstodon has a moderation policy at the moment


00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.300
that they don't allow non-English posts.


00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.580
And sometimes I just want to toot in Spanish.


00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.860
And so, yeah, I went on and created my own instance.


00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.380
And now I'm spreading my content everywhere


00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.620
in any language I like.


00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.700
But I think the moderation challenge is quite interesting.


00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.820
And I'm looking forward to someone to set up


00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.580
like a graph of people in a sense like,


00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.020
okay, you can invite someone,


00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.340
but if that someone does something nasty,


00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.660
then I'm going to ban them


00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.620
and I'm going to ban you as a result.


00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.460
- Gotcha.


00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.300
- Someone to keep track of the social structure


00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.360
of the network so that there's mutual accountability.


00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.820
I think that would be super interesting to watch.


00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:28.240
- Yeah, and these instances can ban other instances.


00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.640
Like for example, I haven't looked at Hackadam,


00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.840
but I know that Fosstodon is banning certain other instances


00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.760
for various reasons, because it's spam,


00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.720
or there's people who've done things that are unwelcome.


00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.200
So it's not just one person is banned,


00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.120
but like this whole community,


00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.120
we just don't want them to be part of it.


00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.920
Yeah, I'm not sure if that says,


00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.120
yeah, it doesn't say there.


00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.760
- I think Hackathorm has it in their GitHub.


00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.060
- Actually you can navigate, if you click about.


00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.720
- It should also show on the about page.


00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.560
Yeah, exactly.


00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.640
Click on the about page and then on more


00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.800
and there it should be.


00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.000
- I'll find it.


00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.520
- Wherever it was.


00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.360
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.


00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.200
Here you go.


00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.320
- Scroll down to the bottom and it's gone.


00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.160
- Ah, yeah.


00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.000
- A bit lower.


00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.820
- A bit lower.


00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.660
- Further, further, further.


00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.500
- Right there.


00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.320
(laughs)


00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.160
- Right at the very end.


00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.000
- There we go.


00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.600
- Limited suspended servers.


00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.440
- Yep.


00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.120
- Yeah, this one,


00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.600
found racism and questionable other badness,


00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.200
violation, violation, racism.


00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.880
One of these I saw just said Nazis,


00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.640
like, okay, that's clear, obviously.


00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.780
We don't want that in the limited.


00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.120
Yeah, so I think this is really important, right?


00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.240
Like this goes to choosing your home base, right?


00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.480
Because it's more than just what hosts your content,


00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.540
it hosts your norms and morals and stuff.


00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:55.700
Yeah, I think it should be made easier for people to migrate to other instances because


00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:00.080
at the moment, for some technical reason, I don't know, you cannot migrate your posts.


00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.400
You can only migrate your followers and stuff.


00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:08.120
So if people can just move around freely, it's not that much of a big issue.


00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.120
Yeah, I agree.


00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.120
I agree.


00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.120
All right.


00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.120
Let's see.


00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.680
There's some nice articles about choosing your own instance.


00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.040
There's that app.


00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.600
I guess one of the things why we're kind of on the culture


00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.720
side of things is, Simon, you talked


00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.680
about the value of the algorithm.


00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.800
And I agree with that.


00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.840
Acknowledging the filter bubble aspects of algorithms,


00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.560
there is some real value.


00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.760
So when you post messages here, because there's no algorithm,


00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.120
it becomes like tailing a log of a super busy website.


00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.720
just stuff screaming by and it becomes really hard to


00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:54.520
to sort of just interact in the general stream


00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.000
of information.


00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.540
So Massanon has ways to say like you reply


00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.360
but it's not really a public reply.


00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.520
It's sort of a semi, people can discover it


00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.760
but it's not announced.


00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.640
And I asked people, what is the right way in which to,


00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.400
what's the default way to reply to somebody?


00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.580
And most people said, I'll just hit reply in public.


00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.640
And to me, that seems like it's gonna


00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.320
kind of overwhelm the system of every conversation.


00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.560
- I believe replies in public will only get delivered


00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.120
to people who follow both you


00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.800
and the person you're replying to.


00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.040
So I think that's how that works.


00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.880
- Okay.


00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.480
Am I wrong about that?


00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.640
- I think public goes into the public outbox


00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.200
of the local timeline, local server as well.


00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.160
And so it also ends up on federated servers.


00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:47.560
So the general recommendation is, for example,


00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.440
for bot accounts to always set them to unlisted


00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.120
so they don't spam timelines,


00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.840
but can still be found naturally


00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.280
through hashtag searches, for example,


00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.700
which by the way, I think, contrary to full text searches.


00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:07.560
Unlisted is the thing where it still pops up


00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.660
in your followers timelines automatically,


00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.820
but it doesn't pop up in the public timeline


00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.420
on your instance, on the local one.


00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.900
So maybe we should say we have a local one,


00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.700
which is just the stuff on your server.


00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.720
And then we have the federated timeline,


00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.420
which is the stuff on your server,


00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.940
plus anything and anyone that interacts


00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.940
with people on your server.


00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.900
So that is a bit complicated.


00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.740
And I have not fully understood yet


00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.340
what exactly goes in there, but-


00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.180
- Right.


00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.940
- That is the two things.


00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.780
- I thought federated was anyone who's followed


00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.780
by at least one of the users on your server,


00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.020
but it's not because on my personal server,


00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.900
it's just me, stuff shows up in federated


00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.020
that's not from people I'm following.


00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.100
There's no one else in my service.


00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.940
So yeah, it's complicated.


00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.540
- I think if I boost something,


00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:58.300
I think if you follow me and I boost someone else


00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.220
or like a post from someone else,


00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.260
that is maybe a better example.


00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.100
If I like a post from someone else.


00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.940
- If you interact with it in any way.


00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.620
- I interact with that and that also means


00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.180
it will show up on your server


00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.660
even though you are only following me.


00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.500
- Okay.


00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.340
- I think it was like that.


00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:16.300
- I read into the activity spec, but yeah.


00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.180
- The fact that we need to analyze it so much


00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.180
and we still don't fully understand it,


00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.100
for me, it's a UX problem.


00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.000
I don't know if it can be solved by the technology,


00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.660
but no doubt it's a problem.


00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:33.660
And no amount of #fairytips is going to fix a UX problem.


00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.900
Like there has to be someone who would know it, I think.


00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.500
- Yeah, I went and I switched my defaults.


00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.380
Yeah, I set my default visibility to unlisted


00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.060
and I have to opt in the public on my world.


00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.620
So speaking of like changes that might be coming


00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.260
in the UX thing, so I did want to point out


00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.980
that Mastodon itself is open source.


00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.380
Obviously, Juan and Simon running your own,


00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:02.020
you're probably deeply familiar with this code over here.


00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.980
And they just announced that they're about


00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.060
to release version 4.0.


00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.940
I don't know what great features that's going to include,


00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.540
But hopefully some of these things get a little bit ironed out as well.


00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.940
I don't know if you all have any visibility into that.


00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.940
So it's a very active open source project.


00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.540
You can see it's got 2,600 issues.


00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.020
There's a lot of-- and it's been well-made.


00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:31.740
It's got people working on it full time, or at least one person working on it full time.


00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:37.540
Which-- and again, the amount of impact they're having from a very tiny team of contributors


00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.220
is truly extraordinary.


00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:44.880
But it does seem to be something where you can get very actively involved with it.


00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.100
There are also lots of interesting alternative versions out there.


00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:52.920
Andrew Godwin has spent the last two days hacking together his own custom mastodon on


00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.660
Django thing, which I'm really excited about because his signature feature is going to


00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.420
be that it will be easier to point custom domains to it.


00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.240
Right now, you have to run a separate mastodon for every custom domain that you want, which


00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.120
is very inefficient.


00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.880
where you'll be able to run one of Andrew's things and have all of your friends with their


00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:15.720
own custom domains can still share the same instance. But yeah, I also get a feeling from


00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.680
looking at it that there are inefficiencies in the way that it works, which are basically because it


00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:26.680
hasn't needed to scale that much before now. The way it distributes posts using sidebar queues


00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:31.960
and Ruby requests worked fine two weeks ago. Suddenly that's beginning to strain at the edges,


00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.160
but it means that if you want to help make this stuff more efficient,


00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.280
there is a--


00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.400
this is a great time to be getting involved in helping


00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.200
fix some of the UI things and improve some performance,


00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.360
and there's just so much work to be done


00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.520
and so many available people to help do that.


00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.320
So I'm expecting some very healthy activity


00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.080
around all of these different open source projects


00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.320
to be coming up pretty soon.


00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.920
- And I think because we're-- - Yeah, I wouldn't be--


00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.360
- Go ahead. - Oh, go ahead.


00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:04.360
I was going to say, because we're pulling in a bunch of different groups of people,


00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:10.440
I think the likelihood of getting more folks that are really into user experience and UI


00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:18.520
and how to run asynchronously things more efficiently, you wind up with these expertise


00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:24.760
coming into the ecosystem, which I think is going to continue to energize it.


00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.840
At least that's my hope.


00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.120
Well, we've got really good bones to build on.


00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.240
Like all of the decisions made so far are very,


00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.000
like it's a very high quality product.


00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.200
It's a very high quality code base.


00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.800
It's not like it needs fixing.


00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.880
- No, not at all.


00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.080
- It will definitely benefit from more people able


00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.080
to help it take on these newer challenges


00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.800
that are emerging just as the entire world


00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.320
leaps on it in one go.


00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.920
- Yeah, and I think it's sort of that


00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.480
you plug in user experience kind of side of things


00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.160
where you're gonna see the real growth.


00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.280
Maybe, I don't know.


00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.640
And about the new things in Maslow 4.0,


00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.160
actually, if you go to the release notes of 4.0 release


00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.320
candidate one, you can see that there's


00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.600
lots of new features that got added thanks to some funds


00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.160
from the European Commission.


00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.040
And then they're working on things


00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.720
like being able to translate posts


00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.720
or having more granular control on roles inside servers


00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:25.160
so that bigger instances can have any moderation roles


00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.520
that they want.


00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:31.240
I don't know, there's lots of exciting stuff coming


00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.840
for Massdown in particular, and I'm sure it's going to


00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.360
affect the whole Fediverse as a whole.


00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:46.040
Yeah, I can see a lot of new technologies


00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.480
being brought in here. This little scheduled background worker thing,


00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.920
we should maybe choose a different technology to make it go fast.


00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.440
Okay, let's see.


00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:03.440
So Simon, you mentioned Andrew Godwin's, is it Taq-Tah-Hay?


00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.920
- Taq-Tah-Hay, I think, yeah.


00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.880
- Yeah, so that's an interesting--


00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.120
- In which language is this word written?


00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.440
Is there any explanation of that?


00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.280
I'm curious.


00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.840
- I don't, I was guessing Hawaii, but I don't know.


00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.000
- It seems like that's the language as well.


00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.960
I don't know either, actually, yeah.


00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.800
- I don't know.


00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.360
I mean, to me, the bird evokes fanning out their wings


00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.680
in the distributed nature where he talks about--


00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.280
- It's a New Zealand bird.


00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.120
It's the sound wave. - New Zealand, yeah.


00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.800
- New Zealand flightless hen.


00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.840
That's a cute name. - A flightless hen.


00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.640
- Yes, I love New Zealand flightless birds generally.


00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.400
I might have to call mine Kakapo


00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.680
if I do a massive implementation


00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.640
just to keep Andrew's naming convention going.


00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.440
But yeah, Andrew's developing this entirely in the open.


00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.320
I'm finding this useful because I have plans


00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.340
to build my own code around this,


00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.000
I'm gonna steal his implementation of like the HTTP signing


00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.700
and all of the difficult bits that he's figuring out.


00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.280
This looks very exciting.


00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.460
- Sure does.


00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.020
- Signing is actually fairly simple.


00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.640
The problem is how do you address anything


00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.500
that you're supposed to send out?


00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:20.380
Yeah, I have a little pet project brewing now


00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.700
since the start of this year,


00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.780
or rather like the end of the last one,


00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.860
and that is activity-focused.


00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:29.060
So I was also working on that stuff a bit


00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.540
in the background and it is a lot to take in,


00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.580
but it is fairly clever all in all.


00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.100
- Absolutely.


00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.900
- If you want to see how the stuff works,


00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.820
so I'm running my own instance.


00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.220
I'm playing mastodon host to do all of the work,


00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.060
which is great.


00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.140
I don't have to figure out the docker containers


00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:49.980
and so forth.


00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:52.300
But when you have an instance of your own,


00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.020
you get access to the admin panel.


00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:57.340
And one of the things in there is the sidekick queue view,


00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.300
which shows you what's been queued up to go out.


00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.700
And it turns out anytime you send a toot,


00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.900
it needs to be sent to every server


00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.700
that at least one of your followers is on.


00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.420
I've got like 5,000 followers


00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.780
who are spread across 580 servers.


00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.100
So if I toot, that's 580 deliveries that need to be made,


00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.540
which is on the one hand,


00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.420
that sounds like a pretty giant


00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.460
and intimidating amount of traffic.


00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:24.020
And if you watch, if I get into a conversation


00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.540
and send a bunch of toots, my queue can grow


00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.960
to like 10,000 items and take like 20 or 30 minutes


00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.600
for it to fully drain through.


00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.940
But I started thinking about it and thinking,


00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.940
you know what, if I load a web page


00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:38.660
and open up the network pane, it makes 100 requests, right?


00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.360
Pages are pretty inefficient these days.


00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.220
So actually sending 600 requests because I tooted,


00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.580
by modern web standards,


00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.740
that's not really an enormous amount of traffic.


00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.060
And this is why I feel like


00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.300
there's some low-hanging fruit here,


00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:54.220
just in terms of more efficient sending of these requests.


00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:57.100
This is where Andrew's built using Python async I/O


00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.860
for his implementation, which feels to me


00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.780
like the right kind of technology to apply here.


00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.300
But yeah, it's really interesting


00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.580
just having those little insights


00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.660
into what's going on under the hood.


00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.480
And there is, this is not,


00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:12.020
it's a lot more complicated than running a blog.


00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.300
If you're hosting your own blog,


00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.820
there aren't that many moving parts.


00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.180
If you're hosting a master on server


00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.380
or an activity server,


00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.700
there is a lot more activity


00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.300
It has to go on under the hood for all of us to work.


00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.780
- On GitHub, right here on GitHub,


00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.860
it's a 66 requests to pull up a readme.


00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.740
- Yeah, there we go.


00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.340
- So something like that, right?


00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:37.940
Let's go back here, not there yet.


00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.900
Oh, so one thing I wanna talk about,


00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:46.060
we go over to the various profiles


00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.860
and I'll pull up my register sec.


00:45:47.860 --> 00:46:01.860
One of the things I guess, one of the things that's a little bit annoying here is if you search for yourself and you've done anything somewhat notable on social media, you're going to find multiple ones of you.


00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:13.860
Look, there's three of me. And if I look for like JetBrains, there are many. None of these are real accounts. They're all, all fake, right? And yet there's many.


00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.860
There's many Twitter barrels, actually.


00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.340
Yeah, exactly.


00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.260
Yep.


00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.140
I searched for Carol. Oh, there's only one Carol. Amazing. So good.


00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:26.340
Yeah, thanks. Thanks. You've added me now.


00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:33.380
No, I mean, look, there's four Simons. And, and so the reason I bring this up is


00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:40.020
you have to do a little bit of work not to pay $8 to get a red blue verified sticker.


00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.220
but to establish your presence and show that you're a real person.


00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:51.060
So for example, on my profile, I have one well-known domain that's verified,


00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.100
and then it links over to like talkpython or pythonbytes.


00:46:54.100 --> 00:47:00.100
And those are both, if I were to go to them, they also have verified.


00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:05.780
Verified, not paying money, but go through the protocol or the conventions.


00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.740
So who wants to talk about that?


00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.500
like talk about this sort of creating a verified account


00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.340
here.


00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.900
- So I think it's a very smart technique.


00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:20.500
It's very similar to how you verify a site on Google search.


00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.760
For example, you say, okay,


00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.740
so let's configure some DNS with a special record


00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.100
that only you know.


00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.500
And then when you do that,


00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:32.300
then Google knows that this site belongs to you, right?


00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:36.940
And the way you go and do that here is that you go to these


00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.700
URLs that you control,


00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:43.700
and then you add a backlink pointing to your mastodon profile


00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:47.780
and somehow the system does this update for you


00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.980
and those links appear as verified.


00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.440
And I think it's really interesting first


00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.540
that you don't need any technical special thing,


00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:59.840
you don't need any blockchain or anything like that


00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:00.680
for it to work.


00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.380
Like as long as you trust that talkpython.fm


00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.700
is by Michael Kennedy,


00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:11.340
then you can assume that the Fostalon account is


00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.380
going to be properly verified.


00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.140
And at the same time, it sets a very good precedent


00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:20.820
for news outlets, for example, to create their own instance


00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.500
and say, look, we're going to verify our instance.


00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.500
And you know that anybody with an account here


00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:31.080
is either a journalist of ours, or it's us, our official voice,


00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.180
and so forth.


00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.980
So it provides a way of doing this distributed,


00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.660
inexpensive verification.


00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.260
And I think that's really, really interesting.


00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.780
- And there's no central authority that says,


00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:46.580
we hereby confer upon you this check mark, right?


00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:50.540
It's, here's the evidence I present that I am me


00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:53.020
or that Talk Python is Talk Python or whatever.


00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.700
And that gets verified and people can decide


00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.060
how much they trust that.


00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.700
- I just love this 'cause it's such an elegant solution.


00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.420
And it's so funny with Twitter verification


00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.420
being this complete trash fire for the past two weeks.


00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.260
And well, the question is--


00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:09.340
- It was bad and now it's really bad.


00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.180
- Yeah. - Right.


00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.300
And then on Mastodon, it's like,


00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.820
oh no, you put a rel=me link on your site back


00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.380
and you highlight the domain and that's done.


00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.220
I think it's beautiful.


00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.780
I think it's a really clever.


00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.980
There are some interesting tricks with it.


00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:23.820
So like I've got a GitHub account.


00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:28.740
GitHub will use rel=me only on the about URL field


00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:29.700
on your profile.


00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.780
So, and you only get one of those.


00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.300
So you can link back to your account from GitHub


00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.620
and get a verified thing.


00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.420
But then I wanted that to point to my regular site.


00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.420
So I edited it back again,


00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:42.060
which actually breaks because my server knows


00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.980
that I'm verified 'cause it happened to check


00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.260
while that link was there.


00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.500
But then other people's servers don't show that verification


00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.220
because they all check independently as they should, right?


00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.700
Nobody should trust my server about the verified links.


00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.620
They all need to do their own little verification step.


00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:59.020
It's also, when you look at the activity queues,


00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.900
There's a whole lot of activity that's just checking


00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.460
these verified links from each server


00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.500
to make sure that they're there.


00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.580
But I do think it's a beautifully simple


00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.580
and elegant way of solving this problem.


00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:13.740
- And then of course you can add like a blue check mark


00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:17.580
next to your name, just a little bit dope, right?


00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:19.180
Nobody prevents you from doing that.


00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.620
I actually did that.


00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.460
I'm really proud of it.


00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.260
- There's a ton of people who have colon verified.


00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.540
I don't know if I can pull that up.


00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.540
Yeah, they're like this.


00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.380
Oh yeah.


00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.620
(laughing)


00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.340
- That's server specific though.


00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:33.300
- Oh, is it okay?


00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.860
- Emojis, yeah, yeah.


00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.260
I think that doesn't work on mine,


00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.400
or at least I haven't seen it on accounts on mine yet.


00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.740
But it's okay.


00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.180
- AxelWax out there says you can put it


00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.220
in the location field in GitHub as well.


00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:48.140
Do you have an example of that?


00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.620
That'd be great to see what you're talking about.


00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.100
Let me pull up.


00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.340
- Oh, I don't think you can put URLs in the YouTube chat.


00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.700
they will be featured out.


00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.540
- Yes, you're right.


00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:58.380
Of course they will be.


00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:02.260
- And probably the geographical location field?


00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:07.260
- Maybe on your user's location field in GitHub, maybe.


00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.220
- Yeah, maybe.


00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.540
All right, well.


00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.820
- I still hope they will add just some weight


00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:14.060
at arbitrary stuff.


00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.540
Sorry.


00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.140
I still just hope that GitHub will see the light.


00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:22.060
- Yeah, go Gina, go.


00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.100
Sorry.


00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.020
I just hope that GitHub will see the light


00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.020
about the importance of Mesterdon verification


00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:30.100
and allow us to either add a Mesterdon account there


00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:34.100
or just, you know, like more than one homepage link


00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:36.620
with an, well, equals me thing there.


00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.740
And I've poked them a bit, but so far, sadly nothing,


00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.100
but I'll keep poking them.


00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:41.940
- Yeah, Axel Wax points out that, yeah.


00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:42.760
- There's an open issue of that


00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.740
or a conversation somewhere, right?


00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:49.820
I saw that the other day, but I didn't collect the URL, so.


00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.340
Yeah, I pinged them on the internal Slack.


00:51:55.340 --> 00:52:00.000
And X-Wack said, yes, the location field.


00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:00.840
- Yeah.


00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.040
And so there's a couple other things I want.


00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.660
Yeah, interesting.


00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.820
There's a couple other things I want to follow up on here


00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:09.760
before we go.


00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:14.760
And Dina, this one might be particularly relevant to you.


00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.080
Here, let me put this in.


00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.520
So apparently the German government


00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.240
has set up its own Mastodon server.


00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.600
You probably know more than I do about this.


00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:30.440
- Yeah, they created this social.bund.de


00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.800
and yeah, more and more ministries and official places.


00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.400
So what you see there in the screenshots is the,


00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.360
or was the, so the BME Bund,


00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.660
which is our Ministry of Inner Security and such,


00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:47.880
and then yeah, data protection, freedom of information.


00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:54.360
my own county, as I just said, also, or rather my own state actually also is apparently now there,


00:52:54.360 --> 00:53:00.360
the Hessische Landtag, so hey, cool. And yeah, they started doing that around the time that Elon


00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:05.640
bought the thing. So two weeks ago or three weeks, I don't know, maybe the server is older,


00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:13.320
but the influx of a ton of official accounts started. Yeah, something around that time. And


00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.920
And what I also recently learned is,


00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:19.200
so we have this international emergency broadcast thing


00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.360
that is not SMS based, but rather an app.


00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:26.760
And I don't know how official that is,


00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.860
but there is also a server dedicated to just subscribing


00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:34.720
to the so-called NINA notifications for your location


00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.120
so that you get a Mastodon notification


00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.720
when there is some kind of emergency,


00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.800
like really bad weather, or I don't know,


00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:46.520
Some some bomb that was found from world war ii again, which also happens all the time here


00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:52.520
and that is kind of neat that they integrated that so I I immediately followed my local


00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:57.000
A little terrifying though because that means makes matters in a safety critical system


00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.400
You know when my queue's backed up for an hour suddenly i'm getting nervous that these messages really do need to be delivered in real time


00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:10.360
As you're looking at the rubble warning earthquake coming oh wait, yeah, but no this is this is a really really cool


00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:14.360
I absolutely love this idea.


00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.960
And I think other governments should also


00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.040
consider this seriously.


00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.940
Now, two more areas.


00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.160
We're getting short on time.


00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.480
I want to make sure we focus on.


00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.160
First, a little bit of programmability.


00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.320
Yeah, it's this.


00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:33.040
So there's a thing called Toot and a Python library


00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.160
which you can program called Toot.


00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.760
So Toot, the Toot CLI--


00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:39.760
Is that what it's called?


00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.640
This is yep.


00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:46.440
This is it and it's a full on.


00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.740
It's well, I know it's like.


00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:51.320
Mass it on in the terminal,


00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.440
right, which is pretty interesting.


00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.920
But it has a Python library.


00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.640
Has anyone done anything with this?


00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:58.640
Not yet.


00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:03.360
Now I've been playing with the API


00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.440
directly 'cause massed on your local.


00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.520
Your server has an HTTP API.


00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:12.520
It's super, super, it's a very clean, very well designed API.


00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.800
One of the things it can do is it's got a streaming API.


00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.680
So you can hold open a connection to a URL


00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.400
and every time a new toot comes in,


00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.760
it gets fed to your script.


00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.080
So I've got a, I wrote, I have a little script to the gist,


00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:27.000
which I've just pinged you in the private chat,


00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.760
which listens to my server


00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.160
and writes to a SQLite database


00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.720
every time something happens.


00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.520
And then I can analyze it in data set


00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.080
and run SQL queries and so forth.


00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.520
This is going to be the basis.


00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.360
Here we go.


00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.200
So this right here.


00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.560
And if you look at the code,


00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.320
and you scroll down,


00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.000
so you went Python stream.py and give it a database.


00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.040
That's the schema.


00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:46.880
And this is the whole thing.


00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.720
It's what, like 30 lines of code,


00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.680
'cause all you have to do is stream against


00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.440
that Feddy.sign_listens on that API


00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.120
that you want to stream in public.


00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.640
And then every time a new line comes in,


00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.680
treat it as JSON and write it to the database.


00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:01.720
This is, so when I talk about building my own algorithm,


00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.720
this is how I'm gonna do it.


00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.480
I'm gonna be sucking all of that data down


00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.440
into a little SQLite database


00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.400
and then running SQL queries against it.


00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.760
I was really impressed at how easy this was.


00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.040
Note that I don't even need an API key for this one.


00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.720
This is just a publicly available endpoint that I can hit.


00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.800
But it has authenticated APIs for following and tooting


00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.880
and all of that kind of stuff.


00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.400
So yeah, this is very, very hackable.


00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.400
And one thing I find exciting is,


00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.480
so I've built Twitter bots in the past,


00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.800
and it always feels like you're in a ask permission


00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.400
or ask forgiveness situation.


00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.600
Now you launch a bot,


00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.680
and you're always crossing your fingers


00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.180
that somebody, the powers that be might not go,


00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.640
"No, that's a bad bot," and turn it off for you.


00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.440
Mastodon, there are no,


00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:42.400
like you can run a bot on your own instance.


00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.440
If you misbehave, the worst that can happen


00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.800
to your instance will be defederated, which is bad.


00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.680
So don't do bad bots.


00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.800
But you can build a bot that does absolutely anything.


00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.560
And especially if it only interacts


00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.980
with people who follow it, what's the harm, right?


00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:57.520
Nobody's gonna get upset with your bot for spamming people


00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:00.040
if people had to follow it to get alerts from it.


00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.080
So I think we're gonna see so much innovation


00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.200
around bots on this platform,


00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.960
because it's so easy and liberating


00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.160
to start writing these automations.


00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.680
- I absolutely agree.


00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.560
I checked out, I keep losing track of where I am.


00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:19.000
I checked out to, if you look at the PyPI listing,


00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.440
it just gives you a description,


00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.400
and if you click on, take me to the documentation,


00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.480
it takes you to the documentation for the UI thing.


00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:30.000
It's really not clear how to use it,


00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.080
but I ended up just doing basically what you said.


00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:38.480
And I used to create the OAuth registration


00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.920
and the access keys and all that.


00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.800
And then I just wrote some straight Python code


00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.560
using HTTPS against the API.


00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.120
And now on my stream deck, I have a little button.


00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.020
I can press right here.


00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:52.900
Every time I wanna announce that a live stream is starting,


00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.920
click that thing and off it goes.


00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:58.360
And so programming, like you said, is pretty hackable.


00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.080
- This is just so cool.


00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:00.920
- Yeah, yeah, this is fun.


00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.520
This is real fun.


00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:05.480
- I'm looking forward to the dataset plugin for this


00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:09.200
because I think that would be pretty darn cool.


00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:12.520
And congrats on the five-year anniversary, too.


00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.700
- Thank you, yeah, it was the project's birthday yesterday.


00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.400
Yeah, no, I want to do a plugin.


00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.640
I'm waiting for Andrew in Tag Tech,


00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.520
I pronounced it correctly earlier and I'd forgotten.


00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.480
I'm waiting for Andrew to solve all of the problems


00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.280
and I'm just gonna copy and paste code out of that


00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.120
and build a plugin.


00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.720
and build a plugin based on the things


00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.000
that he's already figured out.


00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.960
But yeah, I want Dataset to be able to both ingest


00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.680
from ActivityPub and publish to ActivityPub,


00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:37.160
all via plugins.


00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:40.480
It feels like it would be a really natural fit, definitely.


00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.320
- Yeah. - Yeah.


00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:46.040
So I guess maybe let's close this out with,


00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.280
not that yet,


00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:52.280
though I wanna close this out talking about funding


00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:55.860
and how, I mean, you mentioned the business model.


00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:02.600
I think it's so transparent. It's like there are no ads. This is volunteer run. It's volunteer money


00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:07.060
If you can afford you think you should pay and I think we should all be paying eight dollars a month for this on


00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:11.180
Principle if we can afford to do so, I think that's the right the right amount to commit


00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:16.560
Yeah, they let me see. I pulled it up here perhaps where I pull this up


00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:22.640
It's a little hard to pull it up on social.co op. For example that works as an open collective


00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:29.820
project. So to become part of it, you have to pay and it becomes a collective effort that way. And


00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:38.060
I think that's really interesting too. >> That is very interesting. Yeah, I know if I go back here


00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:44.780
and I click on announcements, I'll get there. There we go. So I only read this about the


00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:52.540
Fauceton. So look at your instance of interest, I suppose. And if you look at this, they have a


00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:56.780
funding page over here, and they actually have open numbers


00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:01.100
about how much it costs to run, how much scaling


01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.260
they've had to do recently.


01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:05.980
So it said two weeks ago, we paid $100 a month,


01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:09.100
and now we pay $1,000 a month.


01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.300
And here's how much money, so how much runway


01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.900
we have at this current rate.


01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.540
They also talked about how many users


01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:18.580
they had in here somewhere.


01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:22.980
it went from something like 2000 to 40,000 in a week,


01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:26.120
which is pretty interesting.


01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.100
But if you think about this,


01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:30.300
like, so they need $1,000 to run this server


01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:31.440
and this infrastructure,


01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.700
and they actually break it down by piece of infrastructure,


01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.020
like CDN versus servers.


01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:43.020
And you take 40,000 and 1,000 divided by 40,000,


01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.820
you know, that turns out to be like 2 cents a month


01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.780
to run this.


01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:55.420
I mean, we can have a world that's not, you know, infested with ad companies and algorithms


01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:00.740
that are trying to manipulate us to buy things or to vote this way or that way, or to be


01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.180
angry about this cause or that cause.


01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:06.580
For 2.5 cents a month, that's insane, right?


01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.580
We should absolutely be doing this.


01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.340
That's just a cliche, right?


01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:15.540
The old cliche is if something is free, if the product is free, then you are the product,


01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:17.220
you're the thing being sold.


01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:21.860
is our chance to show that we understand that lesson, right? This is right now we want to use


01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:25.700
this software, we have the option to pay for it, we should pay for it. And like I said not everyone


01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.300
needs to pay for it. I like the eight dollars thing because if you can afford it then throw in


01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:33.860
that eight dollars. People who can't afford it we want them around anyway so let's cover the costs


01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:39.460
for them. But yeah I'm not worried about the financial sustainability of this of this thing.


01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:44.260
If even a small minority of us do the right thing and help pay for it I think it's going to be fine.


01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:54.820
And I think it makes good sense for the ones that want to be sustained long term


01:01:54.820 --> 01:02:00.980
to be very transparent with the finances. I know we did that with mybinder.org and that really


01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:08.980
helped with either grant money or bringing on other federated instances and I think it gives


01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:16.500
people like, hey, you know, people are putting in their time, as well as the financial resources,


01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:22.180
you know, I for one, I'm happy to pay for that I would pay more than $8 a month,


01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:28.660
just so that, you know, there's no ads. In fact, I do on certain services. So, you know,


01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:36.820
but, you know, I think the other thing to maybe keep in mind is, given how quickly it's growing,


01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:40.820
and the fact that there are maintainers of Mastodon itself,


01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:46.620
be kind to those maintainers as you want new features and things,


01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:49.020
because having been on the other side of,


01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.620
"Oh, you don't have this, this is a stupid way of doing that,"


01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.620
you know what, they made good decisions,


01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.620
those were the decisions they made,


01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:02.120
and support them as they learn how to scale even more.


01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.940
So don't forget that there's people behind the efforts.


01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:07.940
Yeah.


01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:13.700
I want to also point out that just because they have more money than it costs to run


01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:19.900
at the current moment, Mike and I don't remember the other person who runs Fosstodon and this


01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:23.700
goes for all the servers, these people are taking a lot of their time.


01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:30.300
They said there's been so much of an influx, a 20x growth in users and servers and so on.


01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.900
It's been almost like a second full time job.


01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.480
So I think we should consider, how do we make it something


01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.040
that is not a tremendous unwanted burden


01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.600
for these people who put together these places for us?


01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.520
So, all right, like it shouldn't just go,


01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.960
well, they need a thousand, they got a thousand,


01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.800
they're good.


01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.900
It should be something more than that to help them grow.


01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.900
- We are technically minded people.


01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.260
We can volunteer our time,


01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.460
people like volunteering to help with moderation,


01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.200
volunteering to help with systems administration.


01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.160
These are all things that we should be ready to do as well.


01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.760
- Yep, absolutely.


01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.640
Yeah, at the same time, I think the technology will only improve.


01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:14.200
Andrew Godwin just created Django asynchronous Fediverse server in, what, seven days.


01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.160
That's completely astonishing.


01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:23.400
But the more the technology evolves, and I think it's happening now, that the human problems are going to become more and more apparent.


01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:31.160
And probably some instances will want to have full-time moderators or even part-time, and they will want, I don't know,


01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.300
like marketing people, graphical design, communications.


01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.540
They will want to coordinate with other instances.


01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:42.540
They will want to fund progress in the activity pub protocols


01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:46.940
that it's more robust and more feature complete, whatever.


01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:50.660
So like the more money we pour into the ecosystem,


01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.740
I think it's going to be good


01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:55.060
if there's a good accountability


01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.740
of how this money is spent and so forth.


01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:01.220
And if it's as cheap as two cents a person,


01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.100
let's just go for it.


01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.540
- Yeah, yeah.


01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.140
Why not, right?


01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:10.100
They have Patreon and also not just your instance,


01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.220
but Mastodon, the bigger org also has a funding option.


01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:19.080
Yeah.


01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.060
All right.


01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:23.660
Well, I for one think this is a really lovely place to be.


01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.340
I'm excited by what I found.


01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:30.060
And I saw a lot of comments in the live stream


01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:34.680
here that people found the signal to noise ratio much


01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.760
higher over in Mastodon.


01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.040
People felt very welcome there.


01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.880
The kindness was really apparent there.


01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:46.720
So I didn't end up here for the reason that I expected.


01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.960
As Juan pointed out, some narcissistic guy


01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.560
went and banged around on Twitter for a while,


01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.560
tried to break it.


01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.760
We'll see how that turns out.


01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.600
But I'm really glad that I ended up here.


01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.080
So yeah, it's very cool.


01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.080
All right.


01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:04.120
Well, maybe we'll go top to bottom.


01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.120
Yeah.


01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.640
Final thoughts on this.


01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.640
Carol?


01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.640
Yeah.


01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:14.440
I mean, I think it's a great alternative to have in our ability to communicate.


01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:22.120
I hope somebody who knows it well writes a good onboarding experience for those of us


01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.640
that are relatively new.


01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.740
It wasn't hard to get started, but there were a lot of decisions that maybe aren't quite


01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:33.380
apparent when you first approach.


01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.540
Gina?


01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:44.940
Yeah, I think we will probably see some changes maybe here and there as more and more people


01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:51.260
go in there and need to first get, yeah, get get into the into the way that we talk there


01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:56.140
into the way this whole how this all works, how the community rules are and all that. So I think


01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:02.700
there might be some bad things that will happen sooner or later, the bigger this is, this stuff


01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:08.620
gets. But I think the community as a whole so far has shown that in theory, it should be


01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:16.140
ready for that and should be able to solve that. And it Yeah, big, big parts of how to solve these


01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:21.020
situations are, issues are already built into the very protocol, into the very concept. So


01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:31.180
I have high hopes that this is here to stay. And it, yeah, it feels like Twitter back in 29,


01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:35.900
or even, I don't know if anyone else still remembers this, but before there was Twitter,


01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:43.900
I was on Identica, which also was something like, like Mastodon basically also federated,


01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:51.180
if I remember correctly. I'm not 100% sure. And so, yeah, it feels a bit like the internet used


01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:57.980
to feel, and I really enjoy that as an old-timer, basically. Indeed. Juan?


01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:06.300
Yeah, so, same as you, Michael. I'm so glad that the Fediverse and the Mastodon community so far


01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:12.700
is so friendly in general. At the same time, I'm looking forward to having more conversations about


01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:17.820
What's next? What are the current challenges? What are the bottlenecks that are perhaps limiting


01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:25.660
adoption somehow? Are we prepared for the next influx of users? I don't know, if Twitter collapses


01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:32.220
effectively next year, is the Fediverse ready to take that amount of users in? Do we want


01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:37.740
that sort of thing? I think there's lots of questions to be asked, but at the same time,


01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:43.260
It feels so exciting that we're in a position to do that from a community perspective,


01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:49.180
with a distributed responsibility way of doing things.


01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:55.260
And, well, I'm not deleting my Twitter account just yet.


01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:56.940
I will keep it around just in case.


01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:00.860
But definitely, I'm Mastodon and Fediverse first now.


01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:05.900
I really want to have all my favorite people, all my favorite projects,


01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:14.260
Tooting from the Fediverse whatever instance they they land on and and yeah, very excited about the future


01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:17.940
Yeah, I completely agree with you. Thanks Simon


01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:22.140
I've got a call to action people toot about nice things


01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:24.540
Something I've been doing every day


01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:29.040
I try and put up a message about one of my projects which I do hash


01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.980
Projects on and I'm encouraging other people to do exactly the same thing


01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:36.740
It's like celebrate things that we've built I try and if you click on media


01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:41.680
I try and post a wildlife photo every day as well tagged with wildlife photography


01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.900
Because who doesn't want to see a photograph of a pelican in there in their feet?


01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:51.520
Does that your dog have a mastodon feed not yet? No, I haven't moved


01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:57.140
She hasn't moved everything to it yet, but she should do and we're not upset. Yeah, she's still just sticking with that group


01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.320
She's she's not a she's a bit old-fashioned on that front. Yeah, but yeah


01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:05.800
I'm post post nice things reply to people get involved like the one of the things that we're all enjoying about


01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.160
Mastodon is that people are nice to each other and talk about interesting things.


01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.840
So get on there and talk about interesting things and be nice to people. That's the best thing that


01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:20.640
we can be doing right now. Yeah. And I just want to say thank you, Simon, for the project hashtag,


01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:24.880
because I have had a blast reading through that and also participating in that. Excellent.


01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:33.840
Fantastic. It's really fun. Yeah. Yeah, totally. Yeah. And I'll be sure to link to everybody's


01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.040
Mastodon profile so you can follow all the guests,


01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:37.960
as I always do.


01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.800
But I think that's especially relevant now


01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.480
that everyone's coming over.


01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.680
It's a little bit different to find folks and connect.


01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.520
But my experience is Mastodon is very active, very


01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:56.120
full of Python people who are friendly and excited to be


01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:56.620
there.


01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:57.880
And so it's a great place.


01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.800
It's not just a couple of people who are there.


01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.240
It's a great community, and folks should check it out.


01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:09.840
All right. Carol, Gina, Juan, Simon, it's been great to have you all here. Thank you


01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.840
so much for being part of this.


01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.080
>> Thanks for having us.


01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.080
>> Thanks to you.


01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.080
>> Thank you for having me.


01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.080
>> You bet. Bye, all.


01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.520
