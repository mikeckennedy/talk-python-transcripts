If you're involved in science or use computational tools in your work,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.080
you should be using code to solve your problems. On this episode, we have Dr. Becky Smethurst,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.820
who is an astrophysicist at Oxford University and uses Python to explore galaxies and black holes.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.760
Learn how she's using Python to make new discoveries at the cutting edge of research

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.500
and dive into a couple of her YouTube videos aimed at spreading scientific truth in an

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.040
entertaining rapper. This is Talk Python To Me, episode 303, recorded February 4th, 2021.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:46.180

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.100
It's so great to have you here. Yeah, it's great to be here. I'm just happy to have a

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.480
chat about code on a Thursday afternoon for me. One of the things that I like to do is I like to tell

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.240
stories of people doing amazing stuff with Python, not making Python necessarily their entire world,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.940
right? Like it's awesome to talk to the people maybe at Instagram and how they're building Instagram

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.960
with Python. But I think it's also really neat to shine a light on people doing other things like

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.220
astronomy or economics or whatever, but also, you know, using Python as a superpower. And it definitely

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.960
get the sense that that's kind of your world. Yeah. It's fun. Like thinking about not just all the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.220
things that you can do with Python, but like humans in general can do the things that I am doing

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.600
with Python, like that we've figured all of this out, you know, that we can then use a tool like

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.340
Python to do it. It kind of blows my mind that I get to do that every day. In your world, there's

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.940
probably a lot of supercomputers and high-end, you know, there's a lot of stuff behind the scenes,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.520
behind maybe a simple Jupyter notebook, right? Yeah. Just a little bit like the Oxford physics,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.540
like a supercomputer is called Glamdring as well. Like everything's Lord of the Rings references.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.960
Okay. Awesome. So these like conversations you have with other physicists in the department being

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.640
like, Ooh, did you, did you get time on Glamdring? Like how did you get hands on Glamdring? Like it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.600
makes it sound like we're passing around this sword between us all like that.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.080
That's amazing. And I, you know, we're going to talk a bit about your YouTube channel and some stuff

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.820
that you're doing there as well to popularize astronomy and whatnot. And one of them, you talked

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.820
about how at Oxford where you're working, there's actually some of the scenes from Harry Potter

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.500
shot as well. So there's all sorts of cool fantasy movie tie-ins here, right?

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.460
Yeah, definitely. So Oxford has them, the colleges and my college Christchurch is the one they used

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.580
in the first film for the steps up to the hall where like Trevor finds his toad and McGonagall welcomes

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.060
them and stuff. So the amount of times I've walked up those steps and like quoted parts of the film,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.440
because I'm such a Potterhead. But then also I managed to somehow get past the referee on one of my

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.960
scientific papers to name galaxies after Harry Potter characters.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.240
Oh, fantastic.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.840
Because like when I was at the telescope taking the data, I was highlighting them like red,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.040
blue or green, depending like whether I was observing them on like Tuesday night, Wednesday night or

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.240
Thursday night. And so I named all the red ones after Gryffindors and all the blue ones after Ravenclaws

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.300
and all the green ones after Slytherins. So yeah, I ended up with, you know, writing a paper that was

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.000
like Hermione shows interesting features. It was great.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.840
Oh, that's fantastic. I love that. Let's kick off a little bit of background about you with a comment

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.720
from live stream. Robert says, I like Dr. Smether. She reaches for the stars. Fantastic. So maybe tell us

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.600
a bit about yourself.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.000
Yeah, sure. So I am an astrophysicist. I work at the University of Oxford at Christchurch and I research

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.800
how supermassive black holes affect galaxies. And that's sort of like my day job. And that includes,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.500
you know, going to telescopes and taking data, coming back, analyzing that data with Python and then

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.920
writing it up and publishing it to the world. But then sort of was like a side hustle, I guess you could

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.820
call it. I have my YouTube channel where I like to just chat to people about space and astrophysics and

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.500
all the research that's going on in astrophysics right now, because I think there's often a disconnect

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.140
between the public who are like, I think so many people are interested in space in general, because

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.340
it is one of those things that there's just an abundance of questions that we don't know the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.800
answer to. And that's why we're still doing the research. And so everyone is so curious about it,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.940
but they don't have a friendly neighborhood astrophysicist to ask the question too. And that's

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.620
what I, you know, try and be for people and highlight, you know, what it's actually like

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.300
to work as an astrophysicist. Because I think a lot of people don't really know that it can feel sort of

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.860
very opaque, sort of the academic world of research and being a scientist. But then also, you know, being

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.280
like, oh, there was this new research study published, what does it actually mean? Why do we

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.260
astrophysicists care? Like, what implications does it have for, you know, our field in general? How does

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.020
it fit in? All those kind of things and really combating as well, like the rise in the sort of,

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.820
you know, conspiracy theory science on YouTube as well. I feel like if we just flooded YouTube with like

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.880
real scientists and real academics actually doing the research, you know, that know their stuff,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.380
then I guess we can combat that.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.940
Yeah. So that's amazing. Two thoughts. One, I think astronomy is interesting because it's both

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.880
so close to everyone, right? You go out at night and you just look up and you can't help but go,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.040
wow, I can almost see the craters on the moon. Like it's, it's right there. And yet at the same time,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.420
it's also super inaccessible, right? Like if we want to study, you know, Newtonian physics,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.220
we can throw a rock and watch the parabola, but we, we can't really access the stars in that way,

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.820
or even the planets other than, you know, they look like stars themselves, right? Basically,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.260
unless you get a proper telescope.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.460
Yeah, exactly. There's so many steps that go from just using your eyes to observe the night sky to

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.680
stepping through, you know, buying binoculars, buying telescope, buying a, an adapter that can

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.700
adapt your camera to a telescope that you've bought to, you know, putting together loads of lenses of

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.820
cameras to make a telescope or going to then like a professional, you know, telescope that's built

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.300
with these incredible detectors that let us see the faintest of faintest of features. And with that is,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.040
is where we can start doing some science. But, you know, I say even in the 1600s, what, you know,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.060
400 years ago or so people were still doing naked eye astronomy and learning things about the stars,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.580
or even just with, with binoculars or telescopes, you know, a very small telescope that's maybe less,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.280
less than a hundred quid, a hundred dollars. You know, you can see the moons of Jupyter and you could

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.380
night by night, every time it's clear, go out and sort of show, okay, the four brightest moons of

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.640
Jupyter are here, here, here, and here around Jupyter. Oh, the next night they've moved. Oh,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.280
and the next night they've moved again. And that's a project you can still do at home. And okay, yeah,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.460
we might understand that, but that would be one way that you could test gravity or, you know,

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.900
test the positions of Jupyter's moons. Or even people, a guy called Olber used one of the moons of

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:11.240
Jupyter to work out the speed of light 200 years ago. So there are, there is still stuff you can do,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.200
but yeah, it can feel like, you know, it's not accessible to the things that we're doing in

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.020
terms of black holes or dark matter or anything like that. You do need, you know, seven years of

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.880
education or whatever to be able to grasp that and do research yourself. But I guess that's why I want

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.400
to be on YouTube. It's kind of saying, okay, you don't have the seven years of maths and physics

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.740
behind you, but here's the gist of it. You know, here's what they're saying and here's what it means.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.860
Amazing. The other thing I wanted to mention or get your thought on is you point out that there's

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:46.580
all this misinformation and it just boggles my mind. I just cannot comprehend how we live in a time of

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.240
so much accessible information. And yet there are people, you know, there's a guy in the United States

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.080
that was convinced the earth was flat. So he built a rocket, shot himself up in there to disprove it,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.880
and then crashed and died, I believe.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.300
Yeah.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.880
Because he was like, yeah, I got to prove it's flat. All these people keep telling me this,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.700
that it's not. And you know, it's so good on you for putting out like interesting,

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.620
compelling science for people to learn about.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.840
Yeah. I think it's also just like really getting out like the process of science. Like

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:20.020
you collect evidence, you test an idea you've had, but if the evidence doesn't match that,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.120
you have to change your ideas. And I think that's where people get stuck on science is that they have

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.300
some emotional attachment to an idea like the earth is flat. They can't change their mind when

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.640
presented with evidence that isn't. But it's the same thing where people are like, oh, I've never

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.800
really liked the idea of dark matter. So I'm really skeptical of it. You know, like it's the same thing.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.140
It's like, well, you know, you have to look at the evidence. And as begrudgingly as astronomers

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.420
eventually came up with the idea of dark matter after ignoring sort of the evidence 50 years,

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.140
you know, that was sort of something that is like when you understand the history of all that stuff

00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.420
that's built up, it's very easy to see why we think what we do. And I think that's something I try and

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:06.020
focus on to try and combat those sort of like science skeptics or, you know, people who have

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:11.360
emotional attachment to stuff like that. And this misinformation is the how we know, not just what

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.020
we know. Cause I think that's so important.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.780
Yeah, absolutely. I know there's a lot of stuff going around this, like this whole coronavirus era of like,

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.080
well, the scientists said this, and then they changed their mind and they said something else

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.440
after further research was done. So they must have no idea what they're doing. It's like, no,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:31.780
that's called science ideas. And then you follow up. All right. So let's get into some of the coding

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.600
topics a little bit here. You know, before we get too far into it, you know, how do you get into

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.600
programming in Python? Out there on the live stream, I also have a sort of similar question,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.100
maybe tie them both together. It's how do you learn Python for astronomy as an intermediate

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.740
program? I have an intermediate Python program. So any advice for me to get

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.500
better to apply Python to physics?

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:55.220
Yeah, sure. I didn't even come across coding or Python until I was at university. So it must

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.720
have been my second or third year. There was actually Python courses as part of the physics

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.700
course, you know, teaching it you from scratch, basically. I never learned it at school because

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.040
it just never crossed my radar. Like I did what would be the equivalent of sort of like IT

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.780
computing for what we call our GCSEs up to when we're 16. But that was like Excel spreadsheets

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.900
and like Word docs. It was right, right. More like computer fluency stuff. Yeah.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.960
Yeah. The practical exam was like a three hour practical exam. I think I finished it in an

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.040
hour and I was just like, oh, it's just an Excel spreadsheet. So I wish we'd done something

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.080
like that then because I think it would have prepared me better because so much science is

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.800
ingrained in Python. And it was great. The introduction we had at university because we learned the basics.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.180
But then, you know, the next minute you were like, okay, so code up Einstein's theory of

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.220
general relativity because there's just the laws that you follow and do that around a black hole and

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:46.660
look at, you know, the, how the strength of gravity changes as you get closer to it. You know, that was

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.700
something that was really cool to be set. And that it sounds so complicated to try and code up, but it's,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.320
you know, it's like a couple of functions and, and then you don't kind of things. Yeah. I found that so

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.620
difficult at the time. But looking back now, I'm like, that was so simple.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.740
Well, I, you know, thinking back to the code that I've written, I remember being so just thrilled

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:10.840
and satisfied of getting some simple little program working. And, but it seemed like a giant achievement

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.340
at the time. And, you know, it probably fit on one screen or whatnot, but that's how it is when you're

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.440
learning. Right. Yeah. I mean, even just like being like, what is a terminal, you know, print,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.600
hello world. Like, what is this? I remember that being such like a mammoth, like obstacle to get over

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.080
of just like getting into like the language and everything like that. But that comes from just

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.880
immersion right in it. And the same thing is true for, for learning how to apply Python to

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.620
astronomy or to physics. It's immersion in both the language that's used in astronomy and physics,

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.800
but also then the coding modules that are so useful to you, like Python modules, for example,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.980
I'm just going to shout out the AstroPy consortium now, because they're incredible. It's this,

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:54.540
this whole open source project that's developing, you know, everything from how to, you know,

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:59.040
plan your observations if you're using a telescope. So you give it coordinates of an object and it's like,

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.340
this is when this is visible in the sky, you know, to, you know, then reducing that data or

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:09.080
converting, you know, a redshift to an age of the universe, for example, like something cosmological,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.920
like, you know, that people would be writing their own little widget, like HTML widgets for like about

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.080
10 years ago, but now is so ingrained in the Python and Astro stuff.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.080
Yeah, that's fantastic. It's, you know, so much of it seems like it would be very,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.440
like a huge challenge, but these days, it may be 20 years ago it was, but these days it's,

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.300
you know, grab this package, call that function, know what it does, right? And then grab something

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.480
out of AstroPy or something in Jupyter or Plotly or Altair and off you go.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.700
Exactly. So I would definitely, if anyone wants to get into it, definitely recommend starting with

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.140
the AstroPy project because they have so many tutorials and everything, because it's all open source

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.160
that they're all probably Jupyter notebooks as well. So it would be a great sort of jumping off

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.260
point to get involved. Say, you know, want to get into astrophotography maybe,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.500
and you want to reduce your images, clean them up with Python. That would be a really fun project to

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:53.660
do.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:58.560
Yeah. Fantastic. Quick, maybe a related question from Frey out there is, do you use basic Python

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.080
or is there a special AstroPy version? I think that's interesting.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:06.060
No, it's the usual Python. You know, there was a big sort of like collective, like,

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:11.380
oh, change to Python 3.6 or 3.7, whatever it is during the AstroPyps community when everyone's

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.140
stuff broke, but it's the normal basic Python, just complementing,

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.700
by the AstroPyp package.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.520
Yeah. I think that's one of the powers of Python. And maybe you could speak to this from

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.800
your slice of science, but I think this is why Python is so popular for computational science

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:32.420
in general, is that it's just Python plus, right? And it's so accessible. You can start out with a

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.640
very simple program, add to it, add to it. And you never think of yourself as a programmer,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.940
but all of a sudden you end up with functions and a package. You're like, what am I doing? How

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.680
did I become a programmer? Right?

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.580
Exactly. Yeah. I think that's the thing about programming though, is as long as you have a

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:50.140
task, you're rolling, right? You know, you're on your way to becoming that. It's almost like not

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.740
knowing where to begin or not knowing what to do with it that sort of scuppers you. So yeah,

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:59.560
it's sort of weird that you can do so much with Python. It's so flexible for, you know,

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.920
data tables, but I can also pull in an image that I've taken as well. Or I can,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.520
the idea of NumPy as well is just an absolute lifesaver. Like the fact that I can,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.260
you know, the fact that it's like row and column manipulation, you can do something across the

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.680
entire array. Like I have images that are arrays, right? So I can do something across the entire

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:23.000
image with NumPy like that. Yeah. It's just, it's so easy to use. There are some tools in astrophysics

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.840
that, you know, we have languages called IDL that were really developed.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.260
Right. Specifically for astronomy. Yeah.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:35.380
Yeah. And I find IDL hell, sorry, excuse my language, but like I find you run it and it does

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.040
a different thing the second time you run it. And I'm like, why?

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.940
It should not do that.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.700
It shouldn't, no. And then like IRAF as well, which is a similar thing that was developed,

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:48.860
but they're just, they're not as intuitive and easy readable as Python, I don't think. And so I

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.220
think that's why Python has really took off in the astronomy community.

The next question I always ask my guests after introductions, what they do day to day, but I

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.840
kind of want to anchor our conversation around your YouTube channel on these cool videos you put out

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:11.440
there. So not only do you have an answer for that, you have an incredible video you put together.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:18.900
So yeah, an 18-minute video you put together, a day in the life of an Oxford astrophysicist. And

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:24.460
basically, it's like a time-lapse with commentary, right? Maybe you want to just talk about,

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.360
you know, summarize that video for people? Yeah, sure. What do you do day to day?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.680
I get, because I just got asked this question so much, like, what do you actually do? And I just

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.780
figured the easiest way was to show people. So I show people everything from, you know,

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.620
leaving my house and getting on the train to arriving at the office and lunch and all the

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.380
things in between kind of thing. So there's a mixture of, you know, me doing everyday things

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.920
like checking emails. That's almost part of it. Communication between your colleagues to say,

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.020
oh, I've got this new result. I've got this new plot. Oh, can you read my paper? That's cool.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.300
Checking all the new research that's been published.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.260
Sorry, you literally have like the time-lapse of, say, you at your desk and you're like,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.920
oh, that's on the screen. I must have been doing this right now. Oh, now I'm doing this

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.920
something in Jupyter. And now I'm off to this.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.440
Yeah, exactly. So there's bits of me working with Jupyter and definitely like doing, I was doing a

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:13.880
little test of my hypothesis because I had some new data that came in. I then went to a talk that was

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:19.780
given by a visitor to the department who was one of the leads in the Event Horizon telescope that made

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.360
that picture of the black hole, the orange donut, as people call it.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.940
That was such huge news. A couple, was that last year?

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.080
A year before, 2019. That's crazy.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:27.800
Yeah, 2019.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.720
But yeah, so that was really cool to show people that, you know, that's part of our day. We,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.080
you know, go to talks and listen to people present their science. And then also, you know,

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.040
I happened to be on the radio that day. I picked a very exciting day.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.200
So I was like, oh, keep going on the radio.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.040
It seems so glamorous. Like, oh, wow, this person is probably going to win the Nobel Prize. And here

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.120
I'm on the BBC for a while and back to lunch.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.000
There was just lots of bits in my day that were, and then also like we have a big, what we call a

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.040
journal club where we bring a research paper that's been published that week. And we go through it

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.360
in our research group and talk about it to find out, you know, how it fits in with our research,

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.800
that kind of thing and what it means. And I get a lot of my ideas from videos from those kind of

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.820
journal clubs as well. Cause I'm like, you know, we talked about it as colleagues and then I'll make a

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.840
video on it to sort of say, well, this is what we found cool this month kind of thing.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.880
It just showcases the whole day, but then also a little bit of, it's why it's an Oxford astrophysicist

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.080
because it's also like, we also took the speaker to college dinner, which is like a very fancy

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.820
dinner and a nice room. And we all got dressed up and had drinks and stuff like that. It's like

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:29.560
very Oxford, but it showcases that side of it because that like, you know, networking side

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.460
of things. So there's, there's code in there. There's, there's a talk, there's lunch,

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:38.100
there's dinner, there's everything. So yeah, it seems fabulous actually. Yeah. Yeah. It

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.340
seems really great. So, one question, I guess one quick meta question and then one

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:49.060
other question. So how did you film this? Like, is it just eight hours or 12 hours of full on high

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.960
res video or it wasn't the high res cause it was on my old iPhone. So it was like seven 20 P.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:59.960
So it wasn't that high res. I think it was, yeah, I cleaned my phone basically of pretty much

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:05.380
every picture and video and backs it up and then literally just carried it around and a little

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:10.780
gorilla pod all day, plonked it on the desk and then like took it with me wherever I went. And I would

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.540
stop it sort of, if I was like leaving the room, I would sort of set a new file going. So it didn't

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:20.540
like break or anything. And it was like permanently plugged into like a charging block as well. Cause it

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.700
was like an old phone running out of battery constantly. I, yeah, I just took it everywhere and I felt

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:33.020
stupid doing it just carrying around being like, hi, yeah, sorry. I'm filming. But like, it was,

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.540
people were always asking me what I was doing everywhere I was going and people like loved the

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.900
idea of it. So. Yeah. It seemed really interesting. I actually thought you did a great job with it.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:47.140
So the non-meta question is what did you learn about yourself by, did something surprise you?

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.920
You're like, Oh my gosh, I had no idea. I remember thinking this was quite a full day,

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.760
but it didn't feel like I was rushing around or doing anything. I just think when you watch

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.920
something in time-lapse, it feels so busy. So all the comments were like, Oh my God,

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.760
she does so much in a day. Like she looks so busy. And I was like, I didn't feel that way kind of thing.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.960
But like, I felt like I was like, cause there's a part of it where it's, it's filmed like mid November

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.380
and the Christmas adverts for the, all the big, you know, like department stores had just come out in

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.260
the UK. And I, there was a part of it where I just caught myself watching one of those.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:23.340
And I was like, stop wasting time in your day on like Twitter or watching videos, you know? So

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:28.140
there was bits like that, I guess that I learned that I was kind of like, gosh, that's literally

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.920
sort of like so much time. One thing I did find though, is that I was very productive because my

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:37.540
phone was always recording. I couldn't just pick up my phone and scroll or anything because it was

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.200
always filming.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.600
Instagram or whatever. Yeah. Interesting.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.280
So I had quite a productive day because of it.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.800
Oh, interesting. All right. Well, let's go ahead and jump into sort of the main topic

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:53.440
here is the reason that you caught my attention as maybe a guest for the show is you did this really

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.760
interesting video, you know, five ways that I use code as an astrophysicist. I think this relates

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.860
back to that superpower. You know, Python has a superpower, not we should take all the people that are in

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.140
finance or math and turn them into programmers, but you know, people that have interests, give them some

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:13.960
other thing. And you really touched on how programming is so valuable, but it's not necessarily

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.780
communicated to that when you're in the sciences. I did a math degree and I don't remember really

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.680
till maybe my senior year in college when they're like, you really need to learn programming. That was

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.180
just for a research project, right?

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:30.040
Yeah. I was the same. Like, I think I was given various different projects that were like graded in

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.280
my second, third year. And then in my fourth year, I was given a research project on galaxies and it was

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:39.560
like, you're going to need code to do this. And that was when I finally became comfortable using it.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:45.260
And you realize, oh, I have, you know, thousands of galaxies. I don't have to do this in an Excel

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.060
spreadsheet. There's a better way. And, you know, if you have images, you have to analyze, oh, I can do it

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:54.980
in the same function. I can do it in the same, you know, you know, piece of code or whatever. And,

00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:01.960
yeah, I think that's not communicated how much and how many different ways you are going to end up

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.060
using it and how many ways it just makes your life just generally easier to use it.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.760
Right. I mean, there are problems you could solve without writing code.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:14.060
If you know how to do it, there's no way you would spend half an hour doing something by hand. Like,

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:18.260
you know, we just write a little program and in three minutes have this done ever and ever,

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.760
you know, every time over and over. Yeah.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:24.120
Yeah. There are things that I've picked out in my day that I've been like, I do this nearly every

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:29.060
day. I should just write a function for this. Yeah. And you just save yourself so much time.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:34.160
I totally agree. There's certain things I have to do at work and my business. And I'd just be like,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.220
this is so painful. I can't believe I have to do this. And I, why have I not stopped to just write

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.640
a program that does this? This can be automated. Why, why have I done this for three months and,

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.760
you know, suffered over and over. And then, you know, I'm just endlessly happy when I take that.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.040
So let's cover the five ways, right? Like you've already set the stage of why

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.880
people in science in general and astrophysics in particular should care about these things.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.080
But what are the five ways?

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.120
Oh, it reminds me what order I put them in. I can't actually quite remember.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.000
I got them here. So the first one you gave was image processing.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.320
Yeah. Okay. So this is a big one for astronomy, obviously, is that we, you know,

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:14.320
I am an astrophysicist and an astronomer. So I take images of the sky and then use them to do my

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.600
science. There are some people who are very theoretical. So they'll either run

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.360
computer simulations or they'll work with sort of the maths. And so they don't really tend to do that.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:27.820
But as an astronomer, I take images of the sky and I have to analyze them. So for one thing,

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.280
you have to remove all the sources of noise in the image. So that's essentially just,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.600
like I said before, it's a numpy array, right? Because all you've recorded when you've taken

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:40.660
an image of the sky is how bright each pixel is. And so what you want, say you're observing,

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:45.580
like I would be, I would be observing a galaxy. In my image, I would have the light from the galaxy,

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:52.140
but I would also have background light from just the sky in general. So like light from the sun

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:58.220
that's scattered around the atmosphere and then hits the detector, but also just noise that comes

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.480
from the detector itself. So the detector thinks it's detected light, but it's actually just that

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.080
it's a little bit warm, for example, you know? Okay.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.480
So the way it does it is light comes in, pings off an electron from in an atom,

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.600
but that can happen if the atoms are just a little bit warm.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.180
Yeah. Yeah. You give an example of even if you close the shutter and have no light at all,

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:21.120
it kind of looks like a backlight. We were young, the TV channels, you know,

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.540
you had like that antenna, not the cable, right? It's just like that fuzz.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.880
Yeah, exactly. It looks like fuzz. So you have to remove all those things from your image if you

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.620
just want the image with galaxy left over at the end. So there's clever ways you can do that. Like

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.560
you said, you just leave the shutter closed and you get an idea for what the noise looks like

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.840
for that detector. You can take an image of just like sky and then you'll work out, okay, well,

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.600
that's the noise I need to remove for that bit and everything. And again, it's just numpy, right?

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.300
It's just taking them all out. And sometimes you'll also have cosmic rays that come in and hit your

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.880
detector. So that's really super high energy radiation. And it looks like just a little sort of

00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:01.220
super bright pixel, maybe three pixels. Like they're just like, and if they're off to the side,

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.580
it's fine. You just, you just take them out. But if they're right on top of what you want to observe,

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:09.300
that's so annoying. That's where the exoplanet transit was supposed to be. What's going on?

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.640
Yeah, exactly. Similarly with like satellite trails as well, which is obviously becoming a

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.940
bigger issue with sort of the SpaceX constellations and everything like that as well.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:23.860
Is there going to be some kind of AI type thing that just goes, I now detect SpaceX satellite transit?

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.840
Stop observing. Yeah. I think that's hopefully the sort of moving forward is that

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.000
more will be shared between astronomers and sort of the people who are manning those big

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.660
constellations of satellites. Cause it's great what they want to do. They want to bring internet

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:40.460
to the farthest corners of the world, which is always great in my book, moving everything to space

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.620
in terms of astronomy is just not feasible. Like the money it would cost and everything. And like the

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.600
fact that you can't fix them if something goes wrong, if they're in space, you know, we still need

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.040
telescopes on the ground. And so if there's some form of, yeah, like you say, an AI, that's like,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.340
warning SpaceX satellite trail coming. Like you just sort of stop your observation and start off

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:03.040
again. But yeah, we don't have that at the minute, you know, so you sometimes do get a satellite trail

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.300
that's snuck in there and you have to remove that. And it, and it, it's so easy to do with Python.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:12.520
Again, AstroPy, there's loads of functions in there that help you out as well with removing so that the

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:17.840
detectors aren't always perfect either. So they have a response function, we call it where, you know,

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.540
they'll have some efficiency of like 95% in the middle, but it will drop off at the edges.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.260
And so you'll have to account for that as well in the processing of the image, all those kinds of

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.760
things you can use Python to do.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:34.460
You've got to somehow adjust what the telescope sees and retrofit that to try to be as close to

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:34.940
reality.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.320
Yeah.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.880
Not just what the picture says, right?

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.880
Yeah. And there are sometimes as well. So one of the things that can affect your images is just

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.740
turbulence in the atmosphere. So the same turbulence that you get when you're on a plane and,

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:48.140
you know, you pass through like a warm or a cold pocket of air and all of a sudden you feel it

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:53.620
shake. If light passes through that, it can get really distorted. And so they actually do some

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.540
real time adjustment of images on some telescopes. So you might've seen images of telescopes where

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:03.560
they're pointing like a giant laser out of the top of them. And that laser, you're essentially

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.800
recording what happens to the laser as it passes through the atmosphere. And the same, same way that

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:13.220
noise cancelling headphones work where they record the noise and then invert it. So you don't hear it.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:17.740
You record what's happening to laser, invert that and put it on the image that you're getting from

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:22.920
the telescope and you can get rid of the atmosphere sort of ruining your stuff.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:28.460
Yeah. I've always wondered how they were able to, you know, account for like the waves of heat

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.700
and all sorts of stuff in the atmosphere and still get these super clear pictures from ground-based

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.140
telescopes.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.320
That's how they do it. Lasers.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:41.960
Awesome. It's like it's in the future, but now. All right. So the next one that you talked about

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.760
was data analysis and processing large quantities of data. And that's actually what's on the screen

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:46.940
here.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.160
Yeah.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:53.140
Live share as well, right? You have this really cool example of brightness of 600,000 galaxies.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:53.720
Yeah.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.200
Something like that.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:59.020
So one of the biggest surveys that's ever been taken. So, you know, you can do stuff like I do

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.580
where you sort of spot observe galaxies you're interested in, but then there are some telescopes

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:08.700
that's just sole job is to survey the entire sky or the entire like northern sky or entire southern

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.000
sky. And then you end up with like, here's all the things that's been observed, you know,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.040
and you have to write algorithms to pick all those out. That's another side of obviously astronomy as

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.020
well as like picking out the areas of interest from this huge survey. And you can end up with data

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.360
tables that are like, here's 600,000 galaxies that have been found with the brightness. So

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.900
that thing you're showing there. So you've got an ID in the first column and they're like 18 digits

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.320
because it's all sorts of like, you know, coordinates in there and everything.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:34.540
Yeah.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:41.640
But then U, G, R, I, and Z is five measures of brightness in different what we call wave bands.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:48.060
So U is sort of like the bluest light and then Z is the reddest light. And so you can,

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.940
if you look in sort of different colors of light, you can see different things. So blue,

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:57.960
is lots of new stars, red is lots of old stars. And so that's what you have for like 600,000 galaxies.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.520
That's amazing.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.220
But then you also have all the other things that you might have measured as well, like their size

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:10.560
and their shape and various other different things. You can end up with tables that are

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.600
just huge essentially. And you'll see that the eagle eyed people might see that the format for the

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:22.200
table is .fits, F-I-T-S. And that's a format that was invented by astronomy as well, because it's a format

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.420
that can both take a table like that, but it can also store an image at the same time. But you can store

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:31.500
both a table and an image or many images, you know, so there's all sorts of different things you can do

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:37.100
with it. So it's very, very useful. I think it's called a flexible image table system, but don't quote me on that.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:43.620
Yeah, we have full of acronyms in astronomy. So yeah, things like that, where you want to be able

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:49.660
to load in the data table, manipulate that data, you know, say, okay, transform this column into

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:55.560
something else that I'm interested in, whatever it might be for 600,000 columns, you know, but you

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.960
don't want to do that on an iterative loop again, like NumPy is great for that. It's just, it's a

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.000
perfect tool for it.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.340
Yeah. And, you know, maybe if you didn't have Python as a skill, you might try to do this in

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.160
Excel, or maybe even slower would be Google Sheets or something like that.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:09.740
Yeah.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:15.020
But I think those have a limit around 101, you know, 1.05 million rows, and then also

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:19.220
your mental well being in terms of how long you gotta wait for stuff to happen, right?

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.420
Yeah, exactly.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:25.200
Yeah. One thing you do point out in the video when you're talking about this is the mistakes

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:31.540
that people have made, especially around the NHS there where-

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.340
The test and trace.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:36.840
Yeah, the test and trace stuff where they tried to do this with Excel and, you know, missed

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.740
a ton of COVID cases in the early days.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.800
Yeah, exactly. Just because, you know, when you have that many rows, it's so difficult to

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.680
keep track of in a spreadsheet. You know, with this, you can index it really easily. You can

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:53.280
say, give me all the rows that have fulfilled this value or quantity or whatever. And it's just

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.600
much easier to stay on top of and manipulate. You know, in astronomy, there's lots of people

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.700
who use, you know, pandas data frames as well to do this kind of stuff. So, you know, it's

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.000
using all the tools that are available.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.380
This portion of Talk Python in Me is brought to you by Cloud ENV. You've heard that you should

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:16.020
never commit things like API keys and database connections to source control. Then how do you

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:20.940
manage them? Do you email them around? Ask on Slack, hey, what's the new password for our

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:26.620
Postgres server? Please don't. What if I told you there was an end-to-end encrypted cloud sync

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:32.360
system for environment variables in Python? That setup literally takes just a few seconds. There's

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.640
no learning curve and you just pip install the sync library. And maybe you could even access

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:43.640
control your secrets by adding IP allow or deny lists or even getting notified when a new IP address

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:48.640
tries to access one of your secrets like your database connection string. Yeah, that'd be cool if

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.280
somebody built that, right? Well, they did. And it's called Cloud ENV. You set up your environment

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.560
on your server with a simple CLI, and then you access your secrets from your Python app using their

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:04.260
incredibly simple package. Simple as in two lines of Python. Seriously, it's just load Cloud ENV,

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:09.920
OS.getEnvironment, and you give it something like database connection string. You just use OS.getEnvironment,

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:25.600
and it's preloaded all these synchronized and access control secrets. Keep your secrets, well, secret and in sync with Cloud ENV. Get started at talkpython.fm/cloud ENV. That's talkpython.fm/cloud ENV.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:37.300
A couple of listener comments. One is, how long would it take roughly for the code to parse and analyze the data? And what would you do with that? I think that leads well into the next one.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:43.620
Yeah. I mean, loading data tables, even in 600,000 size is so quick in Python. Like by blink and it's done it.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.740
Yeah, exactly. I touched on that. Like you would wait in Excel for a while.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.540
Yeah. I would wait to just open the spreadsheet, whereas this is just like, yes, I'm done.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.140
Yeah. It's almost instant, right? Probably.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:33:14.620
Yeah. And then again, like, I mean, it depends what you're doing, right? If you're, you know, just transforming one value into another. So for example, people who have a major physics, like flux into luminosity. So for example, flux is what you observe because you're very distant away from something, but luminosity is like the absolute value it would have if you were like right next to it. That's how bright it would be.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:36.520
For example, that's just a simple translation, right? So that on 600,000 rows would probably be quite quick. But if you're doing something a little bit more complex where you're taking each value and perhaps using it in inference or something like that, like optimizing a model based on all these values or something that would obviously take a lot longer. You know, I've had code run from anywhere from a second to a week.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:36.980
Right.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:45.000
So yeah, it just depends what you're doing. And then I think it might, yeah, like you said, lead into the next one is what would I do with the data afterwards? I'd make a plot with my plot lib.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:56.240
And that leads into, yeah, the next thing that you covered, which was model fitting and that sort of thing, right? So Freya asks, how do you search the galaxies and find the ones you need for your research?

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:05.240
Yeah. I mean, so for example, I'm really interested in a certain shape of galaxies. So I call them the egg white omelets of the galaxy world.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.320
Not the spiral galaxies.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:30.240
No. So if you think about a spiral galaxy, it's a nice flat disk and it has, you know, the spiral arms on the outside, but in the middle, there's usually what we call a bulge, but you can think of like an egg yolk, right? It's like a fried egg, a galaxy. And it has this bulge of stars that instead of, you know, on a nice flat disk where all the stars are orbiting, like in the solar system, like planets in the solar system, you've got stars that look a bit more like a beehive.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:43.000
And then you've got stars that look a bit more like a beehive because they're sort of all doing this, you know, in various different planes around the very, very center. And we think those form when two galaxies merge together and you just, you ruin all the nice rotation and you end up with this big blob in the middle.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:55.780
I'm interested in the things that don't have that blob. So we think they don't, they haven't had a merger, right? And I think, okay, well, what's happened to the black hole in the middle if you haven't merged two things together and shoved a load of stuff into the center?

00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:10.800
So that's what I'm interested in. So I need two things to do that. First of all, I need to know what shapes the galaxies are. And that kind of stuff comes from literally, well, two ways. First way that we've been doing it for a long time is people eyeballing the images and looking at them and labeling.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:30.860
They have spiral structure. It has a bulge. It doesn't have a bulge. It looks like it's merging, all that kind of stuff. And that's been done individually by people, you know, from Edwin Hubble back in the 1920s to the, you know, poor PhD students that are given 50,000 of them to look at as part of their PhD and label them.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:50.040
But then more recently in the past 10 years, a project called Galaxy Zoo, which is a, what we call a citizen science project online. So galaxyzoo.org still running, you know, gets the public to classify the shapes because it's a fairly simple task for even, you know, like a five-year-old to do is to show them an image and say, is this round and blobby or is this a spiral shape?

00:35:50.040 --> 00:36:00.300
And that 600,000 images of galaxies that would take one astronomer, you know, years would have terrible statistics. There'd be mistakes all over the place because they hadn't had their morning coffee or something yet before they started.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:09.040
You know, we can get instead 40 people to look at each image and it's fantastic statistics and all that as well. And that's still going because we're still taking pictures of the sky.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:16.020
But there were people out there thinking, well, what about machine learning? Can you train a machine to do this with an algorithm? And yes, you can.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:28.460
So Galaxy Zoo actually held a Kaggle competition for this as well about five or six years ago and found that you can get sort of like 90% sort of like agreement with an expert human.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:36.640
And we're getting to the point now where Galaxy Zoo is running on the website, but we've got a machine in the background, which is deciding what to show to people.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:43.280
The machine's like, I've classified all the simple, easy things, but I'm not sure about these ones. So can you look at this?

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:53.820
So it's sort of like a joint effort. And that's going to be really important with the next generation of big survey telescopes we're building. People might have heard of the LSST or it's been recently dubbed the Vera Rubin Observatory.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.040
And there's so much data coming out of that thing that is ridiculous now.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.440
All right.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.100
They're estimating instead of like a, you know, 600,000 to a million, they're estimating like a billion galaxies.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:02.660
Wow.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:18.480
So that's not scalable to get a person or a couple of astronomers to do that. So that's where we need machine, you know, crowd to do it. And yeah, so once you've got those classification labels, either from machine or cloud, then it's just the column in your data table, right?

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:28.340
And then you can filter based on, you know, give me all the things with the lowest, you know, vote for having this bulge in the center. And I'll look at those and sort of whittle it down kind of thing.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.040
So yeah, it's really how you choose them is just from a data table.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:39.840
Yeah. Once you get the number, then it's super easy, right? It's coming up with it. I did have recently, I had David Armstrong and you have Gamper. They're out of the UK as well.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:50.740
At least David is how they used machine learning to discover 50 exoplanets in some of the Kepler data as well. So yeah, it's super interesting how ML starting to make its way into astronomy.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:04.180
Yeah. And that's another area where ML and citizen science are working together. So there's a, like Galaxy Zoo, there's a project called Planet Hunters, which is using the follow-up to the Kepler space telescope, which is the one that discovered like 5,000 exoplanets.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:20.980
There's now a follow-up called TESS, which is doing the same. And so they're like, we have run our algorithms in the ML on all the data. It's found what we've told it to look for, but then here's all the data. Do you see anything else? Do you see planets? Do you see anything weird? Do you see things unexplained?

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.160
And that's the thing that you really need people to eyeball.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.740
Right, right. The ML is going to find what it knows to find.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:27.900
Yes, exactly.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.080
That looks weird, but not, you know.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.180
Not what you told me to look for.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.140
Yeah, exactly.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.520
You know, you can't train a machine to look for stuff that's just interesting because everything will be interesting to it.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:44.680
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's the problem with software. You know, you give it input, it gives you a number out the other side and it's easy to trust that number, but that's not always the way to go.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:44.940
Yeah.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:53.260
All right, so the next one you talked about was data visualization and you had some really interesting examples of galaxies colliding that I touched on.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:39:00.800
And then also your research is around black holes. And so there's a visualization you show of star coming too close to a black hole.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.260
Yes.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.440
Getting spaghettified.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:12.280
Yeah, it's one of my favorite words ever. Spaghettification is what happens when you get too close to very strong gravity, like around a black hole, where the gravity is stronger at your feet than at your head.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.440
So you get stretched out like spaghetti.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.040
Never look at spaghetti the same way afterwards.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:27.400
But yeah, so data visualization can be anything from, you know, plotting two columns in a data table against each other in a nice scatter plot and being like, oh, look, there's a correlation there.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.000
And then you can fit a line to it with, you know, an optimization, like thinking scipy or something.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.480
And that's one side of it of sort of data visualization.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:42.100
Then there's the sort of like, you know, 3D data visualization you can do with like plotly again of like, you know, three columns in a data table.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:50.800
But then there's things you can do like this, where you have simulated what's actually happening around a black hole.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.440
And you said, okay, my black hole is here.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.120
And I have a star over here that's going to get too close.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:01.600
If I code up all the laws of gravity and Einstein's theory of general relativity and set it running, what happens?

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.560
And then visualizing what you actually see.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:17.700
And obviously the code behind this is literally like an array telling you where more of the particles that used to be in the star now are on this grid that you've made, where one point on the grid will be a black hole.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.720
And every sort of time stamp that you run it at.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.920
So maybe you do it for every, say a year or something, I guess, on these timescales.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.840
We're talking astrophysics, right?

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.040
So we're not going to do them every second.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.660
So short.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.340
I know.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:36.420
So like a year between frames, you recalculate where they all are now based on the laws of physics.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:43.000
And then you obviously want to visualize those arrays as something that, you know, we can actually picture what's going on.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.460
And you can play them as a beautiful movie like this as well.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.480
And it looks amazing.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.860
But you get obviously so much understanding from that as well.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:54.280
It's fun to, you know, you don't, because I don't run a lot of simulations day to day.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:41:01.220
So it was fun then just to break down what that actually looks like behind the scenes in terms of, yeah, that is just a bunch of numpy arrays basically.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:01.860
Yeah.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.500
How interesting.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.540
The star is just a bunch of points in a glob in the beginning.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.560
Yeah, exactly.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:07.960
Yeah.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.760
And that's all to do with like n body simulations they're called.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.880
So n being the number of particles you simulate.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:18.640
And obviously the number that you decide to simulate, it goes up as I think is n squared in terms of computing power and stuff.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.240
So yeah, it's, it's very difficult.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:28.160
I mean, this is why, you know, I'm like running what we call cosmological simulations where you simulate the entire universe.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.020
It's obviously very difficult.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.300
They take years to run.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.440
You need a lot of RAM for that.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.260
Yeah.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.700
And then obviously this is what I was talking about before where you have a nice 3D visualization.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:41.980
So this is of something called the Radcliffe wave, which was discovered this time last year.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:46.060
And it was something that was nearby to where the sun is in the Milky Way.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:54.440
So this is sort of like gas card positions, but until they plotted them in, in a 3D way so that you could like drag around the data and overlay.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:54.860
Okay.

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.760
These are known positions of other things.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:03.800
And these are the shapes of say the spiral arms nearby that, you know, it was then that you could actually see spatially what was going on.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.400
They realized that this was actually a feature in the Milky Way.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.860
And so that, you know, I can drag it around and everything on plotly.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.780
So it's great to see.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.000
And there's data visualizations.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.620
And so this is just plotly, right?

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:14.460
Yeah, exactly.

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:20.100
And it's tools like this, though, that like you say, oh, that seems obvious to plot something in 3D to see the spatial scale.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.720
But if the tool didn't exist, tool didn't exist, you know?

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:32.480
As say somebody who's a scientist or just looking to visualize data, they just need to get it into basically like a numpy array of data, throw it at plotly, give it some colors.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.760
And it does all the visualization and the rotation and the zooming and that stuff, right?

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.460
So it's more accessible than maybe it seems.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:38.840
Yeah.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.680
And that's the thing is that it is very accessible.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.720
But what I love is that, you know, astronomy is driving forward a lot of these tools as well, because you're saying we need this.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.840
You know, people often say, like, why do we bother studying astronomy?

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.020
Like, you know, shouldn't we put money into other things?

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:54.580
But I think one of the sort of indirect benefits is how much astronomy drives forward technology.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:59.340
You know, digital camera detectors are invented because astronomers needed a better way to record stuff.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:05.840
And Wi-Fi was massively improved because astronomers came up with a better way to recombine signals that have been scattered.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.080
They go around your house and stuff.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.400
And another thing is tools like this.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.000
And especially when we look towards a lot of the VR stuff that's coming out soon as well.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.540
So I'm thinking about, like, you know, when you can put on a VR headset and you can be immersed in an image or anything like we have now.

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.560
We like to call them 3D images.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:28.440
So we'll take an image of something at every single wavelength or wavelength steps, right?

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.060
So from infrared to uv or from red colors to blue colors.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.400
And like I said before, there's lots of different features that pop out of those things.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:40.860
So you can imagine actually being able to be immersed in that to actually see it for yourself rather than maybe doing it in something like plotly.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:47.720
Or you could also imagine there's a star called Ita Carina that we think is very close to supernova and collapse.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:52.540
And people have observed it for years and seen the big 3D structure of it and modeled the 3D structure.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.120
People have 3D printed it.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:59.620
But you can imagine being put in a VR environment and being able to fully, you know, move stuff around and get into anything.

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:00.700
Just walk around it.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.640
Exactly.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.480
Yeah.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:09.140
And sort of that kind of a tech is the kind of thing that I can really see a lot of science pushing forward.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:15.000
Like it having a use case, which at first it necessarily didn't in society, but science gave it a use case.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.200
And then all of a sudden it became, it was developed.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.080
And then all of a sudden society realized another use case for it.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.100
And it snorched no balls from there really.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:22.860
So cool.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.480
Yeah.

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:23.760
Yeah.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.220
Super neat.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:24.640
Super neat.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.580
So that video covered the five things.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:31.960
And then you interviewed your friend, your colleague who also actually did more simulation work than analyzing and whatnot.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.780
So yeah, I recommend people check out that video.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.020
Of course, it'll be in the show notes.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:38.780
Are you ready for some quick career advice before we move on?

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:39.120
All right.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:44.820
So out here in the comments, would you recommend a computer science for A-level so it'll be easier to use code in university?

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.000
What subjects would be best for astrophysics?

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.360
Yeah.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.360
Computer science definitely won't hinder you in terms of science.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.640
Like I think it's great to sort of know about the ins and outs of computing.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:59.700
And you will do a lot of coding as part of a computer science A-level or whatever is the equivalent in your country.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.460
So that's sort of like the 17 to 18 year old that we do in the UK, the exams.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:06.460
Other subjects, obviously physics, obviously maths.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:12.740
For sort of context, so we only do four subjects, maybe only three for our A-levels.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.100
We specialize very early in the UK.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:18.120
But I did physics, maths, chemistry, further maths, which is like extra maths.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.080
And like that was just because they were my favorite subjects.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:27.300
And I knew that they were the ones that if I had a pile of homework, I'd be picking those off the top, you know, rather than my English homework or whatever.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.900
There'd be some essay buried underneath that's going to get written.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:30.360
Exactly.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.600
I mean, like I'll do that later.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.940
And like future me would hate me because I'd put it off for too long.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.760
I'd be doing it the next day right before the class.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.940
And so that's why I did those.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:42.920
And that was great because I got to university and the further maths helped because there was some I'd already seen.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:50.760
But like I think when you're at school, it's often quite pressurized to feel like you have to know everything to either get into university or before university.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:55.160
But that's kind of the point of college or university is they're there to teach you these things.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.800
They don't expect you to know everything.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:02.940
So just give yourself the best platform to get into whatever subject you care about the most.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:08.580
So if you're considering a certain subject at a certain university, just check what their entry requirements are.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:12.460
If they're like, oh, actually, we would need you to do computer science, then great.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.280
Take computer science.

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.780
But otherwise, you know, just take those subjects that you like the most is what I would say.

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:18.580
Yeah, fantastic.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.620
And then also another interesting question from Giordia.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:26.300
You know, we have been talking as we're just taking Jupyter for advantage.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.500
Like Jupyter is here.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:28.180
So we just use that.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:32.900
But the question is, was the Jupyter ecosystem a game changer for astronomy and training in your opinion?

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:33.700
And in what way?

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:34.980
I think it was for science.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:35.380
Oh, yeah.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.120
I mean, it didn't exist when I was learning.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:41.560
And I think I would have picked it up a lot quicker if it had existed.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:46.940
I think because it's just a more familiar interface than being faced with a terminal or, you know, a blank.

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.160
I used idle way back in the day, right?

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.740
Like a blank idle, like empty.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:52.720
What's the word?

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.340
File.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:53.860
Thank you.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:54.380
Brain.

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.560
I finally came out.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.420
After a long day of work.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.920
Yeah, I think it would have been a lot easier.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:03.040
And I do a lot of my tutorials and stuff like that that we share around colleagues.

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.500
And I also like right now I've got we read a paper the other day.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.920
We were like, this is really cool.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.060
We could test that.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.180
It would be a really quick plot if we just made it.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.620
So I've done that in Jupyter notebooks.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.660
I've been like, and I've been like, you know, marked down being like, we read this paper.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.480
Here's the link of the paper.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.760
Like we had this idea.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.620
So let's test it.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:19.280
Here's the data.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.260
Here's the plot we make.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.280
And here's what I think it means.

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.500
And I'm going to share it to my colleagues.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:28.580
And they'll read it through so much more easily than if I'd sent, you know, an email with an embedded PDF or something.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:28.840
Right.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.180
So.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:29.420
Right.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.300
A lot of times you send the picture, but obviously you don't necessarily send the code.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.380
And people are like, well, what is this?

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.560
And what does this mean?

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.600
Like, are you sending the same thing I'm sending?

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.120
All right.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.020
Like, yeah, it really is combined those in interesting ways, I think.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:40.520
Yeah.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:52.420
And I think it really was a game changer, especially for astronomy, just because astronomy is such a visual science that seeing both the code and the images next to each other and what each step physically did to the image.

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.600
You know, like I was talking about before, like removing all the sources of noise and all that stuff.

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.440
That is so helpful in Jupyter.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.020
Yeah.

00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:58.640
Fantastic.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.100
All right.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.460
Well, we're getting a little bit near the end of our time together.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:05.820
So I want to wrap it up with one thing that I think is also worth giving a shout out to.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:11.420
And then you did a nice video of an astrophysicist reacts to funny space meme.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:11.720
Yeah.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.640
We'll close it out with that.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.900
But you also wrote a cool book that came out pretty recently, right?

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.880
Called Space, 10 Things You Should Know.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.840
You want to tell people about that?

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.320
Yeah, sure.

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.480
So it's Space, 10 Things You Should Know is the title in the UK.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.580
And Space at the Speed of Light is the title in North America and Canada.

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:28.720
Oh, okay.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.280
Space, 10 Things You Should Know everywhere else in the world.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.340
That's why I'm in the UK.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.500
I'm sorry, I pulled it up.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.040
Yeah, sure.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:46.060
So it's about, it's sort of like 10 short essays on the things that I feel like you should know if you're wanting to either dip your toe in astronomy or someone who's loved it for a long time but wants to make sure that they're like, you know, do I really know this stuff?

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:54.340
If you were going to a dinner party with a bunch of astronomers, like these are the, like you'd want this sort of like base knowledge to be like, oh, I get what they're talking about or whatever.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.320
How much differential equations do I need to know?

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.120
There are none.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:57.980
Absolutely none.

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:02.140
It's written, so it's written with my, like I'm talking to my mom basically.

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:05.140
So my mom is intelligent but not necessarily educated.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.220
So she didn't, she's finished school at 16.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:11.460
So she didn't have the privilege of an education like I did.

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.060
She just started work straight away.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.260
And so she's so curious about space and the universe.

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.400
Like I think a lot of people are.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:22.700
And so I wrote it with her in mind of being like, okay, what would my mom understand if I said to her, you know, and she loved the book.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.700
So I take that as a good thing.

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.320
So, oh, Freya, thank you.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.100
Yeah, Freya says my favorite book as well.

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:28.680
So absolutely.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.640
But yeah, so it's, it's, I really enjoyed writing it.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.520
It's nice and short.

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:41.880
So it's not too intimidating if, you know, you don't want to read a big long book about space, but there's everything from like, okay, like, why do we think dark matter exists, for example?

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.880
But like, could aliens exist?

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.340
And also like the things we still don't know as well, which I like.

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.860
So I like thinking about that.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:50.180
Yeah.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:50.440
Yeah.

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.580
There's, it seems like everything is known.

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:53.580
But no.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.020
There's so much, but no.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:55.620
No.

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.440
There's so much more that we don't know.

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:57.720
A lot more than it used to be.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.300
Yeah.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:58.700
Yeah.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:49:59.120
Exactly.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.120
Fantastic.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.000
All right.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.260
So I want to do not the same memes, but I want to kind of round this out just as a fun, like, let's do the memes.

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:10.620
So let me, I've hidden this on our screen share.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.220
So I couldn't see what you were planning.

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:13.960
You couldn't jump ahead.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:14.520
I'm excited.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.740
All right.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:21.800
So I'll pull up a couple of memes here and I'll try to describe these to the listeners because almost everyone's just listening.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:22.220
Sure.

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:23.000
But yeah.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.600
So setting the stage here, like on yours, this is kind of a sneaker educational video that you did, right?

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.100
Like you did the meme, but then you, you talked about the science that would actually.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:33.580
Yeah.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:39.340
People were commenting, like, I clicked for a meme review and now I've come away with more knowledge than any physics class I ever taught.

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:42.620
It's like a sneak attack.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:44.060
Exactly.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:44.660
Oh, all right.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:45.480
We go through these pretty quick.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.420
I'll try to describe them.

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:46.820
All right.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:57.180
So the first one we've got, remember Elon Musk shot at SpaceX, shot his Tesla Roadster and put a camera on his space and was flying along.

00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:02.020
But actually this is around the same time that Apple Maps came out and was really bad.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:07.340
So the meme is it's this, it's earth in the background with the Tesla flying through the air.

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:08.800
It says stupid Apple Maps.

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.660
I love that.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.180
I love it.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:14.600
Because it really, you know, I miss Google Earth.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.380
Can we bring, is Google Earth still a thing?

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:21.560
I feel like when that came out, we spent so long, like zooming out of the entire earth.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.080
And then all we do is just zoom into our house.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.640
All the way from the whole earth.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.700
I'm like, I wonder where that hiking trail ended.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.620
And I like went along it for so far.

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:31.880
Yeah.

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:40.260
But yeah, I feel like Apple Maps was just so like, I just wasn't intuitive with the zoom and you could end up just like, oh God, I can see the entirety of like Europe right now.

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.320
Exactly.

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.340
All right.

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:43.140
Next one.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.740
There's an otter carrying two little tubes.

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.980
Shooting along.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.480
He says he needs those parts for his spaceship.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.740
He's going to otter space.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:57.380
I kind of wish that I studied black holes in otter space now because I feel like they would be cuter for one.

00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.080
It's a very cute picture.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:00.880
Also infinitely cool.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:01.260
Yeah.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:01.640
All right.

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.200
Next one.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.460
You touched on this like this.

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:04.600
You talked about the Wi-Fi.

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:11.660
So there's, I have no idea why there's a seal here, but it says NASA receives data from over 17.3 billion kilometers away.

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.220
I lose the Wi-Fi signal in my own bathroom.

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:26.640
But that's the thing though, that the techniques that are developed to like recombine all the scattered signals from 17.3 billion kilometers away are the same ones that are used to recombine your Wi-Fi.

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:34.700
But apparently brick walls are better at disrupting them than the earth's atmosphere is.

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:34.960
Yeah.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.460
The magnetic field, 17 billion kilometers, all that.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:38.840
Awesome.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:39.100
Yeah.

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:39.580
All right.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:40.020
A couple more.

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:42.820
Also, NASA's detectors are much more sensitive than your phone detector.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:42.960
Yeah.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.320
That's true.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.180
Yeah.

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.600
You wouldn't want to carry that around.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.460
All right.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.360
So this one is a different kind of eclipses.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:51.660
So we've got the moon, the earth, and the sun.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:55.180
And it tries to show you what the difference between a lunar and a solar eclipse is.

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.280
So it has moon, earth, sun.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.080
It says lunar eclipse.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.160
It has earth, moon, sun, solar eclipse.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.700
And then it has earth, sun, moon, apocalypse.

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:04.860
Great.

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.560
It's so, so good.

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.580
I love it so much.

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.420
Yeah.

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:09.040
That's a good one.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:09.280
Yeah.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:09.840
All right.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.820
We never see the moon.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:11.360
That'd be so sad.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.780
All right.

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.160
So here's a picture of a traditional alien like E.T.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:19.560
And it says, here's a creature capable of intergalactic space travel, steals a cow.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:27.340
And the thing is, people justify this as like, well, the cow population is greater than the

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:28.200
human population.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:29.780
Therefore, they will have assumed.

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.680
I was like, if they go by that, they'll be abducted.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:33.940
They'll be abducted loads of chickens.

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:35.380
Exactly.

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:36.540
So crazy.

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.540
This one made me laugh really hard.

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:38.940
I like this.

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:39.340
All right.

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.260
I mean, I would love aliens, to be real.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:44.360
But I doubt that we'll ever make that kind of contact with them.

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:44.900
Exactly.

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:45.440
Exactly.

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:48.780
I do think they probably are out there, but they're far, far away.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:49.080
All right.

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.600
So this one is really close to your research.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.320
Yeah.

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.220
It's a black hole and then there's stuff around it, but you can see nothing in the

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:54.560
black hole.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.840
It says, what happens in the black hole stays in a black hole.

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:56.960
Yeah.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.760
Kind of like Las Vegas.

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:01.500
I mean, that is like the most physics accurate meme we've had so far.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.100
Yeah.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.020
Yeah.

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:04.800
I tried to find a few science-y ones.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.140
And then let's see what's the last one here.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:06.720
Oh, yeah.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.800
This one, it has the moon, which is just a picture of the moon.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:13.900
And then the dark side of the moon, he's dressed up like the emperor from Star Wars.

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:14.220
Palpatine.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:14.720
Yeah.

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:15.280
Palpatine.

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:15.540
Exactly.

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.000
So cute.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.760
I want like a little, like, do you remember they made, it has to made a load of like little

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.420
plushy teddy bear things of the planets and like all of their little satellites a while

00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:26.640
ago.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.500
I now want like the dark side of the moon as a little, as a little plushy toy.

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:35.580
But people get so confused with like the dark side of the moon and the far side of the moon

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:39.640
because the far side of the moon is the moon that we can't see because it's what's called

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:40.540
tidely locked.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.740
So only one side of the moon ever faces us.

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:47.520
So, but that's not the dark side of the moon because when we have a new moon, like

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:50.740
or a solar eclipse, the far side of the moon is lit up.

00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:51.160
Exactly.

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.800
Because we are seeing the wrong direction.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.140
Yeah.

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:53.480
Yeah.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.360
It is confusing, but still a good meme.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:56.720
All right.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:57.520
Those are fun.

00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:57.780
Thanks.

00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:58.780
They're great.

00:54:58.780 --> 00:54:59.100
All right.

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.020
So final two questions of the show.

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:04.780
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:05.680
VS Code.

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.200
I love VS Code.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:07.580
VS Code.

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.780
It only just pipped out Atom.

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.700
Like I was using Atom and then I saw you.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.060
It's good.

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.480
Command D in VS Code.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:20.320
Basically you can highlight a, like a parameter you've defined and then it picks out all of

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.960
the other times you've mentioned that parameter in your script.

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.720
And you'd be like, oh, I want to change the name.

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.900
And if you start typing, it will just change it everywhere.

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:31.900
And like the biggest joy I ever felt was discovering that was a thing.

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.200
Why is this named?

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:33.860
I don't want to change it.

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.140
Wait, it's so easy to change.

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.900
Yeah, exactly.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:37.360
It's great.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:37.600
Yeah.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.700
And I suspect you probably throw Jupyter in there as well as a lot of work, right?

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:42.760
But not proper editor, right?

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.060
I mean, those are kind of more exploration.

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:44.520
Yeah.

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.440
If I was doing something that I was going to share with colleagues, I'd do it on Jupyter.

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:52.980
So the final stage where I would visualize my data in a plot or I'd be able to like write

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.300
something out as an argument, I'd do it in Jupyter as well.

00:55:55.620 --> 00:56:02.800
But if I'm doing model fitting or if I'm doing a lot of heavy sort of image analysis, I will

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.060
do it in a script in like VS Code.

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:05.840
Yeah, for sure.

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.420
I think there are just different ways of working.

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:11.660
Are you trying to build something that you can reuse and kind of create a little library

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:12.100
out of?

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.440
Or are you trying to explore and you don't really know where you're going?

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:14.940
Exactly.

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:15.220
Yeah.

00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.600
I'd use Jupyter for doing that as well.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.640
Being like, okay, I have this data table.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.440
It's brand new.

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:20.560
Let's get to grips with it.

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:24.180
I'll do that in Jupyter again because it's just so visual to be able to grab stuff more easily

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:27.340
and be like, hmm, let's plot this against this and see if there's something there.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.320
Like I'll do that in Jupyter.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:32.680
Rather than like a, I used to do it in an IPython terminal, but it's just so much more

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:32.980
visual.

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:33.280
Yeah.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.260
I have a pop up, a sort of window or whatever.

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:35.640
Yeah.

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.240
Yeah.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:40.500
Well, that's another thing I love about VS Code is that when I then write up my papers,

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:47.400
so I use LaTeX, which is another programming language, VS Code can run the LaTeX script

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.080
for you.

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:48.580
Oh, nice.

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.560
It compiles it to the output.

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.420
So it can also do the same with Python as well.

00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:56.480
You can like highlight a little section and get it to run in a terminal as well with like

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.300
shift enter like you do in a Jupyter notebook.

00:56:59.300 --> 00:56:59.900
Oh yeah.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:00.280
Okay.

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.460
So it's just great.

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.180
It's just great.

00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.560
Fantastic.

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.260
All right.

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.100
And then final question.

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:08.520
There's almost 300,000 different packages out on PyPI.

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.040
And that's sort of the part of the beauty of Python, right?

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:16.180
Is just, you can go grab these things and bring them in, but you know, what one maybe you've

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.280
come across you want to recommend?

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:17.800
Yeah.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.020
So I was trying to think of something that would be applicable to like everyone and not

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.400
just, you know, someone in astronomy.

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:26.840
And my immediate thought, and I can't deny it's been one of the most useful packages just

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:34.240
ever to me is MC, E-M-C-E-E by Daniel Formamaki, who is an astronomer as well.

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:39.560
And it's a module that codes up Bayesian analysis, like Monte Carlo, Markov chain Monte Carlo.

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:40.820
So MC, MC.

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:41.140
Yeah.

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:41.460
Yeah.

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:45.840
And it's essentially like an optimization package, you know, like a sci-fi optimize or something

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.280
like that, but it uses Bayesian statistics to do it.

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:53.400
And the Markov chain Monte Carlo, which is really sophisticated way of optimizing, but also getting

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.700
sort of like, like, okay, you fitted this model.

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.080
This is your best fit, but this is how uncertain this model is as well.

00:57:59.080 --> 00:57:59.840
It's what it gives you.

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:03.220
And it's just so like ready and out of the box.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:04.740
It's so well documented.

00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.340
It runs great.

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.680
And it's just, I just can't fault it.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:09.660
Like, that's the thing.

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:11.580
And Dan is just like the coolest person.

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:15.400
He's just like, he taught me so much Python when I was a PhD student and he was sort of

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.020
like a senior PhD student as well.

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:19.760
And he has the, he has an accent very similar to yours, actually.

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.700
He's definitely from, I think he's from the Pacific Northwest, but I don't want to say that

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:23.240
in case I got it wrong.

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.800
And he's like, no, no, I'm from Southern California.

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.800
Exactly.

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.340
But like, he's an accent like yours.

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:33.780
And so I associate that sort of like really sort of like very sort of like slow, not

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:34.020
slow.

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:35.180
That sounds bad, but you know what I mean?

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:37.500
That, that sort of like cadence to an American accent.

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:38.460
Deliver it or whatever.

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:38.760
Yeah.

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.560
Yeah, exactly.

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.660
Like I associate that with just like, okay, I'm going to teach you this cool thing about

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:44.140
Python.

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:46.720
Like hold your hand through it.

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:50.120
So yeah, it's a great, great package.

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:53.900
If you're doing anything to do with like model fitting or Bayesian stats or anything like that,

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:55.200
I would like a hundred percent recommend.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:55.580
Awesome.

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:55.920
Yeah.

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:59.460
That's not something I've tried yet because I haven't had to use that, but it sounds really,

00:58:59.460 --> 00:58:59.960
really useful.

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:04.880
Just as a funny story, since you brought up accents, you know, so for like 10 years or so, I did

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.540
a professional development, like training.

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:11.880
I'd go to a company or somewhere and do like a week long in-person course.

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:17.440
And I did this one in Beijing and I think the students were nervous that I would come

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.500
maybe with like a broad Scottish accent or something.

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:21.880
It'd be very hard to understand.

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:27.180
And at the end of the course, everyone had to write a little review for the company I was

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:27.780
working for.

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:29.860
And like, what did you think of Michael as a teacher?

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:34.320
And then the company, they would go through and review if there's any weird comments.

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.300
Like, oh, what happened to this course?

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:35.880
Like, why did it go?

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:40.120
Like, tell us about why this weird, you know, people are unhappy or they're, you know, what

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.620
did you do to make them so happy or whatever?

00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:43.960
And the comment was just this.

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.620
Michael has a very good tongue.

00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:48.840
And they're like, you're going to need to explain this.

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.160
What is going on?

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.420
Was it mis-translation?

00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:52.380
Yeah.

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:53.960
I was like, he just has a good accent.

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.840
Like, he speaks clearly and like, whatever.

00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:56.280
Yeah.

00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.940
But it's just like the way on paper, the way that it ended up with, they contacted me like,

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:03.100
Michael, you need to tell me what's going on.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.760
I love that.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:10.260
My accent confuses people massively because I was like brought up in the Northwest of England,

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.600
but my mom's family are all from the Northeast of England.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.040
So it's this odd smush.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.780
And then most Americans haven't really heard a Northern accent or if they have, it's like

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.560
Sean Bean, you know?

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.440
It's like, let's take the hobbits to my city.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.080
That's all they've ever heard.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.360
That's another Lord of the Rings reference.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.300
God, they're flying today.

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.620
And so, yeah.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:33.340
And then I've spent obviously a lot of time in South of England now since I've moved and

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:38.680
my accents had to soften because academia and science in general is such a global thing.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.060
You know, so many people with so many different cultures and accents coming together that like,

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:47.620
if I talked in my normal one, I think a lot of people ask me to repeat things so many times

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:49.780
that it softens and it gets more.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:55.060
I enunciate things more now, which makes me sound posher, which I don't like.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:56.580
But nevermind.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.500
Yeah.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.340
How funny.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.180
All right.

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:01.760
So what a great conversation.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.600
Thanks for being here, Dr. Becky.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.440
It's, you know, like I said, you're doing great work.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.600
People should certainly check out your YouTube channel and what you're doing there.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.700
You're doing a lot of cool work to popularize science in a super accessible way.

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:13.680
So final call to action.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.120
People are interested in what you're doing.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.020
Maybe they want to get Python into their astronomy or maybe they want to get into astronomy.

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.000
What's your final call to action for listeners?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.020
Install AstroBuy.

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.920
I think it's a simple pip install AstroBuy to get into and check out all their documentation

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.740
as well.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:32.480
And, you know, do as much physics and maths as you can and get involved with Galaxy Zoo

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.780
and Planet Hunters online because all those kind of clicks end up in scientific research

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.120
papers and they thank the participants as well.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.100
So it's a great endeavor to be involved in.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:41.340
Yeah.

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:44.920
And one question on the way out, you know, someone was asking if they can read your,

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.260
can the public read your paper?

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:48.380
Does you have to be part of a journal subscription?

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:48.820
No.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.560
So all astronomy papers get posted on something called the archive.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.680
A-R-X-I-V.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.380
Oh, AstroPH on the archive.

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.980
And so they're all free to read.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.880
So you should be able to find them that way.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.860
They're all listed from my public website as well, actually.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.380
So you should be able to find them there.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:03.620
Yeah.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:04.140
Fantastic.

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:04.880
All right.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.380
Well, thank you so much for being here.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.140

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:08.960
Thanks for having me.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.380
Have had fun.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:09.620
Yeah.

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:13.720

I really appreciate it.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.080
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:34.960
Bye.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:34.960
Bye.
