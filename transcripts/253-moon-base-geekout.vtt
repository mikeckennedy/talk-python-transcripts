00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.120
This episode is a unique one. On this episode, I've invited Richard Campbell, developer and

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.960
podcaster who also dives deep into science and tech topics. We're going to dig into his Geek Out

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.740
series and spend some time talking realistically about moon bases and space travel. I think you're

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.020
really going to enjoy this conversation, but I would love to hear either way if you like this

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.900
minor diversion from the pure Python topics, although we do talk some Python and some programming.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.740
We can do more like these in the future if you all enjoyed listening to them as much as I enjoyed

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.260
making them. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 253, recorded February 14th, 2020.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:55.500

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.280
Richard, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.620
Nice to be here, Michael. Thanks so much for inviting me.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.880
It's really great to have you here. I'm super excited about our topic. There's a lot of things

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.600
that we cover on Talk Python to Me that is Python plus some other really cool topic. Python plus

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.940
large hadron collider. Python plus philosophy and machine image recognition. Stuff like that,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.100
right?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.060
You know, the LHG makes total sense to me because Python is such a great language for mashing huge

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.820
amounts of data. And the LHG spits out huge amounts of data. Like it is stunning.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.780
It's unbelievable.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.780
Yeah.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.340
Yeah.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.960
Yeah. It's really, there's like layers and layers, almost like the CPUs have like cache layers and

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.560
stuff. There's like that in like huge infrastructure at the LHG. It's amazing that place.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.360
Yeah. And it's interesting, funny truth about the geek outs. Not that I want to jump ahead here

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.960
is that the first show we made that could have been called a geek out, which at the time we did not

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:23.280
call it that was about a space antenna was a radio antenna where the big, the main problem was so much

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.900
data. And it was just the, I was interested in the data problem, but later came to appreciate,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.320
Hey, you know, that's kind of a geek out long before the geek outs were geek out.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.780
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So this idea of a geek out, this is something I have enjoyed

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.620
for years. And this is something that is very special that you have been doing. I don't even

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.660
know how much work this is. I know it's a tremendous amount of work and I'm super excited to get into it,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.240
but let's start at the beginning of this whole story here. Let's start with just how you got into

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.760
programming.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.280
I'm one of the original like generation zero microcomputer programmers, right? And

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.640
I was 10 years old in 1977 when I wandered into a radio shack buying parts for an electronic rocket

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.660
countdown timer.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.920
That's very appropriate for this topic.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.240
Well, I'm cause I'm that kind of lazy too. Like even saying five, four, three, two, one,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.800
too much work. I don't want to do that. So I was building a little, my father is an electrical

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.240
engineer. He taught me to solder from a very early age. So, you know, building gizmos was never a big

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.960
deal. So there I was in radio shack buying parts.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.340
Is this an Estes rocket? You could like push the button that would count down that you did or

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.560
you're correct. Yeah.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.200
Cause literally five, five, four, three, two, one.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.760
So, so you were in there and you saw this weird machine that you could talk to.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.120
Yeah. Well, later on, came to appreciate that the Tirasati model one, which is a very basic

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.260
microcomputer, only 4k RAM in it. They put one in every store. And so it was sort of sitting in the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.320
corner of the store, somewhat neglected. And I just started playing with it and it had me immediately,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.860
you know, for better or worse, I've just not done anything else. By the time I was 12,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.440
I was working in a Tirasati repair shop, a computer repair shop. So my basic first job

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.340
was repairing microcomputers. And that's so awesome. I've just, I haven't done anything.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.920
Like I don't know anything else really. I've worked every level of microcomputers you can think of

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.860
from repairing them and programming them and selling them and building networks. I was network certified

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.280
back in the two days. Like I've just worked on the whole thing. So there's no magic here. I've just

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.720
been in it longer than most people. Yeah. What were some of your first programming languages?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.000
well, of course the tiny basic that was on that Tirasati with its three error messages,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.600
what, how, and sorry. And, you know, learn Z80 assembler shortly after that, because you've only

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.780
got 4k of RAM. And so trying to get the most out of the machine was kind of a big deal. Right.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.780
And then as they, hardware evolved, like I couldn't even fold it for the Tirasati as a kid

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.120
that young. So, but the shop I was working for at H and S when I was 12, they had a lot of S100 bus

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.920
parts come through. And so I sort of scavenged my way through an S100 bus with an 8080.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:02.720
And, so that started out. So programming in 8080 and then some of the quick basics running on CPM.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.160
And then, you know, first real language of the one that made me money when I'm like 13 or 14 was the

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.380
original D base. Oh yeah. Right on. Uh-huh. So then now, you know, I, for better or worse, just sort of

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.380
followed my nose one language to the next. Where were the opportunities, right? And, and, making

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.160
some money and really in the eighties, I made more money restoring old hardware. So that was a, you know,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.140
that was during the, at the end, end of OPEC when inflation was crazy and so forth and lots of

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.180
companies were going bankrupt. And so I had written software for a bailiff service and they were

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.600
possessing computers and damaging them in the process, not knowing that they were doing.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.680
And so I would buy them at 10 cents on the dollar, repair them, and then sell them for 50 cents on the

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.740
dollar. Yeah. That's, that's a cool project as a young person. Yeah. So as a teenager, like I was

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.720
doing all right, making decent money on, on good equipment and, and setting up software and customizing

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.480
things. And, you know, one thing just leads to another. Yeah. Super cool. And what are you up to today?

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.580
You got a lot of irons in the fire from looking in from the outside.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.640
I like working on a lot of different things. Like I, I, that's my, my passion. Obviously I've been

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.980
doing, starting at rocks now for 15 years and I'm still the new guy, right? I'm the third co-host

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:23.180
run as radio. I started back in 2007. So every Wednesday since April, 2007, I make the dev

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.480
intersection conferences. So I've been involved in conferences since the nineties. This particular

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.300
imprint is particular brand we started in 2012 for a variety of reasons. And so those,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.560
all those things sort of hold together. They're kind of the same thing. They are, what do technology

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.260
people, developers, IT people, so forth need to know three to six months from now.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.140
Right. And whether, and it's just different ways of making things like that. And I advise a lot of

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.120
different companies. So I'm involved in the startup community and I've helped a bunch of businesses grow,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.780
uh, had a few of my own along the way and had some, you know, been acquired, been the acquirer,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.580
like they'd gone through all those different, permutations. My, the last sort of big wave of that

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.500
was 2013, 2014. And, and since then I've been, you know, just playing with a few companies I think are

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:18.040
cool and, advising some others, on directions and opportunities that are out there. It's an interesting

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.140
way to work. There's always new things. I can't do the same thing two days in a row, Michael. I'm not

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:28.440
that guy. Well, it sounds like you definitely have got it set up that way. And you know, it's, I don't

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.560
have that many irons, but I do have like that kind of mix and that fluidity. And I don't know about you,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.420
but I think I might be partially broken if I had to go back to a job with a commute.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.920
Oh yeah. No, look, I wouldn't hire me. I'm kind of, I'm very difficult to work with. I would not.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.400
Yeah, no, I'm not, I'm not employable anymore.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.500
Yeah. It's a great life. Yeah. Just so, your, your podcast, so .NET rocks,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.400
I actually was on there not long ago, but I've known you since before then. So thanks for having

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.480
me on there. Well, you have that amazing mix of having an experience in .NET and also, you know,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:06.760
embraced Python in a big way. I thought your tone about talking about Python was very relatable to

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.160
the average .NET developer. I really appreciate that show. Awesome. Yeah. Thank you. And then,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:17.720
run as radio, tell people more what that shows about. That's me exercising the IT side of my head

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:23.000
because I've, I've always lived in both worlds. Never been afraid of hardware. We care about

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.720
networking. You know, those are all the useful skills. And I just felt like, you know, back in

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.700
2007, the podcasts out there that spoke to the IT professional were pretty hostile to Microsoft.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.520
Now admittedly, you know, 2007 was not a great time for Microsoft. We did just come out of the

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.560
Vista debacle and you know, it was ugly, right? There was some dark times. Oh, it was a great time

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.100
to start an IT podcast with Microsoft technology while Vista is out, right? Like, woo, good, good one.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:55.660
But just having a coherent conversation about these are the stacks we're dealing with and you know,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.880
what works together and how you have some success. And I'm not saying I'm Microsoft only,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.620
I'm saying I'm just not Microsoft hostile. So, you know, a long time we talked about virtualization.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.340
Hyper-V was a joke. We talked about VMware because that was the real product. You know,

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:15.720
V sphere had that cloud architecture working long before, Hyper-V ever figured it out.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.140
Yeah. Although there's a whole interesting conversation about virtualization and what

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.340
it's done for like creating a cloud and whatnot. But yeah, absolutely.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:29.660
Let's move on to talking about this concept of the geek outs. Now for this show, we're going to talk

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.560
about space and the moon because you're passionate about it. I'm passionate about it. It's something

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.840
you've been doing recently. Sure. But maybe this idea you said earlier, there was this antenna and you

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.360
were studying how much data was coming off of it. You know, like all this data problem is pretty

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:50.580
interesting, but actually like actually the science is as well. And so I've listened to many of your

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:57.900
geek outs, for example, the one on supersonic air travel is super interesting. So maybe give us like

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:04.300
a quick overview or high level overview rather of these geek outs and what you've been up to and just,

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:09.020
you know, how do you research these things as people will see it's very deeply researched.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:14.180
Well, and it's research I do anyway, right? Like I'm someone who, who thinks a perfect Sunday morning

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:20.500
is reading several scientific papers and just to learn, to know what's going on. And I take notes.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.700
And I always have, right? It's a sort of a normal thing for me to do to sort of organize my thoughts. I

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.320
live in one note for that side of stuff. The geek outs are really, was ultimately Carl's idea. It goes

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:38.240
back to 2011. Carl being your co-host. On .NET Rocks. Yeah. And so back in 2011, when the last shuttle

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.580
landed, when Atlantis landed, we were on the phone together and not recording. And I ranted about

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.300
everything wrong with the shuttle and just how frustrating it was that he, you know, this was

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:53.300
the sort of ignoble end of this machine. And after I wound down, it must've been 20 minutes or so. And

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.940
he said like, are you done? And he said, you know, we should have recorded that. I think people want to

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.720
know that. I'm like, whatever. Like, I don't think anything of that. He says, no, no, we should do a

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.820
show on it. I really disagreed with him. I thought, you know, we're a developer show. This is not

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.800
relevant. We're going to be told to keep to our knitting. Anyway, I was wrong.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.900
We recorded the show and the main reaction was people asking questions, basically asking for more.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:20.280
And so it took a while to sort of come up with a format. Like we played with that. But at the time

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.680
at .NET Rocks, we were making three shows a week. So the idea of taking one of those shows per month,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:31.660
you know, we're doing 12 to 15 shows in a week, in a month, one of those in sort of going off the

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:37.080
reservation. Let's go talk about whatever people are interested in. So I put up surveys and, you know,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.880
took solicitations or ideas from the audience and they sort of sorted into this some, a lot of

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.460
alternative energy questions. What about solar? What about wind? What about nuclear? Lots of aerospace

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.900
stuff, more space, space, space, space, and other, then there's sort of another, so the other topics

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:59.040
that came along. And we'd put out one a month. And most for me, it was finishing research. So,

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.380
you know, you're taking notes all the time, but they never organized them to actually go back and say,

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:08.280
is there something here? Is there a narrative? How do we tell the story of this particular

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:14.740
technology? That is a different exercise. And so the pressure of, hey, on Saturday, I have to talk

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:21.040
for an hour with Carl, Carl being the everyman in a geek out, right? Asking the questions that everybody

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.420
would ask. How do I get that organized properly? And different topics came out different ways. You know,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:33.300
I didn't set out to make three shows on nuclear fusion, but as I organized the notes, I saw there

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:39.900
were three distinct areas. There was the government led, you know, high budget, the national ignition

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:45.680
group, and I turn jet. And then there was another group, which was all the tech billionaires. Like,

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.340
you can't be a cool tech billionaire if you don't have a fusion project.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.000
You need a rocket company and you need some kind of fusion project.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.080
You know, I do own the domain name tech billionaire or supervillain.com. I've been meaning to build this

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:03.080
site where he's like, who's closest to being Dr. No? And it's like, yeah, do you have an island?

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:10.100
Does your island have a volcano? Do you have a fusion power plant that, you know, doesn't work?

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:15.020
And you just go, can you fly yourself into space? Like eventually you get a long enough list where you're

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.140
like, I think you're Dr. No. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Just another project. I've never,

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.940
I've not gotten to, right. It's another thing to do, but it was interesting. The third one actually

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:30.200
ended up being cold fusion, not only explaining what happened, but also where some of the real

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.080
science exists in that space, which that was a surprise for me when I found what catalyzed that

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:41.760
was finding the Mitsubishi papers where they showed there is a catalytic reaction with palladium in heavy

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:47.900
water that involves transmutation of elements with, by fusing different protons. And that's,

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:54.980
that's miraculous. It doesn't make electricity, but it is a remarkable thing, right? It's an article

00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:03.040
science and it's buried under all of this crazy conspiracy theory around, you know, world government

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.680
suppressing energy generation. Like that's a thing.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.380
Yeah, absolutely. That is a little wacky.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:13.380
Yeah. It's just, you know, I understand conspiracy theories for this, you know, because people want

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.160
to believe that someone's actually in charge. That's the great thing about a conspiracy theory.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.520
Even if you're not party to the plan, at least there is a plan because the reality that there

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.220
is no plan is terrifying.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:30.160
Yeah, it absolutely is. And it's probably mostly the case. A lot of bouncing off of walls and

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.280
just to write their dude. People are just trying to find their way. I would say, you know, they,

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.920
obviously all the aerospace stuff is fun. All the energy stuff is fun in the others category. I would

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:44.140
bring up, I mean, barbecue and whiskey is us just getting drunk and talking, but they're good shows.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:49.700
I'm very happy. I'm pleased with how they came out. The genetically modified food series is an

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:55.200
interesting series for no other reason. It was hugely demanded and it's extremely controversial.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.860
I got the remarkable amount of nasty email about them and Monsanto called me, which is an interesting

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.960
day all by itself. And so, Oh my gosh, really? You've gotten some interesting calls. I have gotten

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:14.080
some interesting calls. And so the third GMO show is actually a radio lab style edit of my multi-hour

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:21.260
interview with a couple of scientists from Monsanto. And it's the only show of the thousands of podcasts

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:28.600
I've made over 15 or so years that my wife routinely refers to. Well, when people want to, you know,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.680
bring up some of the crazy conspiracy around GMO, she says, have you ever listened to this? And

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.800
hands that particular show out. And the other one that I mentioned in the other category is the

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:45.040
antibiotic show for no other reason than it was, I would argue it was the hardest work I've done

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:51.140
directly to make a show where I had read a couple of interesting papers, especially in the tech

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:56.160
so back in his area about new generation antibiotics, because this is big concern that antibiotics are

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:02.420
failing and we are finding new ones, but it's hard. But to actually fill out my knowledge enough to be

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:09.020
able to tell you why texobactins was so important, I crammed medical student journey, training

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:14.580
material into my head to be able to speak comprehensively about antibiotics, which was hard work and

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:21.400
disturbingly enjoyable. Right. Like to really, when's the last time you really sat down, like crammed for

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.860
an exam? Although in this case, the exam was a one hour conversation about antibiotics.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:31.180
Yeah. It was like an oral exam and the judge, the graders were your listeners.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.200
And then funny thing, of course, there's a bunch of folks that are actually in biology fields that

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.480
were listeners to the show. It's like, finally, you're doing a topic I know something about so I

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.220
can figure out if you're just making this stuff up. And I'm like, awesome. How'd I do? It's like,

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:48.420
nailed it. And that really pisses me off. Like, okay. It's like, I try very hard. I'm not saying I get

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:54.520
everything right. I try hard. Well, I think that that's really sums up all these shows. They're not

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.700
just interesting diversions from the developer side of things that you work on, but they're,

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:05.860
they're legitimate science. And you've brought up a lot of really interesting things. I feel like

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.460
they're, they're massively well-researched. So I love them. How many have you done?

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.580
There's about 80 of them now.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.080
80. Yeah. So I'll link to them all in the show notes and we'll talk about that.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:20.600
Yeah. Geekout.show is the shortcut link to the, just those. And right. Geekout.show. Perfect.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.460
Yeah. Cool.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:28.240
And it's easy way to go for no other reason than there's like 1700 .NET rocks. So trying to skim

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.840
the 80 out that are considered Geekouts, like good luck.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.520
Yeah. It's definitely not, not super easy.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:33.880
Yeah.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:39.340

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:51.360
All right. Well, let's take it and focus in on one of these topics that you spent some time working on. And that's around the idea of a moon base. So I don't know about you, but the moon has just fascinated me. I just moon in the stars. And it's, I don't know if it's science fiction, if it's just growing up in a place where you could see the night sky very clearly and shooting stars. And you could just look out there and just go, wow.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.360
But we're also a generation.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.600
Look at what is out at night. You know, it's, I just love.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:07.660
Although we don't see near as much now with the amount of light pollution up there, but we're also children of Star Trek and heaven help us space 1999, which by the way, don't ever go back and watch that show.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:18.380
Your childhood memories of those shows are awesome and they're way better than the reality. That show is terrible. I found a torrent of it. Don't do it.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:34.120
Yeah. I tried to show the old James Bond shows to my daughters when they were like 13, 14. Like, oh, we're going to start at the beginning. It's going to be so amazing. We'll watch all of them. And they're like, these effects are so bad. We can't watch this show. And it's just like, it's just, you know, some of those things have to be experienced in the moment. You shouldn't go back to them.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:39.300
Well, and here we are in the post me too world. Don't watch Roger Moore. You'll be shocked.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.560
I know.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.080
It's just like, that is not acceptable.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.960
No, no, it is definitely, definitely not. You got to take it in context, I guess.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.920
But again, it's childhood memories are awesome. Don't ruin them. Right.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.280
Perfect.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.240
Yeah. Don't go back.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:20:07.040
For sure. So, you know, for me, it's probably a mix of science fiction. And then just, I spent a decent amount of time looking up at the sky at night, warm summer evenings. What got you interested in this, in space? And then in particular, this idea of the moon base.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:33.360
I mean, again, grew up in the generation where we just missed Apollo. You know, I was, what, five years old when the last moon landing happened. So, you know, we don't know that. We were too little. We saw the space shuttle go up and go around the earth over and over to boldly go where many people have gone before. It was the moon base particularly. I mean, this is just my geek out chain, right? So you're working through subjects.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:59.820
But it was a European Space Agency paper in like 2016 that I read where they were speaking very coherently about a research base on the South Pole of the moon. So not, you know, pie in the sky. We've got to expand humanity, surprise, and so forth. But the same way, it was very much the same style paper as deciding on putting another base in Antarctica, which they still do.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:29.800
Right.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:41.420
It started to make sense. And that was interesting to me, is it no longer was, as Apollo was, is sort of, this is what we do to establish our dominance in society, like the space race was in the 60s.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:50.740
Right. The whole space race in the 60s was, we're going to spend 20 times what we've been spending on space because it's a technological race, right?

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:50.760
Yeah.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.460
This doesn't make as much sense anymore.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:22:00.460
At the height of the Apollo program, 5% of the U.S. budget was being spent on space.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:08.860
It's a tremendously huge number compared to what's being spent right now, which is slightly less than 0.5%.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:09.040
Yeah.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:27.500
So a 5% expenditure is Manhattan Project money. It is literally moonshot money. And so, of course, it's going to end because you're going to achieve the goal. And the goal was to beat the Soviets at something in space because America was coming from behind, right?

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:58.280
Right.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.600
All four failed. And then they stopped.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.680
Right.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:19.760
And the Americans established it. But, you know, there was a strong case once in Apollo 8 went around the moon. That was a strong case to stop there. At that point, they'd beaten the Soviets. And the risk was so high. There were so many failure modes in landing on the moon that were unrecoverable.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:32.280
The bottom line was that lunar module had a bunch of failure modes. And it only had life support for two people for three days. And the minimum time to launch a rescue mission was three days.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:50.000
There was just no way to get those guys. It was impossible. And so, each time they tried it, they were taking huge risks. And, you know, take the hint. Everybody that flew Apollo, with the exception of one, were military test pilots.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:24:01.040
Like, if you think it was not a military mission, like, you're fooling yourself. And only on Apollo 17 do you have Harrison Schmidt, who was a geologist, the only scientist to walk on the moon.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.920
Yeah. And there's some funny stories of him getting over-exuberant.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.160
Yes.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.200
And just going after the science, almost to his own risk or detriment.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:25.440
Well, this is the rewrite of this story. So, I mean, the original moon-based geek out I did back in 2017. And much like every other geek out. It's, you know, they're fun. You get them done. You move on. But in this case, a few months later, I got a phone call from NASA.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:33.480
Which, I mean, it's not, I would say this. It's not the first time I got a call from NASA, which is a ridiculous thing to say.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.400
That's awesome.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:44.960
When we did the space telescopes geek out, NASA called and said, hey, would you like to see a space telescope? We got the James Webb over here in Washington. I'm like, yeah, yeah, I would. And we went.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.420
And I also got a chance.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:46.800
Packing my badge right now.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:55.520
And we did some other shows around that, too. I actually got to interview an amazing fellow who subsequently passed away about building spacecraft.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:10.760
But, yeah, this call was from Ames, which is a facility in California. And they did something different. It wasn't just like, hey, do you want to come for a tour? We really like your podcast. It was like, hey, we really like your podcast. Have you ever thought about doing a presentation on it?

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:25.220
I'm like, no, but, and it's like, well, you know, we'd love to see it. And like, you want to see me do a presentation about the moon? I'm like, yeah. It's like, it's your stuff, right? Like, I'm reading your stuff.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.840
Like, yeah, we know. Okay.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.660
But we love the way you tell the story.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:38.140
It's just a good story, right? And so, yeah, there's a picture. And if you've seen the slide deck or the video, there's a picture of driving into Ames.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:47.740
And the big board in the entranceway of Ames has my name on it as the, you know, moon gateway to the solar system, which is a good day, right? I took that picture.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.160
You're like a bucket list item check.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:50.420
Yeah.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.980
I didn't know this was on my bucket list, but it was now.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:07.480
Actually, I got to stay in the hotel at the Ames facility, which is like basically only for NASA people and managed to, you know, beg a second day just because I couldn't get over that I was there, right? Like that was really a thing.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.960
That's beautiful.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:28.200
Yeah. And so the fun part, that was enough. At that point, I'm already blown away, totally excited. That was amazing. Let it go. But then I mentioned it on the show that all that craziness had happened. And I think it was a conference in New Zealand, a conference called Co-mania, that reached out to me and said, well, we love that story. Do you think you could do it as a keynote?

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:55.300
For our conference, just sort of an inspiration piece. And I'm like, yeah, okay. But that's different. It was one thing. The presentation to NASA people is one thing. The presentation to tech people is another thing. And so, and then it ballooned. Like I've done a bunch of them and used a few different videos and I've rewritten a couple of times. Like I've now emphasized the latest version of that where I emphasize Harrison Smith is really talking about what we would do on the moon.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:08.040
Like what's the point? Not just going there to go there, but it's like, right, right. We don't really have anything to prove anymore. And if we could do a 1960s technology, surely you can do it again.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:15.160
But you can do it with 1960s technology with a constant risk of death where you're literally rolling the dice each time you do it.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.740
I feel like back in that era, people just accepted more risk.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:25.200
Well, there's more tragedy, you know, but they were also soldiers, right?

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:32.500
Like that was their job and they were on a mission. It may have been wrapped in a banner of science and stuff. It was a military mission.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:32.960
Yeah. Yeah.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:40.720
There are American military people at risk at this moment all over the world, right? It's, they are a very unusual group of people.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.000
I think I have tremendous respect for them. They take tremendous chances.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.740
Yeah, it's true.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:50.460
But if we're really going to get into scientists work on the moon, scientists are good at math.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.880
They're not going to take that kind of risk.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.060
They can calculate the odds and they know what's going on.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:55.800
Nope, not going.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:01.900
I would bet though that there are some scientists that are so dedicated to what they could discover.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.180
They would take a lot of risk.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:08.460
I tend to agree. And certainly, you know, and plus also mitigate some of this risk as well.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:15.340
We can, it doesn't make sense to do this camping trip approach to the moon.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:20.040
You can't dash in, you know, try and gather some rocks and dash back out.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.040
Real science takes time.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:28.320
The challenge here, and I bring this up when we talk about Harrison Schmidt, it doesn't matter how much you train a test pilot to look for rocks.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.060
The rock you're looking for is an exception.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:37.760
What you actually need to know is what is normal in rocks, and that is a lifetime of training as a geologist.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.960
But when you put a geologist in that place, they make real discoveries.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.380
Because real discoveries are not Eureka, I found it.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.280
It's, what the heck is that?

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.100
Right?

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.820
It's what is anomalous.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.300
Yeah, one of those discoveries on the moon was made by, what was the guy's name who's a geologist?

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:53.980
Harrison Schmidt.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.960
By Harrison Schmidt.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.180
Yeah.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:29:00.000
Was about the volcanic behavior or features of the moon, right?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.840
Yeah, it was an unshocked piece of olivine from the moon, which to a geologist is a huge deal, and everybody else is just a bunch of syllables, right?

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:15.100
But the point was, this rock only forms under high pressures, and there's only two forms of pressure that matter.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:21.860
Either volcanic activity inside of a body or meteoric impacts, but they look different.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:30.180
So, it was not only a piece of olivine, but it was not shocked, because meteorotic impacts create shock, which is a particular look to the stone.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:36.060
This one had been spat onto the surface of the moon in a volcanic eruption.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:42.460
So, it was clear proof of eruption and clear proof of extensive volcanic activity on the moon.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:49.640
So, it spoke to a bunch of understanding about the moon's formation, and it was just one rock.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:57.320
And from a guy who got three days to look for rocks on the moon in an area maybe two kilometers across.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:08.200
One of the things that you mentioned before was all the times that humans have visited the moon, they've visited something like the equivalent of the Sahara Desert.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:08.440
Right.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.800
Space, right?

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.440
So, how much do you really know?

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.840
We don't know very much.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:21.280
You know, just a few days in six locations in a very narrow band of the moon because of the limitations of the spacecraft and the technology at the time.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:28.920
And part of what came out of Apollo was this belief that the moon wasn't worth it because of that limited amount of data.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.900
There just wasn't the resources there.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.120
We've learned.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.180
It's like, we went to the Sahara.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:33.620
Yeah.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.320
There's not really many plants or not much water to work with.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:36.560
Yeah.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.600
Didn't find a Starbucks.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.660
Don't bother.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.400
But subsequent spacecraft, right?

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:55.900
Lunar Prospector and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and LADEE and these other spacecraft that have gone to the moon since then and given us much more detail and understanding of it have demonstrated categorically that there is water on the moon.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:25.880
When it's on the moon, it's on the moon.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:32.060
It gives us a possibility of decreasing the cost of operating there.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:39.640
And any technology we develop on the moon to be able to do those things is useful elsewhere in the solar system.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.320
Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:45.600
Well, also, the moon could be a gateway to further exploration, right?

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.480
If you could get water, maybe you could somehow manufacture fuel, hydrogen or something.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:50.760
Yeah.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.760
It's much easier to fly away from the moon than it is from the sun.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.700
I'm sorry, from the Earth.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.080
Yes.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:07.980
Well, so we talk about the cost of travel in space in a term called delta V or the amount of energy, amount of power you need to change your vector, change your delta.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:15.720
And so escaping the Earth, getting into low Earth orbit is roughly 12 to 13 kilometers per second of delta V.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.420
And on the moon, it's two.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:17.800
Wow.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.260
Yeah.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:18.580
Right.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.900
Once you're in low Earth orbit, the energy to get to the moon again is, I mean, two.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.320
And the energy to get to Mars is three.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.960
You know, this is Robert Heinlein's old line is, once you're in low Earth orbit, you're halfway to everywhere.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.940
Yeah, that's about true.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.100
As long as you got time.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:48.900
Well, and so the point being that if we can manufacture fuel on the moon and figure out how to refuel spacecraft doing that, we can build bigger ships and go further and do more.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:56.720
As long as you're pulling things out of this pretty hefty gravity well on Earth, the costs are going to be high.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:56.960
Right.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.800
And you're burning up the entire delicate space machine every time.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:08.280
Well, then that's part of the challenge of the rocket equation makes us be that efficient, right?

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:15.220
That intense, that 98% of the vehicle will be consumed in the process of getting the 2% into orbit.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:15.500
Yeah.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.280
But we've made improvements on that, right?

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.620
This is SpaceX's magic is the recovery of the first day.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:28.920
That to me really signifies a tremendous shift in how space is done.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.200
Because you see the Saturn V go up and it gets destroyed.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:39.620
The space shuttle, ride that, but it was trying to be too many things, too many people and became...

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.580
It's a white elephant.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.200
It can't be used, right?

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.300
It was just too complicated.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.840
It was too fragile.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:53.400
And so the reason it wasn't reusable weekly is the amount of maintenance that it needed, right?

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:59.800
That it was tens of thousands of hours each time you flew a shuttle to get it ready to fly again.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.860
It's all wages.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:08.740
It's people dismantling the vehicle and inspecting everything and repairing what needed to be repaired and reassembling it.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:14.380
A jet airliner wouldn't be profitable if you had to dismantle it every time you flew it.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.260
That trip to Europe was super expensive.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.220
We threw away the 747 or the A380.

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:26.560
Well, even if you didn't throw it away, if you just took it apart and put it back together again, A, it takes a month, right?

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.860
And B, you've got to pay all the people that do that.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.420
It's expensive, right?

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.160
You're not actually fully discarding it.

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.180
They were discarding relatively cheap pieces of it.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:40.340
But the labor of restoring the orbiter to flight status again was just too high.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:45.540
And it kept getting higher as they learned more failure modes, that they understood the vehicle better.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.820
And as the vehicles aged, it got more expensive.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:49.260
Absolutely.

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:56.440
So one of the angles that you've been thinking about here is, let me step back and ask a question that we can go down that path.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:56.880
Sure.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:13.140
So to me, it seems like, I don't know, it's basically since I've been paying attention that NASA bounces from focus to focus or project to project to project without really getting going, right?

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.760
Like, we're going to go set up a base here.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.160
We're going to fly to Mars and spend some time there.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:26.280
You know, it seems like every time that there's new presidents or new administration or something, there's always like, that was great.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.040
We're not doing that.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:27.300
Yeah.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.300
What we're going to do is this.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.980
It's not up to NASA, right?

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.700
NASA does not set its own agenda.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.900
It has ideas.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.700
It makes proposals.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.640
But you've got two forces acting there.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:42.440
You have the executive that nominally is deciding on missions and sort of putting emphasis on things.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:42.600
Right.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.880
They're kind of fickle.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.280
Yeah.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:50.200
And then you've got the politicians pouring like sand and molasses into it to make sure that their people still get paid.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.640
Well, the Congress ultimately controls the Perth.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:59.580
And so the budget that goes to NASA is based on congressional needs.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.640
And this, you know, this is where you get space launch system from.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.700
The space launch system.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.920
That's their latest huge rocket.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.320
And it's not that late.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.540
The basic design of the space launch system came in the 90s.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.520
Right.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.080
It was repurposed space shuttle hardware.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.140
Solid rocket boosters extended.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.700
Same basic tank designs.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.860
Literally the same engines as the shuttle.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:29.740
So it was what if we, you know, the space shuttle itself weighs nearly 100 metric tons and we take it up and over and bring it back.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.020
What if we didn't use a shuttle anymore?

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:36.280
What if we use that 100 metric tons for lift for actual usable payload?

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.580
That's the essence of the SLS.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:41.360
It was called constellation before that.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.260
But the reality was that it didn't have a mission.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.420
Right.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.880
You can't just build a rock because you want to build a rocket.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.000
It needs a mission.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.860
Right.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.400
It needs constraints and a goal that you build around.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:53.600
Yeah.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.260
And so you keep proposing different missions that repurpose the hardware.

00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:02.960
Even NASA, when they didn't have a mission, said, well, we should stop spending money on this new rocket.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:11.840
But then the Congress would step in and insist on funding it because Congress has Congress members have constituents and those constituents want to stay employed.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:27.080
And when NASA was set up in the 60s, they did a very good job of making sure that there were offices in lots of different states that all collaborated to build these projects, which meant many congressmen were affected by what happened with NASA.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:34.640
And so NASA kept getting funding for a rocket they didn't have a mission for, but only enough to keep everybody employed.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.040
So they'd never bent any metal.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.640
They didn't actually make anything.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:50.200
But a crazy thing happened over the intervening 30 years that kind of finished the plan with minimum funding to the point where it's like, all we've really got left to do now is bend the metal.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.880
We kind of got this figured out.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.160
Right.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.560
So it's a cool rocket.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.600
It's just a cool rocket if it was 1995.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.520
Yeah.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:05.360
It looks a little obsolete in the face of SpaceX and Blue Origin and even the new Vulcan from ULA.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.860

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.600
They're hiring.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.720
Go to linode.com slash careers to find out more.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.060
Let them know that we sent you.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.860
Yeah, Blue Origin being the one from Bezos' company.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:15.420
Yes, and we really, you know, Bezos' new Shepard is not a big deal rocket, right?

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.120
It's a toy.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:31.020
It's a technology demonstrator possibly used for tourism, although I don't think any of these tourism rockets are ever going to go anywhere because we're just so close to economically viable orbital tourism that the suborbital stuff may not amount to anything.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:37.800
But he's bending metal right now on New Glenn, and New Glenn probably renders SLS obsolete.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:45.000
It's a seven-meter rocket with modern engines and a modern design, probably a reasonable first stage.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.680
Not that he's done it yet.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.860
We won't know until it works.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.020
But we know it's possible.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.600
Yeah, we've definitely seen first stages land.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:58.600
The New Glenn first stage will be twice the size of the Falcon 9 first stage.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.060
So it's a beast.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:06.740
But yeah, once that rocket flies, you're going to look at SLS and go, does this make any sense?

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:07.100
Yeah.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.280
Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:22.380
Well, so the direction I was going with my question is you've talked about having a moon base would add some political stability for organizations like NASA or other participants, right?

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:38.360
Well, one of the things that NASA has learned to do, and this has really came about with the space station, was if you get international agreements to do something in space, you're creating things that persist from administration to administration and from Congress to Congress.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:45.040
So one of the reasons the international space station has been successful is that you can't change on a whim.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.540
You have agreements in place.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.820
And that, to me, is what makes the lunar gateway make so much sense.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.480
That they want to build a space station around the moon.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.260
And they want it to be international.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:57.880
They want it.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.400
A, I think they want a do-over.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.840
There's problems with the space station.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.980
They've learned some things.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.820
They'd like to build a new station with the new things they know.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:05.960
You know what some of the problems are?

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.280
Yeah.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.200
I mean, one of the...

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.320
So, A, it's actually too big.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:14.460
It's so large, there's a non-trivial amount of time spent finding things.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.700
There are so many storage locations, it's easy to lose things.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.880
And so they spend a lot of time looking for stuff.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:29.040
A new station will have a better storage management solution that is much more carefully organized so that you don't waste so much time looking for stuff.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.700
It can't do its own station keeping.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:36.880
Even though it's 400 kilometers up, it's low enough, the atmosphere is still dragging on it.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.900
And so it needs constant reboost.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:51.560
That means every time a Soyuz or a Progress or an H-2, any of these different ships visit, one of the things they do is they give it a little push to get it higher in its orbit, to persist its orbit.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.460
It can't be untended.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.380
You need people in it all the time.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:42:02.600
There's enough maintenance and fragility going on inside that vehicle that if it was left untended for just a few months, it's very likely it would break down.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:02.860
Wow.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:03.420
Okay.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:17.200
And to build a new station that is man-tended, that will function well on its own for certain periods of time, maybe six months at a go, can do its own station keeping and is better organized.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.420
And all of those things are checked off in the design for Lunar Gateway.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.340
It's a better design.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:27.060
Now, that's not a good enough reason to build a space, but there's also particular things it can do.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.780
It is outside of the Van Allen Belt.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.840
It's in orbit around the moon.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.160
So, extended exposure to higher radiation levels.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:40.740
So, understanding more about that radiation environment, how equipment stands up, and man-rated equipment can survive in those environments.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:47.380
The particular orbit they pick, which is an unusual orbit, orbits close to the north side of the moon and then distant to the south side.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.040
It's called a near-rectilinear halo orbit.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.880
And it has a bunch of advantages.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.260
One is that it is always in view of the Earth.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.320
It's also always in view of the sun.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:04.040
So, you don't have the complexities with solar power that you have on the International Space Station, where it spends 45 minutes in light, 45 minutes in dark.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.960
Like, you just think about what that would do to a battery.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.860
That you discharge it for 45 minutes and you charge it again.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.580
Then you discharge it for 45 minutes and you charge it again.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.640
The way they would set up Lunar Gateway, you'd just be in the sun all the time.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:21.500
And you have this seven-day orbit, this one-week orbit, where six of the days you have a good view of the south pole.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.660
So, there's a lot of science that can be done that way.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:28.000
It's easier to teleoperate robots from that position.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.700
You're about a second away when you're back on the Earth and you don't have a good view of the south pole anyway.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:38.980
So, that particular orbit allows them to do work remotely on the south pole pretty efficiently.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:39.380
Right.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.980
And there's a lot of interesting things about that.

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:48.920
First of all, speaking about the orbit, one of the big challenges is that the moon doesn't have even gravity.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.220
Yes.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.500
Consistent, smooth gravity like the Earth does.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:52.720
Right.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:59.380
So, a circular orbit gets wobbly or weird or something like that, right?

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:05.980
Well, there's variations of plus or minus 2% due to these things called mass cons or mass concentrations.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:16.360
And that's enough to destabilize an orbit that if you don't do station keeping, you eventually will lose control and plow into the moon sooner or later.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.100
It cleans its own self up.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.760
The longest operating vehicle orbiting the moon now is the lunar constant orbiter at 10 years.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:30.620
But one of the reasons the LRO works so well is it has a particular orbit where most of the time it's not that close to the moon.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.180
It orbits away from the moon, then it comes back in.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:40.200
But the orbit shifts so that it has these great, all the photographs you've seen of the moon, the pictures of the Apollo landing sites, that all came from LRO.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.960
And it's been carefully nursing its view.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:44.100
Right.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.720
Like the footprint in the dust type of pictures.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:46.920
Yes.

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.640
Or other crashed orbiters or landers that didn't quite make it.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:50.900
Yes.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.600
All of those things come from LRO.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:45:00.660
And so LRO is mapped something like 98% of the moon, the 2% being the continuously shaded areas that it can't actually see into.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.860
But otherwise, you know, everything else plows into it.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.680
But this near rectilinear halo orbit is same thing.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.680
It needs some station keeping, but very little.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:20.140
And the station keeping module they want for Lunar Gateway is a Maxar designed ion engine thrust unit, Hall Effect engine, about 10 metric times.

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.580
That just seems like science fiction.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:22.260
Totally is.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:26.880
And it's the, you know, we've had Hall Effect thrusters for quite a while for smaller satellites.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.380
This by far would be the biggest one.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.820
And it's already been ordered.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.900
Like NASA has ordered two of them.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.300
The design is actually 10 years old.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:42.620
It was originally developed for the asteroid redirect mission, and now it's been repurposed into the station keeping for the Lunar Gateway.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.380
So they're going to build them.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:47.100
Now, whether or not they're actually going to build Lunar Gateway is another question entirely.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:47.640
Right, right.

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.500
But they'll have these engines hanging around for something.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.100
Yeah, they could make them into something, right?

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.060
But Congress has yet to fund any of this.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:59.480
What's being asked for is not a huge amount of money in the scheme of things.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:03.560
It's about $5 billion a year, $30 billion over six years.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:11.860
That takes NASA's funding from 0.48% to 0.72% of the national budget.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:12.080
Yeah.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.200
But that would be in their proposal.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:22.100
That's enough for the four Artemis missions, the SLS missions, to build the Gateway and to land humans back on the moon by 2024.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.720
Well, I think it would be super inspiring to do.

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.820
But would it be maybe also practical?

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:45.380
So one thing, you know, just thinking about all this stuff as we're talking and, you know, other times as well, it's just it seems like there's obvious basic infrastructure that could be in place that would make future work, future exploration, future missions much cheaper.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:57.080
So, for example, if there was some mechanism to shoot stuff up and stage it, almost like a warehouse type of place, like the space station, but maybe not that thing actually.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:02.060
Put supplies up there, click them together and then shoot them off.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:21.120
You know, you could do some Falcons fly up there, reuse a lot of pieces and then send more stuff or having, you know, a base on the moon that could refuel things or having, you know, maybe a gravity driven sort of round trip set of like buses almost or trucks just going around and around.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.260
That you can just, hey, we're going to hitch a ride the next one comes in two days type of thing.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:30.260
Like, could stuff like that come out of this that would then make many things cheaper in the future?

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:30.780
Yeah.

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:31.040
What do you think?

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:39.040
You understand that most of the rockets we have operating today, the most efficient ones we have, only have enough power to put things into low Earth orbit.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:45.600
We work so hard to get rockets out of the Earth's gravity that we don't have a lot of excess capacity afterwards.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:50.560
And so it's not simple to make a rocket more powerful than simply fly to the moon.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.300
It's more complicated than that.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:48:02.600
But if we're going to stay, if we're going to spend extended periods of time on the moon, rather in orbit in that lunar gateway or on the surface, it makes sense to start building tugs.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.880
Especially cargo tugs.

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:11.120
So that same module I was talking about, the station keep module for the lunar gateway would also serve very well as a tug.

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:30.000
So you use a Falcon 9, which pretty much uses itself up to get 20 metric tons to low Earth orbit or even 10 metric tons to low Earth orbit, where it's met by a tug that then uses its Hall effect thrusters, its ion engines, to fly the payload the rest of the way to the moon.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:35.540
Now it's not going to fly to the moon the way you think of in science fiction, where it's like point at the moon, press a button, off we go.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:39.300
It's actually got, the Hall effect thrusters are very low thrust.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:44.780
Like so low thrust, the amount of thrust is the equivalent of you holding two apples in your hand.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.980
Like the pressure that's on your hand when you're holding two apples.

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.020
That's how much thrust we're talking about.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.080
Which doesn't seem like much, but it's super consistent.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:57.060
But so the way that you actually go to the moon with that kind of thrusters is you use what's called the Oberth effect.

00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:07.780
So when you're on the far side of the Earth from the moon, you fire these thrusters for about 15 minutes and it raises your orbit towards the moon a little bit.

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:12.840
Then you go around in orbit and when you get back to that far side again, you fire them again.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:22.420
So over a period of two weeks, you gradually raise your orbit until you're going to intersect the lunar gravity.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.440
You're going to go into the lunar orbit.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.000
And that point, when you go out there, you're going to get to the moon.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.260
You're going to fly to the far side of the moon.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:36.280
You're going to fire in the opposite direction and start pulling your orbit in so that you no longer fly behind the Earth anymore.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:42.080
Until gradually over another week or so, you reduce your orbit into or just around the moon.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:46.080
Now, so you're talking a month to move a payload to the moon.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.680
What's the upside?

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:51.080
The upside is you can do it over and over and over again.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.760
It's very little fuel.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.260
It's very efficient flying, but it takes a lot of time.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:00.900
So it's not good for humans because that whole time humans are being exposed to radiation and needing to eat.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.880
But for cargo, it's great.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.860
Yeah, absolutely.

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:09.040
Well, and if you had 30 of them going all offset by a day, you could send stuff up daily.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.000
It just would take a month to show up.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:11.860
You could actually get there.

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:12.480
Yeah.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:24.980
And so now you get back to, this is the other advantage of that lunar gateway is once you have the gateway there, which is unique, and a one-off kind of thing you build, now you put on another commercial license, a commercial contract.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:33.020
The same way you have commercial resupply to the International Space Station, you have commercial resupply to the lunar gateway, which are much less expensive missions.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.480
And they're actually incented to get cheaper.

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:43.560
Now you're paying a flat rate per kilo for supply, and the company's opportunity to make money is to get less expensive over time.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:48.820
You know, those first few missions that SpaceX flew to the space station didn't make them much money.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:53.120
But as they got better at it and more efficient at it, they started making more money off that contract.

00:50:53.120 --> 00:51:02.400
Well, and there was this piece of news recently about SpaceX and Boeing both sending folks up to the space station.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:11.000
And the Boeing, folks, the Boeing contract was like 60% more than what SpaceX was getting for the same thing is something like that.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:11.900
Is that, did I read that right?

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.980
Yeah, you're correct.

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:22.780
And again, you know, normally Boeing and United Launch Alliance, which is the conglomerate of Lockheed Martin and Boeing together that used to fly the shuttle and now flies Atlas V and Delta IVs.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:26.240
All of their contracts are what are called cost plus contracts.

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.760
And this is kind of normal in the military, and it's been normal for NASA as well.

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:35.480
But cost plus contract essentially says, here is what we want you to achieve.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.360
And we tolerate no failure.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.620
You're going to make sure it's perfect.

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:42.540
And if you get it done on time, you'll get this additional bonus.

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:44.880
And if you meet these milestones, you'll get this bonus.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.160
The problem with that contract is you're not incented to improve.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.680
You're only incented to make sure it works.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:56.100
And so, and in fact, if you spend more money making sure it works, you're going to get that money.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:56.360
Yeah.

00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:02.360
So you're actually advantaged to sort of blow budgets to some degree and make to just to be absolutely certain.

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:07.280
And so you tend to build a lot of bureaucracy, a lot of testing and more testing and, you know,

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:12.820
testing that may not actually do much, but increases certainty that the thing's going to fly successfully.

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:15.980
And you can't argue with like the Atlas V's flight success rate.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:16.960
It's 100%.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:22.540
But at extreme, at a $25,000 a kilo to low Earth orbit price range, right?

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:25.100
Where SpaceX is literally a tenth of that.

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:32.940
These fixed cost contracts that NASA's had for a few years, the COTS contracts, actually incent companies to get more efficient.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:40.200
Until SpaceX started working on Crew Dragon, no Falcon 9 flight was the same.

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:45.380
They modified the rocket every time it flew, always making improvements.

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:49.440
This is something that never happened in the Atlas V's.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.640
They don't improve them because that's not how the contract is structured.

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:52.920
Right.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.400
Now, there's no incentive for it, right?

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.800
And even Falcon 9 is no longer being modified.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:07.080
And the reason it's no longer being modified is that part of the crew qualifications is that identical hardware flies multiple times with success.

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:14.820
So in order to qualify to actually lift crews to the space station under those rules, they can't change the rocket anymore.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.080
Yeah.

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:18.160
Now, the good news is they've kind of tweaked out Falcon 9.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:24.420
Like Falcon 9 full thrust Rev 5 is as much as they're going to get out of that rocket design.

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.460
There's not a lot left to do there anymore.

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:27.840
Yeah.

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.680
The Falcon 9 is pretty amazing.

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:33.820
The Falcon Heavy really captured my imagination watching that go off.

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:34.000
Yeah.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:34.920
You're not alone.

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.520
Everybody loved the Falcon Heavy.

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:37.120
Oh my goodness.

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.540
It doesn't help that he flew a sports car.

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:42.000
I know not everyone out there is listening is like following all the SpaceX rockets.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.380
So maybe like a quick description of this whole, what it is and that whole event for everyone.

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:54.660
Well, Falcon Heavy was a proposal in the early stages of Falcon 9 when Falcon 9 was substantially smaller, right?

00:53:54.660 --> 00:54:01.620
They've used the same name over and again, but there's been five versions of the rocket and it's gotten bigger, taller, not wider.

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.720
It's always been 3.7 meters across.

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.520
Falcon Heavy was saying, hey, let's strap three of them together, right?

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.240
That'll work.

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.100
That'll be cool.

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:12.460
Which is a much harder problem than you actually think.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:19.560
But when it wasn't, when Falcon 9 hadn't been tricked out as far as it has, it made more sense.

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:26.240
But as they continued to improve Falcon 9, they got to a point where Falcon Heavy almost didn't make sense.

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:33.020
And Elon actually seriously considered never flying a Falcon Heavy, but he finally got to a point where they were close enough that they wanted to test it.

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.680
It has some reusability benefits.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:40.940
And so the original Falcon 9 flight in February of 2018, they needed a test payload.

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:47.540
Now look, every other space company flies a block of concrete.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:50.480
And Elon's like, that's so boring.

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.340
Fly my sports car.

00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:53.400
It's the same weight.

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:58.880
So he literally took one of the original Tesla Roadsters and that was the payload.

00:54:58.880 --> 00:54:59.980
Oh, no, that wasn't enough.

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:05.560
They also put an early space suit set up like a mannequin sitting in the seat.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.540
They put Don't Panic on the screen.

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:13.660
They put a Lego car of the Tesla Roadster on the dashboard.

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:15.340
And that was the payload.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.200
And they put the top down and a camera on it.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.620
And many cameras on it.

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:22.120
And they only had power for a couple of hours.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:22.940
Right.

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:27.640
And what they were really doing is they, you know, they were doing a proper rocket test in the sense of, yeah, they flew it.

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:32.580
And then they burned the second stage as hard as they could just to see how far it would actually fly.

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:36.840
And effectively put it into an orbit that goes beyond the orbit of Mars.

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.140
But the footage was astonishing.

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:47.120
The second stage, the outside boosters landed just like the videos, the CGI's they'd made of it.

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.720
And it was incredibly inspiring.

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:55.060
It was one of those few times that transcends national boundaries.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:56:00.020
It was one of those moments where all of humanity was like, look what we can do.

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:04.260
Admittedly, what we could do was fly a red sports car to an orbit beyond Mars.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.280
But, you know, which is hilarious.

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.860
You're a wild billionaire.

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:08.540
That's.

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:08.940
Yeah.

00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:09.480
You know.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.800
That's not a bad demonstration.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:19.240
If you think a couple of hundred years in the future when they're writing the history, they're going to talk about this period of these crazy billionaires.

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:25.680
And the fact that one of them flew a sport, his own sports car into space, ruining it.

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:28.680
You know, it's going to, the paint's going to have peeled off.

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.600
The tires are going to be racked.

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.320
Like, it's ridiculous.

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.780
But for that moment, it's like, things are different.

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:38.080
The Falcon Heavy has got a problem.

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.240
The problem is thing called the fineness ratio.

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.920
So the rocket's only 3.7 meters wide.

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:49.840
And there's a basic rule of rocketry that says you really shouldn't be more than 15 times taller your width.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.500
And it's not easy to make it wider because it has to drive.

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:53.560
It's a different rocket at that point.

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.400
Well, it changes the rocket.

00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.380
If you're going to make it wider, you're making a different rocket.

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:01.000
You can make a rocket taller, but only up to a certain point.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.800
And the Falcon 9 full thrust, the latest version, is 18 to 1.

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.420
It is already past the safe ratio of the fineness ratio.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:16.260
And the problem now is you get these flexing moments where you're going to bend the rocket and it'll tear itself apart.

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.180
And so it's very challenging to do anything with it.

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.420
And the issue is this.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:25.040
The payload fairing on a Falcon Heavy is 5 meters wide.

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.480
And it's 13 meters long.

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.740
It's actually a relatively small payload fairing.

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:31.460
There's not enough room in it.

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:36.660
It's enough room to put a school bus in, which sounds like a lot of room, but it's not a lot of room in space world.

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.800
You've got this rocket with a tremendous amount of power.

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:44.120
It can lift a lot of stuff, but you can't get a big enough fairing on it for the bigger stuff.

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:47.400
You couldn't lift space station components in that fairing.

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.220
You need something bigger.

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:53.840
And you can make a fairing larger than the rocket, but not when it's this long.

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:59.420
So they're kind of at the limit of its flexing thing on the front.

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:00.740
It's just not going to make it easier.

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.880
No, it's going to likely tear the rocket apart.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:12.900
And so that's why they've sort of walked, moved away from Falcon Heavy for certain payloads for heavy, dense, smaller payloads that want to go to geostationary orbit.

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:23.200
The fact that it can lift seven metric tons to geostationary orbit, fully reusable, that you get the all three boosters back is astonishing.

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:27.300
That reduces the price to GTO tremendously.

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:33.960
That's more interesting than the fact that it could lift 50 metric tons fully expended.

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:37.980
Because there's no 50 metric ton payload that'll fit in that little space.

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.880
Are you shipping pure uranium?

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:40.340
Yeah.

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:41.880
You know, you're on it.

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.940
It's like we don't make anything that's that small, that's that heavy.

00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:47.240
Right.

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:59.220
Well, the other thing that SpaceX is working on that's farther out there in the science fiction side of things is that silver giant rocket called Starship.

00:58:59.220 --> 00:58:59.520
Yes.

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:04.220
Which is meant to be 100% reusable and it's supposed to be the thing that takes people to Mars.

00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:11.760
So what Elon's doing is he went from a small airliner to I want to build a 747.

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:14.200
If he pulls it off, it changes everything.

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:14.800
Right.

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.900
A DC-3 or DC-9 or whatever.

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:17.280
Yeah.

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.540
From a DC-3 to an A380 without intervening.

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:29.280
Like the logical thing for him to do now, now that you know it's the 3.7 meter constraint on the Falcon 9 that's the problem, is he should build a 7 meter rocket.

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.460
Something twice the width.

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:31.060
Right.

00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:38.480
He's got the Raptor engine, which is his high performance methane engine that seems to be working, knocking out the last of the bugs on that.

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:48.980
A 7 meter rocket or maybe a 10 meter rocket, but basically the same design, bigger payload, bigger fairing, reusable first stage, non-reusable second stage.

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:52.620
Nobody would doubt for a second that Elon could make that rocket.

00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:55.260
He's already done it with an orbital class rocket.

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.680
It's totally feasible.

00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.480
And the joke, of course, is that Jeff Bezos is building that rocket.

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.140
That's New Glenn.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:04.180
But Bezos were not as convinced he can build it because he's never built an orbital class rocket before.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:07.380
But the rocket he's producing in New Glenn is exactly that.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.480
A 7 meter rocket with the first stage being reusable.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.460
Starship is the step beyond.

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.880
It's going for 100% reusability.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.340
The booster stage, the first stage.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:21.040
It's even more reusable than the space shuttle.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:21.780
Well, absolutely.

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.680
Because everything's going to come back.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.100
There's no used up parts.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:26.960
There's not that giant tank.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.420
What we don't know is how much maintenance it needs.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:41.420
Because SpaceX is privately held, he's never actually admitted how much work needs to be done to the first stage of a Falcon 9 after it's returned.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.440
We know he's flown at least one of them four times.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.900
Which is impressive.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.220
And if you fly them ten times, that's awesome.

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.180
It's got to be less than the space shuttle, though.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.200
Because you're not servicing an entire airplane, effectively.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:53.660
Yes.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.380
Plus two rockets.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.260
It's just rocket bits.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.180
A pair of tanks and nine engines.

01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:04.040
And there is an issue with the engines, which is that the Merlin engines run a Kerilox.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:08.480
So that's RP1, which is a kind of highly refined kerosene and liquid oxygen.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.240
Great fuel, but it's a hydrocarbon.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.380
And so when it gets up to altitude, those hydrocarbons, they have a lot of soot in them.

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:22.700
And they tend to acid etch the bells of the engines.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:26.680
So there's a question as to how long those Merlin engines will last.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:30.080
And this is different from long firings at sea level.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.360
It's specifically at low pressures that you have problems with RP1 etching.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.380
So, and it's again, stuff he's never talked about publicly is how much damage are those

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:45.540
engines actually taking going up to 60 kilometers or so, which is about as high as they get before

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.540
they turn around and come back.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:50.540
Switching over to methane engines, we don't have that problem, right?

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:54.820
So the new engines that are supposed to be part of Starship and that also New Glenn is using

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.840
burning methane and liquid oxygen.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.280
So the Methalox design burns a lot cleaner.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.760
It doesn't have the same residues.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.380
It's better for reusable engines.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.560
More efficient.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.920
It's somewhat simpler in the plumbing side and it lends itself to a more expensive engine,

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.860
but a more reusable engine.

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:18.140
So we're only just starting to modify the way we make rockets based on the fact that you might

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:19.620
use them multiple times.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.280
You know, an example of this on the Falcon 9 were the grid fins.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:29.560
Original grid fins were made of aircraft grade aluminum and they burned on re-entry.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.080
They took a lot of damage.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.900
They were good for one flight essentially.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:33.760
And then they were damaged enough.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:34.540
You had to replace them.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.040
But once he realized he was going to get multiple flights out of these rockets, he started making

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:38.960
titanium ones.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.180
Titanium ones are dramatically more expensive, much more difficult to make.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.960
But if you're going to get 10 uses out of them, great.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.040
Makes total sense.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.780
They're actually even lighter than the aluminum ones.

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:54.040
But same thing with engine design.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.000
The Merlins were built as the most efficient and they truly are the most efficient Karalox engines

01:02:59.000 --> 01:02:59.880
ever made.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:05.720
But we don't really know how they're going to behave over a dozen launches and all of the

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.480
impacts that have.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.420
And so moving over the Raptor engines and the Metalox design lends itself to more reusability

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:11.940
in that area.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.420
But the big dumb booster part of Starship, they know they can build that.

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.360
In fact, they're not even trying to build that right now.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.820
They're trying to build Starship because Starship is pushing impossible.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.400
Like this is nuts.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:31.940
The 100 metric ton payload vehicle that can go up to orbital velocities and come back and

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:35.000
not burn up and not need to be rebuilt.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.340
Yeah.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.120
It's incredible.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.600
The big thing if it works is now you have 100% reusable vehicle and you're starting to

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.980
pay for fuel and maintenance instead of new components.

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:49.540
And so where Falcon 9 is coming in at under $2,000 a kilo, now we're talking under $20 a

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:50.860
kilo to orbit.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:56.600
And that is regular people going to space pricing.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.240
That would dramatically change things, wouldn't it?

01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:58.540
It would.

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:03.300
Well, one of the craziest things to think about when you think about Starship, if it works

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.680
the way it's supposed to and as reliable as it should be, is that means it's less than

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.060
an hour to any point on Earth.

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:08.300
Right.

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.780
It becomes like a really fast airplane that just happens to go in space.

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:13.320
Yeah, it just happens.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.480
It takes the shortcut.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.980
It goes up above the atmosphere, moves halfway around the planet and comes back down again.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:23.480
So, you know, you live in New York and you want to have lunch in Sydney.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.180
No problem.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.560
You'll be back for the afternoon.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.900
And at those pricing.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:28.520
That's a whole new level of jet lag.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.100
Well, I don't know if you even have time to get jet lag.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.280
You just turn around, fly back.

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:32.740
Right.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:35.020
Like it's, you know, who's going to adopt?

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.540
Why would you stay overnight anywhere?

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.200
It would just be a weird time to have dinner.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.980
I had breakfast and I felt like it was dinner, but then I went back and had lunch.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.300
Yeah.

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:42.680
Right.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.400
And in those pricings, you're basically talking, if you can afford a first class ticket,

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.520
you can fly an hour anywhere on the planet.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.340
Now, there are some issues.

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:51.940
It's awful noisy.

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:53.880
It's a big machine.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.280
You don't want it anywhere near town.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.840
Like you thought the airport was out of town.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.220
Wait till you see the spaceport.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.740
It's way out of town.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.080
So you might spend longer getting to it than your flight.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.820
And, you know, the maybe can fit a hundred people per flight.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:10.340
So that's a lot of people to fly, find for a point to point flying.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:15.280
That's still a pretty expensive notion, but that's the reality of a hundred percent usable

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.760
reusable spacecraft is that's how big the change is.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.080
Right.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:18.440
Right.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:18.600
Right.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:18.640
Right.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.460
Or you can bring a bunch of stuff up to those tugs you talked about.

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:21.820
Yeah.

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:22.680
Well, keep it moving.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.260
He's also talking about refueling.

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:28.680
So imagine you fly up into orbit, then a fuel tanker comes and refuels you enough that you

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:32.020
just fly the whole vehicle to the moon, land on the moon on your tail.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.340
Cause that's what you can do.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:36.440
You know, take your hundred ton payload and distribute it on it.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.380
By the way, you know, that will be more mass than has ever been taken to the moon so far

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.460
and then fly it back.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:42.740
Yeah.

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:48.460
And if you have the water, you can probably pretty easily with solar power generate methane.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:53.640
well, methane, we need carbon and the moon is somewhat carbon poor.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:56.480
So that's the tricky part about the methane.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.020
Like you can do the liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen is easy with water.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:02.540
The problem is that liquid hydrogen is a terrible fuel.

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:08.640
It's very efficient, but it's incredibly low density and it's intensely hard to store.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:14.980
Liquid oxygen is only a liquid between six degrees Kelvin and 20 degrees Kelvin.

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:19.220
So it's got a very, you know, like water has a hundred degree temperature range where it's

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.880
liquid, liquid hydrogen has a 14 degree range.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.000
And it's a hard degrees to attain that low temperature, right?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It's extremely cold.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.140
And, and, and the substance itself, you know how helium leaks out of your balloon?

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:32.900
Hydrogen is way worse.

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:36.080
It's very, very tough to store.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:36.760
Yeah.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.840
And there's also effects of hydrogen because it's essentially just a proton.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:46.900
There's this whole process called hydrogen embrittlement where these hydrogen atoms actually

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:50.140
invade the metal that's in containing them and alter it.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.140
It is a very difficult fuel to store.

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:58.880
You can use it for a brief amount of time and it has some advantages, but we have not come

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.460
up with storage solutions that work well.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:05.860
Methane's interesting in that space because it's roughly, it operates roughly at the same

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.520
temperatures as a liquid, as liquid oxygen.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.960
Liquid oxygen is much easier to handle.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.480
It's liquid over a larger range.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.660
It's substantially warmer.

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:18.960
We have doers and cryo regeneration systems that maintain it.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.760
And the same gear works for methane as well with a couple of minor tweaks.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.420
So if we can get the carbon producing methane on the moon, makes a lot of sense.

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:33.860
And we already know, you've read Robert Zubrin's case for Mars, plenty of carbon on, on Mars.

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:37.040
So you want to use methane fuel on Mars as well.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.720
The same technologies would apply.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.000
Just a question of where you get the carbon from on the moon.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.360
I'm presuming that some of the mass concentration, those same things that disrupt the gravity

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:51.240
on the moon actually come from large asteroid collisions and that some of those large asteroid

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:56.020
conditions will be chondrotic asteroids, which are the most common kind, which are made largely

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:56.680
of carbon.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.540
So you can imagine we would.

01:07:58.540 --> 01:07:58.720
Right.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:07:59.760
So you can go find it.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:06.320
We'd be mining deposits of carbon, mining deposits of ice and making and storing methane.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:06.680
Yeah.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.980
Amazing.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.640
So we're getting pretty short on time.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:15.400
I just do want to ask you one more question or talk about one more thing real quick on

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:15.820
the moon.

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:19.640
You talked about this north-south elliptical orbit.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.540
The halo or...

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.120
The other thing that's really...

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:21.480
Yeah.

01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:21.880
Yeah.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:29.320
The thing that's really interesting is that there's this huge city of Sydney size crater

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.560
that the rim is always in the sun.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.520
It may have water in it.

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:38.460
And that would be an incredible place to sit down and start working.

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:40.400
You're talking about the Shackleton crater on the south pole.

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.000
Yes, exactly.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:41.360
Yeah.

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:45.520
There are parts of the rim that are lit like 98% of the time.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.960
It's not 100%, but it's close enough that you'd have a lot of solar.

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.400
Although you need so many...

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.480
To get enough power, you need a lot of solar panels.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:02.640
Even when you're in vacuum, you're still only talking 1,300 watts per meter per square meter

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.680
of electricity coming from the sun at this distance.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.860
And so then you have the conversion ratio of the solar panels itself, which is like 25% to

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:11.420
30%.

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.420
All right?

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:19.720
So realistically, you're only getting about 300 to 400 watts per meter of solar panel.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.740
And you need kilowatts.

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.200
Like you need huge solar panels.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.200
You have to get them up there.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.600
I mean, we also have the ingredients on the moon to manufacture solar panels.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.420
So at some point we could get to that there.

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:36.280
But I don't think it's feasible for us to really work on the moon without building small nuclear

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:36.880
power plants.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:44.060
And there are agencies, including the Glenn Agency and NASA, that have developed kilowatt,

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:49.960
compact, sterling engine nuclear power plants that are really safe and stable.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.000
They literally the kind where you would turn this thing on and it would make power for 20

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.220
years and not much, you know, almost no moving parts.

01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.320
Like there's not much to do.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.480
It just operates.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.260
That's amazing.

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:05.620
Well, and the joke about nuclear power is that the Chernobyl's and the three mile islands in

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:11.500
Fukushima is all of the same essential issue, which is that they are old, large designs that

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.580
are hard to manage.

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:17.600
You don't think about the 300 to 400 megawatt reactor designs.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:24.420
You don't think about the hundreds of 60 megawatt reactors that the military have, both American,

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:29.740
Russian, French, British, that you never hear about because they just work.

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:32.920
And because they're small enough that when they have a problem, they can shut them off

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.940
and they don't melt.

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.160
They just shut off.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.960
And we don't even need that much power.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.900
We're talking about a megawatt.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:45.960
Compact reactors are very efficient, very safe, very stable, and they will work in the dark.

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.100
They will work in the light.

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:53.280
And they, what's interesting about a reactor design like that is they're about 25% efficient

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:59.240
in the sense that the, with a Sterling engine, they would make maybe a hundred kilowatts of

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:05.640
electricity, but also 400 kilowatts of heat, right?

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.060
They're always ready.

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:06.760
And it's probably cold.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:07.820
You probably want a heater up there.

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:08.240
You're right.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.440
And, oh, you wanted to melt some ice too, didn't you?

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.160
Right.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:12.440
Gee.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:18.960
So here's this device that produces two things you need a lot of and is particularly safe in

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.500
a vacuum.

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:24.140
So maturing those technologies, I'm saying maturing because largely they're developed.

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.340
You know, they've been proven to work.

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:32.260
They just have to scale them and mature them and then lift them would be the turning point

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:37.140
for really building a long, sustainable base and being able to do that kind of mining and

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:42.300
extraction and learning that would get us to a place where we would have continuous habitation

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:42.760
on the moon.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:49.460
We've had humans in orbit around the earth, three to six of them now, for more than 20 years.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.340
It's a milestone in civilization.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:51.680
Yeah.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.660
It absolutely is.

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:54.100
That's incredible.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:59.320
In our lifetime, we're going to have two to four people continuously inhabiting the moon.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.700
We're going to change them out because they'll go a little crazy.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:06.060
But, you know, every few months, a different group will go up there and the moon will become

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.000
like Antarctica.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.300
It'll be a place mostly for scientists, mostly for science.

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:11.680
Right.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.040
Do a six-month stint on it when you come back.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:14.160
Yeah.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.180
Maybe shorter, right?

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:16.480
We deal with radiation concerns.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.400
I think they're talking about 45 to 60 days.

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:21.220
And then you'll come back.

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.760
So, steady rotation is going on there.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.120
But, you know, there is a little bit of tourism these days to Antarctica.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.120
If you want to spend the money, if you're looking for the adventure of a lifetime, you can go

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:32.600
to Antarctica.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.240
The moon will get there.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.520
You get those first bases up there.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.060
You get some operations in place.

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.820
Sooner or later, the tourists will come.

01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:41.100
Yeah.

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:41.860
They definitely will.

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:46.180
If they're willing to go pay a ton to just go float around in the space station or go

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:46.880
low Earth orbit.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.140
Yes.

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:48.180
That's a whole other level.

01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:48.480
Yeah.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.120
This is just the next step after that.

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:55.060
You know, the Richard Garriots of the world who have that kind of money, of course they want

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:55.240
to go.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:55.440
Yeah.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.420
Absolutely.

01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:02.040
Well, Richard, this is a really interesting view of this whole thing going on with the

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:02.420
moon base.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.400
I really hope it happens.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:09.660
I think it would be great just for the inspiration that it brings, you know, not even the science

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:10.160
necessarily.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.960
I've left out a part of this conversation that is significant, but I prefer, I hope it's

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.380
not true.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:23.240
I hope that it's that small increase in budget, the 0.48 to 0.72 is enough that Congress sees

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:23.900
their way forward.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.420
But if America doesn't do it, the Chinese will.

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:26.680
Yeah.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.520
You know, the Chinese space program is no fooling.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:29.560
They're pushing hard.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.760
They currently have a capability that America doesn't have.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:38.640
They have a satellite sitting in the Lagrange point two on the far side of the moon that allows

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.560
them to communicate with their rover on the far side of the moon.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.440
The America can't do that.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.980
They have not put that satellite up.

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.080
They could, but they haven't.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:52.500
And so, you know, China is actually well placed if they want to push to establish a base on the

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.040
moon as well.

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.620
And I guess it's a question of whether that is an incentive.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:01.040
I hope it's not the incentive, but it could be the incentive for continuing to drive this

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:01.280
forward.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:01.540
Yeah.

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:06.140
Well, it's a little bit of a history repeating itself, maybe a little bit.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.420
Well, super interesting.

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:14.400
One thing I do want to just throw out at the end of this conversation is this album by this,

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.800
I guess you call them a band.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:20.320
They definitely make music and it's very good, called Public Service Broadcasting.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.780
Are you familiar with this, Richard?

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.080
I am.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:22.380
Yeah.

01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:26.920
So they've created an album called The Race for Space, and it's a musical album.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:34.980
Like a lot of the undercurrents, what would be kind of almost the baseline is the actual radio

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:38.160
communication from the Apollo Race for Space.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.960
And it's super interesting.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:47.060
It's really a cool way to have sort of music plus this history plus just this whole space

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:47.680
thing going.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.520
So check that out.

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.480
I'll link to it in the show notes.

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:49.860
Love it.

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:50.060
Yeah.

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:50.600
It's cool, right?

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:50.840
Yeah.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.880
Well, and it also reminds us that one of the side effects of NASA and the way they were set

01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:01.480
up is that absolutely everything that they make, they make available to the public, to the

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.700
world public, not just Americans, right?

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:07.940
Every image that the Lunar Conscious Orbiter takes is published.

01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:13.200
In fact, it was an Indian software programmer that found the Vikram Lander remains.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.160
He looked for it through the LRO objects.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.460
He plowed the public publications.

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:20.080
NASA didn't find it.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:20.860
He found it first.

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:25.260
They agreed that he found it, but he actually was the one who searched their data.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:30.160
The reason we have all those audio recordings of all the Apollo stuff is that it was published

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.780
within 24 hours of it being recorded.

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:32.140
Wow.

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:32.560
That's cool.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.420
It always has been.

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.660
And it's public domain.

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.080
You can do with it what you will.

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:39.240
They don't protect the logo of NASA or any of those things.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.120
It's part of it being a quote unquote public service.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:47.680
Same time when the Chinese found something unusual in a crater on the far side of the moon,

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.020
they didn't release it.

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.700
They just said they found something unusual.

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:56.040
When the Indian, the ISRU, realized their Vikram Lander was lost, they didn't publish the

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:56.760
pictures they found.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.640
NASA did.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.040
I think we take it for granted.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:15:59.700
We've forgotten.

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.220
NASA publishes absolutely everything.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:07.400
Every piece of data they've collected from every spacecraft ever is available in public

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:07.600
art.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.420
That's a really great service, actually.

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:09.820
Yeah.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.680
And it's not necessary, but it is.

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.360
It is true.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.480
Like, we wonder if we're the good guys sometimes.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.520
You know what I mean?

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:18.820
Like, this is a tough time in society where we're trying to figure out what's important,

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:19.300
what isn't.

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:25.740
We do this thing where we give away some of the most advanced science ever made.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.180
And we always have.

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:29.840
And we just forget how important that actually is.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:34.320
And now that there's others keeping secrets about that same kind of information, and NASA

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.220
continues to share it.

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:41.400
Let's not forget that being honest and being public and being visible to everything you

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.880
do is actually part of being in constructive society.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.220
Yeah.

01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:46.220
That's a great point.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:50.580
And it's definitely more obvious in the contrast to the other ones.

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:50.800
Yeah.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.240
It's more visible now than it's ever been.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:52.540
Yep.

01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:53.500
All right.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:58.060
Well, before we call it a show, I want to just give you a quick chance to just tell the

01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:00.020
folks about this book that you're working on.

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.040
It's really interesting.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.880
And this is a book around the .NET space.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:07.440
I would love to see the equivalent book written for the Python space.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:10.740
And I don't have the time or ability to do it myself.

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:13.200
But tell folks real quick about this project you're working on.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.060
It's almost out, right?

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.140
Almost is a great phrase.

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.800
It's been almost for five how many years?

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:19.060
Yeah.

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.300
It's been a couple of years.

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:20.600
You can drag it on.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:26.260
It's been a couple of years of doing research on to the origins and sort of the story of .NET.

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:29.480
You know, .NET went through a pretty dark time a few years ago.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:36.040
And as Microsoft sort of turned the corner and focused on cloud and de-emphasized Windows

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:41.880
and cared more about open source, .NET's kind of hip again, you know, doing well.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.700
Number of users going up and people enjoying C# and using it in different ways is growing.

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:51.580
And so it seemed like a good time to sort of take a look back and see where we came from.

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:55.420
And I've got about 100 hours of interviews done now.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:18:02.580
And I'm assembling this narrative of the role that .NET played in changing Microsoft.

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:08.600
You know, it was a tool that was built to facilitate the building of software by enterprise developers

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.540
working on Windows.

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:10.760
That's its origin.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:15.180
And then along the way, you know, Windows had some serious issues.

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.500
And .NET was sometimes blamed for that.

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:21.740
And it finally hit a point where there was a realization that Microsoft wasn't about Windows.

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.360
That Microsoft was actually about cloud.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.760
And that .NET could help facilitate its move to the cloud.

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:34.540
And this combination of open source and .NET have been one of the leaders of making Microsoft

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.460
into a cloud company.

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:40.960
And the story that I'm finding as I study the history of .NET is that it's part of the transformation

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:41.900
of the company.

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:45.080
Folks are asking me, like, why is Microsoft suddenly a hip place again?

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:45.860
They were IBM.

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:48.540
They were the fuddy-duddy technology company.

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:49.440
Now they're kind of cool.

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.540
Like, what happened?

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.760
And they completely changed.

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:53.900
They transformed themselves.

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:55.500
And .NET was part of that transformation.

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.120
Oh, that's cool.

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:59.500
I think the book will tell an interesting slice of the tech history.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:05.120
And, you know, Python's going through a lot of changes now with retirement, official,

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.420
actually, obsolescence of Python.

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:12.360
And it might be time for an interesting look back as well in that space.

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.000
I think it would be.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.700
But again, I wish I had time to do it.

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:15.260
All right.

01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:17.200
Well, final quick question before you add it.

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:19.520
If you're going to write some code, what editor do you use these days?

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.240
VS Code.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.500
If I'm not working strictly in .NET, I mean, Studio is always on my machine.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:27.160
You know, I dabble in Python every so often.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:30.540
And writing Python and VS Code is very pleasant.

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:30.840
Yeah.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:37.280
Does it surprise you that the Python extension for VS Code is, by a factor of at least two,

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:42.100
the most popular extension over C#, over C++, over JavaScript, all the other things?

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:46.260
What that says to me is people are frustrated with other editors working in Python.

01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:49.380
You know, that they need a better choice.

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.440
But I'm glad that that's true.

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:57.440
These new tools they've been making were not just for the incumbent users of Microsoft technology.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.940
They're for everyone.

01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:01.960
And you're seeing a larger group of people starting to embrace them.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.200
Yeah.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:02.720
Super cool.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.680
It's definitely a good one.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.460
All right.

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:05.560
Final call to action.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:12.500
People are excited about this episode's topic, the moon base, or probably more generally,

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.460
I think they should check out the Geek Out shows.

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.040
What do they do?

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:21.800
Geek Out.show is the shortcut URL that'll take you to a filtered list of the 80 or so Geek

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.540
Outs that exist.

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:26.900
While I'm head down on the book, I have not been making as many Geek Outs.

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:28.100
I put them out once in a while.

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:29.060
They are a lot of work.

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:33.720
But we've also covered some fairly big chunks of data now.

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:37.620
So I'm wondering if some of those subjects need to be revisited, like a lot of the alternative

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:38.180
energy things.

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:39.620
You know, solar's evolved.

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.440
Wind's evolved.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:44.340
So I'd love folks to go and poke on those shows that are a few years old now and tell

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:48.840
me, hey, you know, you've missed out on X or these things have changed and maybe get

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.160
me jazzed to do an update.

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.680
There's so much exciting news about those.

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.380
And I really enjoyed listening to these.

01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:58.200
They're very similar to what we talked about on this show, right?

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.280
The core part of it in the middle, at least.

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:03.740
So if that was interesting to you, check out these shows because I think you've done a

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:06.320
lot of great work and I'm happy to share them with everyone.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.580
I'm sure people will enjoy it.

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:08.040
Thank you, Michael.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:08.540
You're welcome.

01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:09.400
And thanks for being on the show.

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:09.860
My pleasure.

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:10.140
Bye.

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:14.080
This has been another episode of Talk Python to Me.

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.580
Our guest on this episode was Richard Campbell, and it's been brought to you by Clubhouse and

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:18.940

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.500
teams together to ship value, not features.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.220

Or if you're looking for something more advanced, check out our new async course that digs into

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.520
all the different types of async programming you can do in Python.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.460
And of course, if you're interested in more than one of these, be sure to check out our

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.900
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.400
Thanks so much for listening.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.440
I really appreciate it.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.220
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:26.820
Thank you.

01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:34.620

Thank you.
