00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.680
Have you ever wondered what a developer advocate, sometimes called a developer evangelist, does?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.380
You know the folks. They're often seen at conferences, working at some high-end tech

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.620
company's booth, or traveling from conference to conference speaking on their specialty.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.460
Who are these folks? How did they get this job, and what is it really like to do it from day to

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.600
day? Join me, along with Cecil Phillip from Microsoft, Matt McKay from Twilio, and Paul

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.560
Everett from JetBrains to dig into what it means to be a developer advocate and how they each became

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.880
one for such cool tech companies. This is Talk Python To Me, episode 189, recorded November 28th, 2018.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:54.420
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.100
and the personalities. This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Twitter, where I'm at,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.320
Twitter via at Talk Python. Cecil, Paul, Matt, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.020
Thanks for having us.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.020
Yeah, it's great to have you all here. I'm super excited about this, I'm not even sure what we're

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.580
calling it, developer advocate, developer evangelist, developer relations conversation, because I feel

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.480
like this role is a little bit mysterious to many folks in the software engineering field.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.840
But at the same time, it looks really fun. And I think a lot of folks interact with all of you,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.340
and it's going to be really fun to just dig into what you do and how you got there.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.960
So I guess the first place to start will be, where do you work for who you are? A little more background,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.440
who you are, where you work, and what you do there in terms of this advocacy role.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.700
Cecil, let's start with you.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.100
Sure, no problem. So my name is Cecil Fulop. Right now, I'm a developer advocate at Microsoft.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.480
Primarily, my team focuses a lot on just making sure developers have a really good experience moving their

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.820
applications into the cloud. So as you can imagine, we work a lot with the folks on the Azure side of things,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.580
but then also, too, we spend a lot of time in the community kind of just going around to various events and doing

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.380
workshops and different things like that.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.480
All right, excellent. Paul, I'm a developer advocate, using the word advocate.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.540
We'll get back to that later. JetBrains, primarily for PyCharm, and I'm based out of the U.S.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.440
I get to tell people I work for a check company founded by Russians out of my basement in Virginia for the Boston office.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:41.840
And many of them are in Germany. So yeah, it's quite the international space. And in terms of developer focus, that's basically all you guys do, which is pretty awesome. So you'll have a lot of tools to talk about there. Matt, how about yourself?

00:02:41.940 --> 00:03:04.560
Yeah, so I work in developer relations for Twilio. And I actually been with Twilio for about five years, used to be just an evangelist. Then I was helping to basically serving the evangelism team, leading the evangelism team. And now I run a peer team of the evangelism team, which focuses on helping developers get their code and their stories published on Twilio.com.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.540
So does that make you like a meta evangelist?

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:17.620
Well, I still do. I still do a lot of evangelism, but it's more focused on the online activities of getting developers to basically promoting developers who built really cool things with Twilio.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:28.040
Yeah. And I guess it's also worth throwing out that other folks may also know some of you from your online stuff. Like Matt, you do full stack Python, which is super popular and well known. That's awesome.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.440
Thanks.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.760
Yeah. And Cecil, you're away from the keyboard podcast is excellent as well. People might know you from there.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.500
Sure. Thank you.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:53.080
Yeah, sure. So I guess the first thing is, you know, when you go to college or where you teach yourself programming, there's a big gap between I can now write a program and I'm now representing Azure, JetBrains, Twilio in sort of a public speaking semi marketing thing.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:08.180
But you still, you know, I know all three of your programming work and you're all excellent programmers. So there's this deep technical side, but there's also this capability that many people in the software field don't embrace too much like the public speaking and marketing side.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.640
So the story of how you got there, I think it's really interesting. Maybe we'll go in reverse. Matt, how did you go along that path?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:30.980
Yeah. So I I've been programming since I was a kid and then I became full time programmer. I became a tech lead. So I was doing really heads down coding for about eight years. And then I wanted to get out of my own bubble. I live in Washington, D.C. and get out of the tech scene here and kind of explore elsewhere.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:53.200
So I did a road trip around the country for five months to 30 different cities and just like send emails to developers and was like, hey, like, what's it like being a software developer in Memphis? Like, what's it like being a software developer? Obviously, San Francisco, Chicago, all places around the country. And then I met a bunch of folks from Twilio. And after I was done with my project, my road trip, they asked me if I was willing to join the company.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:05.940
So for me, it was a little bit of getting out of my comfort zone. I still code every single day, but it was sort of stepping out outside of my typical boundaries and then expanding my skill set beyond just programming.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.620
Man, that sounds like such a cool trip.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.200
Yeah, you can actually see the pictures. It's codingacrossamerica.com. I still have the website up.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.640
Really?

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.400
I haven't updated it. Yeah, codingacrossamerica.com.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.380
Oh, right on. That's awesome. Paul, how about you? Did you do like a world tour or how do you do it?

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.900
No, I sat in my basement.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:29.200
But the internet, the traffic, the commute to the basement is way, way nicer. That's for sure.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.840
Yeah, so tell us about it.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:41.440
Sure. I like to joke at Python conferences. I'm not the oldest person you know, but the company that was a Python startup, I was in the Navy in 1994.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.760
And I wanted a boss. I wanted to be on a team. I wanted to work for something I believe.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.740
And then I got really lucky to get a job offer from JetBrains.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:58.580
And to come back to your lead-in point about what's being asked for, when I was offered the job, my boss, Hadi Hariri, you know really well, Mike.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.580
Yeah, I've known Hadi for a long time. He's a great guy.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.980
Fantastic guy.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.660
Yeah.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.960
Yeah.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:14.060
He said something, and I wonder if Cecil and Matt had the same experience, but he said, it's important for you to be part of the community and be perceived as part of the community.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.900
And when you do things, you need to do it as you, not us.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.940
And I thought at the time, that's just BS that you say, but you don't actually believe.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.200
But I joined the company, and that's actually the way the job works.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.160
You're expected to be respected as a community person first.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:38.760
I think that's a great point, and I think it's really interesting that there is this little bit of cult of personality aspect to this job role.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.740
Like many of the folks that I know in this field, they're semi-well-known, if not really well-known, on their own.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.360
And I think the companies see that as an advantage.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:57.500
Like, we're going to have this person who is really well-known or respected in the community, and their halo will shine off on our company a little bit.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.840
Indeed, and that's kind of a dark side to that because it implies that we as the company don't have enough reputation.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.740
We've got to ride the coattails of this person who will then become a mouthpiece for our message.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.680
And that is thinking backwards along several axes.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.660
Yeah, sure.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.240
Cecil, how did you get to where you are?

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:26.060
You work for a company about 2,500 miles away from where you live, so it's not just down the street either, which I think is a pretty common trait of this role, right?

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.800
Yeah, definitely.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.220
Most of my teammates, probably not all of them, or everybody's all remote, right?

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.540
So everybody's at some different part of the world, which, as you can imagine, makes meetings a little bit challenging sometimes.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.980
You get really good with figuring out time zones, right?

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:46.620
Yeah, exercising, scheduling, calendars for time zones is an exercise in itself.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.100
That definitely takes a lot of time.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.660
But for me, I want to say, you know, so I've been in the South Florida community probably ever since I left college.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:08:01.620
And at some point, I decided that, you know, I kind of wanted to reach out a little bit more and get a little bit more than what I was getting inside of the office.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.940
So, you know, I started to go to user group meetings, and I started to go to these CodeCamp things.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:11.960
You know, CodeCamps are like these free technology, kind of like conferences, but not really, like smaller conferences.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.960
And, you know, I started to go to these things because, you know, I kind of wanted to just be around the community and learn a little bit more than what I was getting.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:24.260
And at some point, some person decided, hey, you know, you've got some interesting stuff to talk about.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.060
Why don't you come up and give a presentation?

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.840
I was like, nah, nobody wants to hear what I have to talk about.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.760
Like, why in the world would I ever want to do that?

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.260
So after some continuous poking, like eventually I, you know, I accepted it.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.020
I started speaking.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.420
And, you know, I just, I got a little bit addicted to it.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.620
Like, I kept doing it more, and I went to more conferences and whatnot.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.640
And, you know, that led to a lot of interesting opportunities.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.220
You know, I became a teacher at Miami Dade College for a little bit.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.500
I talked there for about three years.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:58.040
But, you know, I've always had that, you know, wanting to go out and, you know, talk to people and kind of listen to their problems

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.740
and really just understand what they've been doing.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:06.000
And honestly, randomly, one day I saw a message on Twitter and it said, hey, we're building this really cool team at Microsoft.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.260
And I was like, eh, whatever.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.060
I'm not doing anything.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.720
I'll just reply to this tweet, right?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.860
Because, of course, people get tired like that all the time.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.680
And I got a reply back in a couple interviews later and some formal conversations later.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:18.960
Yeah.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.740
That's awesome.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.600
You know, that really mirrors my path.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:29.060
I mean, I didn't go down the dev relations side of things, but I sort of wanted to branch out from where I was.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.560
I felt like there wasn't enough growth in what I was doing.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:37.700
You know, I felt like, oh, I kind of know at least as much as everyone in the field and the company that I'm working at.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.760
And how do I how do I get better?

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:39.980
Right.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.580
So I started going to user groups and doing speaking.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:48.200
And a developmenter actually came to me and said, hey, if you're going to do this for free, we'll pay you to do this if this is the thing you want to do.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.380
So I said, actually, that's a pretty cool idea.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:50.800
I'll do that.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:58.000
So, yeah, I think I think it's really interesting how these little steps lead down these paths that you don't necessarily expect.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.720
And it also sounds to me like all three of you sort of had that feeling of I'd like to kind of branch out from from where I am for something bigger.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.680
Right.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.060
And it kind of led those little steps down that path led to these roles.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.320
Right.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:11.980
Yeah.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:18.480
You know, when I spoke to my first manager, he always said, you know, I actually asked him, what do I need to do to prepare for this job?

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.840
And he looked at me and he's like, you've been preparing for this job like all your career.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.520
Right.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.000
Which is kind of interesting when you think about it.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.160
Right.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:33.740
Because as a as somebody that's coming out and just starting into the workforce, you never think, oh, OK, this is what I want to do.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:41.940
It's not like your typical career path, I guess, like if you do computer science or if you decide you want to pick up and learn a programming language or web pages or something.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.320
But so I think it's something that's very like just a part of who you are as a person.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:47.560
Right.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.820
Like, do you like talking to people?

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.060
Do you like, you know, engaging with folks?

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.340
Do you like helping people learn and succeed?

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:53.700
Right.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.600
And again, if it's something that you want to do, again, it's just kind of a part of your your DNA as a person.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:58.880
Right.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.160
Like, it's kind of hard to teach those types of things.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.680
Yes.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:09.460
It's funny to me because the side that a lot of people see of evangelists or advocates is speaking on stage or reading a blog post.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:16.820
But what it really comes down to for me and what I feel like the best evangelists do, they really just want to help other people, help other developers.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.500
They retain that sense of curiosity and learning like any programmer, any great programmer.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.500
But they really want to help other programmers become better.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:32.020
And to me, that's like the crux of the job is just like, hey, how do I help other developers at scale?

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.660
That's that's what I get really excited about.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:40.200
Yeah, I'll add to both of what I think Matt and Cecil got really to the heart of it, that, yeah, you see the rock star thing.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:50.600
But the prime directive is the human side and the deep empathy for people and the desire to measure your success by making other people better.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.520
That book, Badass, Making Users Awesome, really gets to that point.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.840
And if you're not wired that way as a human being, then you're not going to be good in this role.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:14.520
Would you say that if you're the type of person who really gets a lot of satisfaction of sitting down next to, say, a junior teammate or somebody and like showing them how to start working with an ORM or do something that they haven't done before?

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:21.240
Does that kind of experience and desire sort of map well to this like more professional version?

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:21.980
Yeah, definitely.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:28.320
And you have to have the humility to say this person I'm sitting next to or this person I'm having a conversation with via email.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.080
Like they may not know as much in this area.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.180
And, you know, I'm just going to help them work through the problem as best as possible.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:42.860
And just having the humility to – because we've all been – we've all worked with developers who kind of dismiss your questions.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.940
You can't do that.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:49.400
You really have to have empathy for other people and have humility for what your own skills and other people's skills are.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.940
Yeah, you've got to still feel the pain of learning it, you know, five or ten years ago yourself or maybe not so long ago.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:01.680
So I guess one of the things that would be interesting would be sort of talking about what is – what does your job actually look like?

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.560
I mean you have to stay on top of all these technologies, you know, especially you, Cecil.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.700
Like I feel like Azure has got like a whole new thing every day or something.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.080
And you're just like, wait, what is this?

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.460
The old thing is new or the new thing is now old.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.140
This new new thing is the thing.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.180
So how much of this is like studying, learning, personal research?

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.420
How much is travel?

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.640
How much is public speaking?

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.300
And what else is there to it?

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.240
I want to say in our particular organization, it really depends, right?

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.780
I like to tell people it's kind of like a choose-your-own-adventure type role, at least the way that we kind of approach it.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:39.800
So a big part of what we do is, you know, we spend a lot of time with the engineering teams.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:47.320
You know, when updates are happening, when new products are coming out, when, you know, tutorials and documentation and like when things are being created, right?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.340
So we can tell the good story.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:54.840
And so a lot of the times, you know, we've been – you'll probably be working with some of these tools or these SDKs before some folks have seen them.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.340
You know, because, you know, part of the role is, again, it's not just traveling or, you know, being on videos and stuff like that.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.200
But, you know, we have to provide constructive feedback.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.560
You know, do people like these things that we're building for you?

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.140
And, you know, is this useful?

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.220
Are we recovering your use cases?

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:09.900
You know what I mean?

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:16.880
Like, is this a thing that's going to make it easier for you to build, you know, applications and solutions on top of the platform that we're trying to provide for you?

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:27.080
And so, you know, what you find is a lot of our teammates, you know, again, other than just, sure, the traveling and all that other stuff, but we try and align ourselves with products that we just generally care about.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:33.440
So, you know, like, I spend a lot of time with the Azure Functions team because, you know, I'm really interested in learning about serverless.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.300
Or, you know, the Service Plus team because, you know, I want to learn about messaging and A or QP, right?

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.160
Because, again, Azure in itself has like 100 and change products, right?

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.700
Maybe even 200 products, right?

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.440
And, you know, each one of them has their own sets of buttons to press and knobs to turn and all that stuff.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.400
And no one person is going to know all of it or even half of them.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:15:13.100
But, again, like, if you generally care and are passionate about something and you want to see this product succeed or, you know, you want to really understand how this stuff works because your audience that you're focusing on cares about these things, then, you know, you can make the time to sit down and focus on it, read the documentation, create samples about it so you can have like a genuine understanding of, well, this is kind of how this stuff works.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.060
And here are the pain points are.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.960
And here's how we can make this better for our communities.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.980
That's really interesting.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:31.740
So it sounds to me like almost you're the first user or consumer of the thing the engineering team is creating in some sense because you're trying to learn it as they're creating it and you're giving them feedback like, whoa, guys, this API is wonky.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.180
People aren't going to love it.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.260
Is that accurate?

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.380
Yeah, that happens in most cases, right?

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:41.340
Most cases, you know, we get to play around with things or see some feedback or slide decks or whatever the case is.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:47.060
So we can then, again, make some, you know, make some recommendations or, you know, do some reviews on things.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.060
Because, again, like, you know, we know our community better than everybody else does, right?

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.200
Because we're out in the field and we're talking to them and we're interacting with them.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.940
Again, most advocates come from a community, right?

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.700
Like that's, you know, that's kind of how it is.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:06.960
And so, you know, with that context, we can look at these products objectively and say, well, you know, I really don't think .NET developers are going to like this thing.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.260
I really don't think JavaScript folks are going to like that thing.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.700
Because you know how they work.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.940
You know what the tool sets are.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.640
You know, you know, how I like my environment set up.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:21.160
And so based on that, you can give some useful feedback to the product team so that, you know, they can focus on building and solving the right problems.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.580
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.680
And, of course, there's going to the conferences and sort of organizing that stuff as well, right?

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.540
Being at the booth maybe?

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.880
Yeah, booth is interesting.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.480
You know, we got a lot of good questions when you're at the booth, right?

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:44.100
Because, you know, a lot of the times when you're after you've given a talk and after you've done a workshop or whatever the case is, you know, not everybody is as, you know, not everybody's going to come up and talk to you, right?

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.800
Like they probably do have questions and they do have things that they want to ask.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.340
And so, you know, sometimes it's kind of good to just kind of hang around and linger a little bit.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.140
So whether that's at the booth or sometimes just even on the hallway, right?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.860
Like it's the same kind of thing a little bit.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:01.980
Just try to make yourself accessible to these people so that they can know, hey, well, you know, he's not so busy now.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:07.340
Like maybe I could go and talk to him and ask him a question because, you know, you might not always be like available to do that.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.080
Yeah, sure.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.920
Paul, what's it look like from the JetBrains side in terms of the stuff that you do?

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.660
What's your balance there?

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.400
Cecil said so many good things.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.160
I'll kind of zero in on the last part about the booth.

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:30.160
And traditionally, back when I was a kid with Moses and all those people at the booth, it would be salespeople or engineers.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.920
Neither of which are the ideal target for someone in the community to come up and engage with.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.200
Yeah.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:36.760
Yeah.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.880
So you need a hybrid.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.240
And I think that's us.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:45.060
And the word developer advocate, the phrase developer advocate is the advocate for the developers.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:50.900
And that's another part that Cecil said that I thought was pretty good, which was the choose your own adventure.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:56.100
And the things that he feels passionate about and the serverless and the function stuff.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:08.580
When he digs in on it and he has the developer experience, he can be the missing chair at the table internally as the voice of the community, as the consumer of this stuff.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:20.160
And instead of being a case where the company just transmits a message to the recipients, the developer advocate is a way for the recipients to transmit a message back to the company.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.520
I see.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.520
So you're like a web socket.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:21.760
Yeah.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.180
In fact, I think that's a really important role.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.080
What I was actually thinking was more like an elected representative, right?

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.300
Like you're sort of almost.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.660
Or an ombud for the newspaper.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.440
Yes.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:31.760
Yeah.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:31.940
Yeah.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:32.260
Sort of.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:38.260
You're almost a representative for the community back to the company as much as you are for the company to the people.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:38.740
Indeed.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.640
Indeed.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:39.720
Yeah.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:46.800
And so in order to be a trusted outlet for the community, you got to be in the community.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.220
Yeah.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:55.920
And like Cecil said, you got to be seen as participating and having the mojo on the thing that you're speaking for.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.200
Yeah.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.500
The developer community is pretty good at finding out people who are clearly imposters.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.940
And I'm not talking imposter syndrome.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.460
I don't feel like I'm good enough to do that.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.880
I mean, people who are like actually not skilled or not interested, right?

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.420
That comes out pretty quick.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:09.600
Yeah.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.080
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Linode.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.800

That's L-I-N-O-D-E.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.220
Plans start at just $5 a month for a dedicated server with a gig of RAM.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.440
They have 10 data centers across the globe.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.260
So no matter where you are or where your users are, there's a data center for you.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.320
Need a little help with your infrastructure?

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.040
They even offer professional services to help you with architecture, migrations, and more.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.000
Do you want a dedicated server for free for the next four months?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.060
Just visit talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:11.740
So in terms of speaking, working with engineering teams, travel, conferences, all that, what's your breakdown look like?

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:17.680
One-third serving the product team, one-third conferences, one-third advocate.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.280
Right on.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.380
And then the advocate is...

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:20.800
Sorry, go ahead.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:27.820
I spent a lot of time maintaining the Twitter and Facebook for PyCharm.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:33.920
And that's an interesting point, kind of getting back to what we were talking about, Matt was also talking about earlier, about the motivators.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.240
That is quite a spotlight.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.840
The Twitter account for PyCharm.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.700
Yeah.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:45.180
And if somebody does something cool out there, and boy, Michael, you are great at this.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:45.520
Thank you.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.300
At giving love to other people.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.200
And showing respect to them.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.820
And then you probably have them on cloud nine for the whole week.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.140
Wow.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.000
Talk Python noticed me.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:55.920
It's an important part.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.660
There's people doing amazing stuff.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.940
And if you notice it and you respect it, that creates a real bond.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:10.720
And sure, from a Machiavellian perspective, the company is giving them love so that they become an advocate for the product, blah, blah, blah.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.120
But just from a human perspective, it feels a lot better to show respect to people.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.680
Matt, what's your world look like?

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:23.940
Yeah, so I think there's two large areas that seem very nebulous to developers when we talk about developer relations.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.180
The first is kind of the tactical day in and day out.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.040
How much do you travel?

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.380
How much time do you have for coding?

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.000
I actually have a landing page.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.160
It's at devangel.io.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.400
And that is a roll-up of different blog posts that developer evangelists, developer advocates have written about.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.000
Like, here's what my day looks like.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.840
Here's what my responsibilities look like.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.600
So I have a whole...

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.260
That is awesome.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.800
Yeah, there's a bunch of posts that are out there.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.240
So you can get kind of a wide range of like here.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.500
And I even have some of my own posts.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.220
Like, here's how I spend my day as a developer evangelist.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.020
So that's kind of like one sort of nebulous reason, nebulous area.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.880
It's like, what tactically does the role look like?

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:10.400
And then there's the second area, which is like, what's the difference between a developer evangelist, developer advocate, developer relations?

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.940
There's all these titles floating around.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:17.060
And to be fair, part of it is actually confusion.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.180
In a lot of cases, the titles aren't necessarily put out there with a lot of thought behind them by some companies.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:29.620
But the way that we view it at Twilio is developer evangelists are called evangelists because they go to where developers are.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:35.540
So, for example, like we go to PyCon, the PyCons around the world, because that's where Python developers are.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.640
And we are showing them how to build Twilio, helping them use Twilio.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:47.280
A developer advocate sort of has a different function, which I think the other guys have talked about, which is they're bringing feedback into the company.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.680
So the evangelists are bringing some feedback in, but I would say it's like 10 to 20 percent of their job.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.920
Whereas when you're a developer advocate, it's like actually tends to be like 50 percent or more.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:05.860
You're bringing feedback in from developers in the community and saying to the product teams like, hey, I think we actually need to change like, you know, the way that this API is structured or something like that.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.200
And so I think those are kind of like the two large areas that people often have questions.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.180
And so at least at Twilio, when I joined five years ago, we only had developer evangelists.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:23.880
And then from there, we branched out into a developer education team, which works on the docs and what's called Twilio Quest, our training platform, 8-bit adventure training platform.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.820
We have a developer community team, which sets up events just for Twilio developers.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:37.420
And then a team called Developer Voices, which helps to shine the spotlight, as you were just talking about, the big power of shining the spotlight on developers who built something really cool.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.280
Because so many developers were coming to us and saying, I built this awesome thing with Twilio.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.860
Like, how do I show it to more people?

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.980
And we're like, actually, maybe this is something that we should do more often.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.220
That's a really great distinction.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.420
I hadn't really thought about the different titles, but you really explained it well.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:24:06.520
So I guess one of the things that people who maybe are considering a role like this, because it sounds more fun than closing Jare tickets in a cube farm, for example, we can talk about some of the drawbacks as well, but is maybe how much travel is involved.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.820
So just I go around really quick.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.720
Like, if on any given month, how many days of a month would you say you're gone, Cecil?

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.480
On a busy month, I'd probably say eight days.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.140
So eight days being like, I'd probably travel two, I'll do like two trips for that month.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.020
Yeah, that's not too bad.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:21.600
Paul?

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.140
I'd say the average on our team matches what Cecil said.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:32.400
I have a different situation with an elderly father who lives with us, and so I'm not going to be traveling as much as other people do.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:42.280
But I'd say that if you're going beyond eight, you're on your way to burnout, and you're also not serving the longer term goal.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:42.620
Right.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:49.220
I think it's also there's a difference between eight one-day trips and two or one four eight-day trips, right?

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:58.160
Like, the airtime and the being in the travel action versus being in a different location are also – there's more wear and tear on the eight one-day trips.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.260
Matt?

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.980
So in my current role on my team, I run a remote team.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.100
We generally only travel roughly once a month for internal meetings.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.020
But as the evangelist team does travel significantly, but it's all seasonal.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.980
I mean, you know, when there's a lot of conferences going on, that's when you tend to be on the road a lot.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:23.540
And then, you know, holidays during the summer, people tend to be able to hang out and write some code and not get on an airplane.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:29.940
So it really, I think, depends on your ecosystem, which programming language you're working in, and kind of what your yearly schedule looks like.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:37.700
You really are at the mercy, to some extent, of the community as opposed to always setting your own schedule ahead of time.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.600
Yeah, like for Cecil, it would be really hard for you to say, I'm going to skip build this year.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.200
Yeah, I definitely couldn't do that.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:50.860
So I'd say any of the first-party events, like we generally have like a strong force of people there.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.720
But then, you know, anything that's third-party, that is kind of up in the air, right?

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.220
Like, is this an important conference to go to?

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.240
And when I say important, it's, should we have a good presence there?

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.980
Like, you know, are we going to go and, you know, do we have good big announcements to make?

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.380
Or, you know, is there a community there that we're not really serving that we should really pay attention to?

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:14.800
You know, like some of those types of things we look at and, you know, we determine, hey, well, we really need to send some manpower here.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.520
Or, you know, hey, well, you know, these folks have a lot of .NET developers ready.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.480
Maybe we don't need to, like, do that as much, right?

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:27.920
Like, maybe we should spend that time looking at more underrepresented communities and underrepresented focus areas, you know?

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.860
Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.680
That makes a lot of sense.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.500
I guess one thing that would be interesting to consider is which companies are out there that are doing a good job now.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:43.520
Like, what companies would you hold up as being, doing this advocacy or evangelist role well?

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.340
I mean, I certainly think Microsoft, JetBrains, and Twilio are all in these categories with each of the three of you.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.640
But what else?

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.880
Seems like Google's doing pretty well.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.720
Seems like there's a lot of folks there.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.220
Google does do really well.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:27:00.100
And actually, Hugh, I was on their YouTube channel just yesterday, actually.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:04.840
You know, if they can't look at their YouTube channel, they have a lot of interesting shows that a lot of their evangelists do.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.920
And just talking about product updates and what's coming out.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.320
And Flutter is a big thing.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.300
They've been talking about that.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.160
Google App Engine, things like that.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.720
So I definitely pay attention to what they're doing there in that space.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.200
Yeah, they have kind of a cool interview video channel.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.740
It's almost like a TV channel that you can stream or is also on YouTube.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.080
Like, I saw Kelsey Hightower interviewed there, and he did a great job.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:31.260
You know, that made me realize, Cecil, that I totally overlooked all of your Channel 9 work.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:37.720
And Channel 9 is actually one of these interesting creations that came out of the whole dev evangelist advocate side of things.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.300
You maybe want to just talk a little bit about that and maybe what you're up to there?

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.760
Sure, I can talk about that for a little bit.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:52.820
So Channel 9, and that's channel9.msdn.com, is Microsoft's developer portal for video content.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:58.900
So, you know, it dates back, I don't know, maybe at least 10, 15 years.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.280
I don't know.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.320
Like, it's way longer than I've been at the company.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:06.240
But essentially what we have is a collection of, you know, curated shows around, like, various different topics.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.160
We have stuff, again, that's on .NET, stuff that's on Azure.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.200
You know, we have an open source show that's really popular now.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.940
So we talk a lot about, you know, things like Kubernetes and Kafka and, you know, some of those types of technology.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.120
It's almost like CNN for developers, right?

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.560
You've got sort of those panels and you're talking, there's a screen.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.260
It's pretty produced, pretty well produced.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.200
It's pretty well produced.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:32.140
And, you know, one of the things that we used to do a lot that I think we're going to try and get back into is doing some more of that, like, personal touch videos.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:40.480
We used to do a lot of videos where we actually just walked into people's offices or we'd walk the hallways of the company and just pop in and be like, hey, what are you doing, right?

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.620
And then it ends up into, like, a whiteboard discussion.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.540
Obviously, we'll tell you that we're coming, right?

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:52.000
But, you know, it ends up into a whiteboard discussion of, hey, well, this is the beta of this or the alpha of that or here's some of the things that we're thinking about.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.040
So we don't do that as much as we used to.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.340
And I think that would be a good element to add back into the list of shows that we have today.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.460
Because people like to see that stuff, right?

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.860
Like, people want to see, like, the human side of what's actually happening, right?

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:15.180
Like, let's walk into the team room and let's, you know, let's do the whiteboarding session and let's just kind of talk to the people that actually build a product versus the dude that's on stage or the person that's, you know, at the booth.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:15.500
Right.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.460
Peel back the marketing veneer and just talk straight to the people building it.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:19.700
Right.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.060
Exactly.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:24.000
Paul, Matt, what are you guys doing around that kind of stuff?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.620
Like, are you doing video stuff or things on YouTube or any of those areas?

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.280
Yeah.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.500
So Twilio does have a YouTube channel.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.200
My colleague Brent Schooley is doing some great work there.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.420
He's also, he's been live streaming on Twitch, some live coding, things like that.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:46.780
And the main thing that we do is the team that I run, which is Developer Voices, which is if a developer says to me, hey, like, I built this awesome thing with Twilio.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:54.080
So one of my favorite examples is, like, someone was tweeting about, they took one of the little Amazon buttons, the Amazon dash buttons.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:54.840
The dash, yeah.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:03.400
Yeah, they built a poop button with it because they're, the developer's two sons slept in the same room and he was potty training one of them.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.780
And he said to his son, like, hey, if you have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, like, just push this button.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.960
And it sent him a text message so that he would know, like, okay, let's not wake up the other kid.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.480
Let's go use the bathroom.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.660
And so he was, like, tweeting about this thing.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:24.620
And we had him not only show, like, not only show, like, here's what it is, but actually teach other developers how to build that.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:32.600
Like, that's actually the most exciting thing to me is, like, yes, there's the human element, but it's also, like, how do we show developers how to build what you built?

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.500
Like, recreate this awesome thing that you built.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:40.680
And so that's, like, the main way that we kind of highlight what developers are doing with Twilio.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.120
That's, man, that could be its own show.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.140
That's pretty awesome.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.880
Paul?

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.140
Video channel?

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:47.760
Certainly.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.320
Certainly there should be a patent pending on that idea.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.120
It's going to be on Shark Tank any day now, man.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.100
Check your email.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:02.600
A lot of good ideas that make me feel guilty about things I should be doing listening to Cecil and Matt.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:08.400
When are you going to take your little camera and just, like, walk into Hadi's office or Dimitri's office and just go tell us about this, man?

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:08.840
What are you doing?

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.640
What are you building?

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.320
No kidding.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.760
Actually, I will use you, Michael, as an exemplar.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.340
We historically had done webinars, you know, what's new?

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.380
And blah, blah, blah.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.560
And it was the advocate doing the webinar.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.120
And I decided it would be better to get outsiders to come in and do the webinars and talk to them.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:32.040
And the webinar with you prompted a change in the way we were thinking about doing webinars.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:32.640
Oh, wow.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.240
Yeah, we made it more conversational, split it into segments, took questions at the end of each segment.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:42.300
I had you and I rehearse some banter beforehand to make it sound well-produced.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.840
And the numbers went up.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.680
The survey numbers went up afterwards.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:53.880
I needed to take that lesson and the lessons from Matt and Cecil and do more of those kinds of outward-focused things in 2019.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.160
It's a little bit of that important versus urgent stuff, right?

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:04.760
Like, I don't know about how you all feel, but I'm just like, feel beaten down every day by like little things that are not that important, but they kind of got to get dealt with.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:08.960
And all these great ideas, it's like, you know, maybe one of them will come to reality, right?

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.800
It's crazy.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.440
That's just life though.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.020
What are you going to do?

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:18.400
So I guess if folks out there are listening and they're like, man, this sounds really fun.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.680
I would love to do this.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.900
Be on the cutting edge.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.860
A lot of this technology, work with engineering teams, go to the conferences.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:32.100
What couple of steps do you think someone could take or skills that they need to have so they could go acquire them that would get them on this path?

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:32.920
Cecil?

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:38.120
So like we were talking about earlier, I think in general, first you just have to care, right?

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.500
Like, what are the things that you care about?

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.200
What are the things that you want to work on?

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.080
You know, it's the same thing I tell my students or anybody I mentor.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.240
Like, you just generally just have to care first.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:53.440
And then, you know, once you get on the path, just reach out to your local user groups and, you know, see what's happening.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.280
See what's happening there.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.660
You know, reach out to schools, high schools, middle schools.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.860
You know, maybe you can do like an hour of code thing, right?

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:04.520
Like, just kind of get used to getting out and speaking with people and helping people.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.880
You know, I'm really just trying to understand, like, well, what's your experience like?

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.780
And what are the things that you're having problems with?

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:15.360
And how we can or how, you know, you as a person can help them be better and, you know, achieve their goals?

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.460
Because, again, like you just get into the habit of doing that, right?

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:28.120
And, you know, once you hit those checkboxes, then you're well on your way to, you know, being able to, you know, approach something like an evangelist or advocacy position.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:37.880
I think the getting out there and doing some form of public speaking or teaching or training, like those sorts of things that you're touching on are just so super important.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:53.660
I honestly think if people were to come and ask me, you know, what is one thing that I could learn this month or this year or whatever that I don't already know necessarily I'm not good at or even maybe I'm scared of that would change my career or really improve it?

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.280
I would say public speaking if I'm speaking to developers, right?

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:03.640
Like this ability to get out there and present either in a training context or a conference context or however else.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:12.280
So few people work on that so that if you can do it, I think it would really put you above a lot of folks or at least in a way.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:12.960
You know, it's funny.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.440
We were talking about that the other day.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.880
And so today my team has like a fair amount of folks like geolocated.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:25.480
And one of the things that we kind of speak about is, you know, like your mileage may vary, right?

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.680
Like some folks are better speakers than others and some are better teachers than others.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:33.560
And, you know, some are better on camera and some are better doing podcasts, right?

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:40.360
Or maybe some people are really good at making really compelling demos and they work really great with the engineering team that they create lots of great samples.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.060
Right. Or blog posts writing or something.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:48.600
Or blog posts or maybe publish on your own blog or maybe you publish on some other publication online.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.720
But the thing is, like, you got to kind of figure out, like, what's going to be your way to contribute, right?

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.180
Like, and focus on that.

00:34:55.180 --> 00:35:03.860
And I'm just saying that because, like, if you don't feel like you're comfortable public speaking, it's not to say that you, if I'm not a good public speaker, I can't be an advocate and I can't help people.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.020
You still can.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.460
And it's helpful if you can do some public speaking, right?

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:13.640
But if not, then there's tons of other ways that you can contribute to the community and help people succeed.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.220
Yeah, for sure.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.040
Paul, what do you think?

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.500
A couple of things people could learn to go this direction.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:29.960
To follow up with the last thing that Cecil said, if you think that becoming an advocate evangelist, DevRel, is rock star public speaking, you're in the wrong line of work.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.280
It is the wrong motivation.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:38.880
I'll come back to, I live south of D.C., so Matt can attest to this.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.500
I believe it's recently the worst commute traffic in the country, past L.A.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.920
Yay for us.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.220
Almost number one.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.560
You guys just work a little harder.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.200
You'll get there.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.000
And so I've got a lot of friends that get in the grind and drive and drive.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.840
And, you know, you're not getting paid extra for that hour and a half each way.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.900
And they see my life like, oh, my God, I could work from home.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:07.620
And then I kind of mentally play this scenario in my head.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.820
OK, so you live the high life.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.780
You quit your job.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.120
You work for yourself.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:17.520
And the first month you're sitting in your pajamas staring at the wall, which is not a pretty picture.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.060
Because you're not a self-directed person.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.620
And I came to this from being an independent consultant.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.740
So it's a decade basically managing myself.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:32.380
That's a hard bit to flip, especially if you're like on Cecil's team and it's geographically dispersed.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:37.260
Maybe we'll talk later about there are no good metrics for DevRel.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:45.140
It's any claims that you can measure success and justify budget are propositional at best.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.940
And therefore, how do you know if you're getting your job done?

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:53.020
Well, you got to be a self-directed person who doesn't wait for things to come to you.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:53.800
You go to them.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.300
Yeah, you have to be pretty independent in this job, don't you?

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:00.500
I do think working from home is pretty amazing and not having a commute.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.680
I mean, I do have to cross a little sidewalk, but the traffic's not bad.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.800
Sometimes a squirrel is there.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.400
Sometimes, but it runs away.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.840
So that's pretty beautiful.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:16.280
But there is a lot of self-directed aspect where some days I'm up at six in the morning and I'm working and there's no boss.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.240
There's nobody that said, Michael, you got to be at work at six today.

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.080
You got the things just like, you know, I'm just I'm falling behind on stuff.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.400
So I'm up at six this week.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.480
That's just the way it's going to be.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:24.720
Right.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:36.280
And I think that works really well for people who can leverage it like you because you can take that hour of commute that you would have had and put that into something productive or a hobby where you're more refreshed, whatever.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.040
But if you don't, it can be tough.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:45.400
And I remember when I first started working from home, I had stuff to figure out to make that work.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:45.640
Right.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.320
So my wife would be like, hey, you're home.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.000
Can you take care of this?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.740
Like, we need to do the laundry.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.240
We got to vacuum this floor.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:52.860
And she works, too.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.080
Right.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:53.460
To be clear.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.380
But she's like, could you also just vacuum this?

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.780
I'm like, I'm at work, actually.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.100
I know I'm not gone, but I have got to be working.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.660
It's just really hard to have that separation in time without space.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:05.100
Right.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:10.480
So I don't know, I guess maybe I could come back to what you all do to work well from home.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.940
But Matt, I want to let you weigh in on the two ideas or two points.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:14.660
Yeah, for sure.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:21.860
Well, the very first step, if someone wants to be a developer and developer relations, is to be really deep in your tech stack.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:26.480
I sometimes field questions from folks and they say, hey, I've been programming for a while.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.620
I want to get out of programming.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.240
Can I go into evangelism?

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.380
And I say, actually, that's the opposite thing you want to do.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:40.780
Because when you're a heads down developer like I was for a long time, you have time to focus on really hard problems.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:50.100
And when you're an evangelist or an advocate, typically you have a lot more demands on your time that cause you to kind of have two hours here, maybe three hours there.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.560
Or you're in an airport trying to debug some code.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:39:02.800
So you really have to be deep in your tech stack and just love coding because there's so many other distractions that are there for you when you're traveling or you're writing blog posts, things like that.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.500
I think that Cecil is spot on in that people have different strengths and you should play to your strengths.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:16.100
So if you're really deep in your tech stack and you really love writing, just do that and focus on that and become a better writer every day.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.440
If you like the public speaking side, that's awesome.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:24.920
I mean, that tends to be the most visible because when people go to conferences, they're like, oh, this person is a really great public speaker.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.960
Not everyone has to fall into that boat.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:31.280
But I just think that, you know, you kind of have to figure out, like, what am I really good at?

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.000
You dabble in a bunch of things and say, what are my strengths?

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:44.540
And then it's the combination of being deep in your tech stack and with something else that helps other developers learn, which is really where the power comes in.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.960
And I actually completely disagree with Paul.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.540
I think there actually are significant metrics for measuring ROI to companies.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:40:04.400
And you can tie your own performance to those metrics and be confident that the work that you are doing, regardless of whether it's public speaking or blogging or open source work, is actually really, really valuable to your company.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:04.780
Nice.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.780
We're coming back to that then.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:21.280
So one thing I do want to throw out there, though, one of the shifts that I had when I switched into from being a regular developer to doing training, and I think would be quite similar to developer evangelist, is when you're a regular developer, if you find one way to solve a problem,

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.280
you're good.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.160
You solve your problem.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.320
You check in the code.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.380
You go on to the next thing.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:35.000
But if you are representing a tech stack or a product or you're teaching somebody about one of those, like in the course of training, you need to know, oh, there's actually four ways to do this.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.020
These are the tradeoffs between them.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.620
This is the situation when you use this one versus that one.

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:45.380
And that's just like a different level of digging into learning a technology and a curiosity about it.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.820
It's not enough to, like, make it work one way.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:52.420
You have to understand sort of the tradeoffs in a little bit deeper.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.260
What do you guys think?

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:58.860
Well, I do think you have to be comfortable with explaining something to other developers.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.580
And that's actually where the big leap was for me.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.980
It's exactly what you're talking about.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.840
I can get something to work and then no one asks any further questions.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.000
It kind of passes code review.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.680
Okay, it works.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.120
There's a unit test for it.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.320
Yeah.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:09.680
Let's move on.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.340
User can log in.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:10.660
We're good.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.080
Let's roll.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:16.720
But I mean, it's a little bit scary to me when I write a blog post on how to create SSH keys on Ubuntu.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:23.820
And I don't have a flag that needs to be on there for certain versions of Ubuntu, which causes a security vulnerability.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:30.280
And then, you know, my post is popping up and a lot of people basically have security vulnerabilities in their SSH keys because it's something that I wrote.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.520
Like Matt told me to do it this way.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.820
Well, Matt was wrong this time.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.120
Yeah, no, it was wrong.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.040
And I went back and I fixed it.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.080
But I mean, it was out there for a long time.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.580
So I think that's kind of the leap.

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.860
You have to ask yourself, like, do I feel comfortable with what I'm putting out here?

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.400
Because, you know, there's a lot more people who are reading that.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.160
They're following that.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:51.800
And just like we copy and paste off Stack Overflow, you don't, as a developer, you're just trying to get something done.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.060
You don't always do the work yourself.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.280
You just say, okay, this is a solution to a problem.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.980
I put this in regardless of whether there's an issue with it or not.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:03.440
So I think that's a big leap when you're in one of these roles.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.320
Yeah, kind of like what Matt was saying.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.820
Like, you have to know where the bodies are buried, right?

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.900
Like, you got to know the things that work and the things that don't work, right?

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.460
Because sometimes it's not just about talking about the happy path, right?

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:21.340
You got to talk about, you know, what are the right scenarios for whatever it is that you're talking about?

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:21.960
You know what I mean?

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:27.100
Being able to give people accurate, useful, practical advice on that, right?

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:33.120
I think that's when, you know, you see the differences between, and I'm not throwing shade at marketing people, but like that's where you see the differences

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:39.580
between somebody that's kind of going through a script and somebody that's like, you know, I understand this product that I'm talking to you about it.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:39.780
Yeah.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.020
Right.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:45.660
So like, you know, if you're presenting a particular position, you got to be able to defend that position, right?

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:51.140
Like, kind of like what you're saying, like, hey, if I'm telling you this is how I create SSH keys, like he has to defend that position, right?

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.700
And this is why I do it this particular way or whatever the case is.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:58.300
Or if you say this is how you should use this function and here's why you pass this parameter.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.700
Someone says, well, I'm not really sure.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:00.540
I think it should be this way.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:08.500
It's like, well, let's just disassemble it or pull up the source code and let's look and I'll show you the line where the thing is that, you know, doing this matters, right?

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.180
Things like that.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:14.720
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Rollbar.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.140
Got a question for you.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.860
Have you been outsourcing your bug discovery to your users?

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.500
Have you been making them send you bug reports?

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.200
You know, there's two problems with that.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.160
You can't discover all the bugs this way.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.720
And some users don't bother reporting bugs at all.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.640
They just leave, sometimes forever.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.440
The best software teams practice proactive error monitoring.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:41.820
They detect all the errors in their production apps and services in real time and debug important errors in minutes or hours, sometimes before users even notice.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:46.920
Teams from companies like Twilio, Instacart, and CircleCI use Rollbar to do this.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:53.000
With Rollbar, you get a real-time feed of all the errors so you know exactly what's broken in production.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:00.180
And Rollbar automatically collects all the relevant data and metadata you need to debug the errors so you don't have to sift through logs.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:04.140
If you aren't using Rollbar yet, they have a special offer for you, and it's really awesome.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:13.220

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:33.720
Let's go back to this idea of metrics and what defines success.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:43.320
Matt, I think you're in a really good position because you work with other evangelists and almost in an overseen somewhat angle, so maybe you want to kick it off.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.200
Yeah, so Twilio...

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.460
What are the metrics?

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.080
Yeah, like how do you measure this?

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.380
Like what looks like success for Twilio, and how do you know if you're doing it?

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:58.120
Yeah, so it's very important to tie the developer relations program to the company strategy and the overall metrics that a business has.

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:03.000
And so Twilio's mission is to help developers build the future of communications.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.820
And we want every developer in the world to have Twilio in their tool belt so that if they need to add two-factor authentication to an application,

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:16.620
or they want to build a custom call center for their company, that they say, oh, I can do that with Twilio.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:24.840
And so for us, like a lot of the ROI calculated, return on investment calculations are around how many developers are actually using Twilio.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:32.520
Like we have usage metrics, and we can very clearly tie like which blog posts are actually driving the most usage of various products.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:47.340
You know, I think that's an interesting point because you, in particular with Full Stack Python, are really good at looking at analytics and sort of fine-tuning the web pages and the web stories to really resonate best,

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.060
and then even changing them a little bit.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.600
So it can be done, right?

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:51.720
It absolutely can be done.

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.220
And, you know, I said I kind of disagree with Paul.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:59.920
I also want to agree with him in a way that you have to do what's best for developers.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:04.100
If you let the metrics drive you completely, you're going to do it wrong.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.800
Like you have to be a developer.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:11.080
You have to be a part of your community and know what's right and what's wrong.

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:16.680
And then you kind of have like these internal metrics that show that what you're doing is valuable.

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.100
So there's almost a little bit of two sides to it.

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.520
You have I'm a developer.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.640
I know what's right for my community, and you really want that to happen.

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.220
That's your ideal.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.300
That's what you drive towards.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:34.680
But then you also have the metrics that allow you to justify the expansion of the continued existence and the expansion of a developer relations program.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.200
So you can continue to help more and more developers over time.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:37.500
Yeah.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.060
Paul?

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.120
Yeah, I'll jump in on that.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.200
That sounds great.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.740
I can promise you I'll be following up with you about that.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:48.960
In particular, on the macro side, the team as a whole's impact on the company.

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:56.000
I was talking more in the context of a fairly self-directed job activity.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.880
Should I do this or that task?

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:10.520
And it's pretty hard to get the granularity at the micro level versus the macro level of this blog post led to that impact.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:15.380
And maybe your context allows you to because of both ends of the equation on that.

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.560
Or even giving a conference talk.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:24.940
We debate this endlessly about how to concoct measurements, how many people show up, what were the follow-ups afterwards.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:35.900
So certain activities, if metrics are introduced, create perverse incentives that poison the mission of developer relations.

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.240
That's the worry that I have.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.120
Yeah.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:43.440
I think a lot, too, comes down to the company's strategy and business model.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:49.720
I actually would never be a developer evangelist or work in developer relations for a company that has a free API.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:54.600
Because if it's not worth paying for, then it could immediately be disbanded.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.100
Like Netflix had an API.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:56.580
Gone.

00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:07.060
So to me, to be able to tie the company making money off of an API so that it continues to justify investment is actually what drives a successful relations program.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:12.120
Now, it's harder to do that when you're talking about a subscription model or a one-time purchase model.

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:16.560
So I think a lot comes down to the company's strategy and business model.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.500
Dude, make a PyCon talk this year on this topic.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.280
I'm sure a lot of companies would be interested.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.100
Cecil, how do you guys measure success?

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.740
How do you know if you're doing better?

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:32.720
So this is a problem that we've had that we're continuously trying to iterate over and figure out.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.820
So just for context, my team is maybe about a year and a half old.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:41.100
We started, I want to say, April or so, 2017.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.720
So one of the things that we do is, so we have like this internal dashboard.

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:50.820
But essentially, all we're really doing is just tracking to see, like we're doing click tracking for the most part.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.520
And that's one of the strategies that we use.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:58.620
Because it's kind of hard to say, hey, if I went to this conference and I gave this talk or you watched my video.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:05.280
You know, there's a person that watched the video, going to come and download Visual Studio, and you're going to sign up for an Azure account or whatever the case is.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:05.860
Right.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:10.080
So we do a little bit of click tracking to kind of flow people around and kind of follow them.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:15.220
But even with that, too, like those, that method is a little subjective, I suppose.

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.040
Like how accurate is that exactly at the end of the day?

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:26.760
And like, you know, like who's to say, you know, hey, this person didn't just like pass this thing around throughout all of this company and like take out my tracking link.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:26.940
Right.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.560
So like maybe there's more people that are coming in and they're just not clicking my link.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.400
But maybe I gave it to like you and you shared it around your company.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.740
Like I can't really track those people.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:40.480
And so I kind of look at it as a way to judge like relative change.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:45.500
I think that's a good way for us to look at those things versus like absolute numbers.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:51.820
Because if you look at it relatively, then you could say, OK, well, you know, maybe the strategy that we're taking is a good idea or a bad idea.

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.100
Or, you know, maybe I don't know, like we change the background of the video.

00:49:55.100 --> 00:50:00.260
Like people don't really like to like we should change the background because our viewers just dropped off or something like that.

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:08.600
But yeah, again, for us, it's just something that we're constantly trying to tweak and iterate over and just, you know, try different strategies to see what happens.

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:08.840
Yeah.

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:15.900
I think one thing that's important is that, you know, kind of like what Matt was alluding to a little bit, like we don't like our jobs aren't tight.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.620
And to metrics.

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:19.060
So it's not like there's no competition here, right?

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:19.880
There's no competition.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.060
There's no like, you know, in team fighting.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.540
Oh, I got to get more views than you do.

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:27.840
You know, because again, like when you do that, like now your focus is different, right?

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:36.220
Like you're looking at the wrong thing versus, you know, hey, I'm trying to be at the top of the leaderboard versus I just want to put out good content that people care about.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.100
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:42.120
And you have so many different areas to measure like channel nine versus conferences versus other social.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.240
There's it's hard to know the relative value.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:44.880
I'm sure.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.200
Yeah.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:45.520
All right.

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.760
Well, I think we're getting a little short on time.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:53.220
So I want to close this whole conversation out with I know you all go to a lot of conferences.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.000
You do a lot of presentations.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.040
You do a lot of travel.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:06.860
Maybe you all could just tell like one story of either like a conference that went conference presentation or a travel experience that went crazy or something like that.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:10.640
Like I'll give you the really, really short version for me to give you an example.

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:20.280
Like I was traveling to do some training in Salt Lake City and I decided I got there a little early, decided to go skiing, went up on a Sunday morning, put a snowbird.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:27.320
There was an avalanche to close the road and I could almost not get back down from the thing for my event on Monday morning.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.080
It was like narrowly escaped.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:30.800
It was crazy.

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:37.080
So maybe if you have any funny or weird stuff like that, I know, Cecil, you have a way to get stuck on airplanes.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:41.160
Yeah, I have some interesting stories on airplanes.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:46.360
I think one story I want to tell because I think it has an interesting kind of follow up to it.

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:53.100
So I went to a conference recently and I'm all ready to go, signed up, CFP, submitted and accepted or whatever the case is.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:52:05.280
And then maybe two days before I'm supposed to speak, like the conference organizer sent out this email and they're like, well, there's not going to be any Wi-Fi and you can't use your own machine and like can't do this, can't do this, can't do this.

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:08.820
I'm like, you're telling me this like two days before I'm supposed to go speak to these people.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.840
Like what exactly are you expecting me to do, right?

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:24.320
So again, like for somebody that's trying to show a demo of, I don't know, let's say I'm trying to show a demo of Azure or whatever it is if there's no connectivity.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.120
It makes a demo a little bit hard to do.

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.000
It looks a little bit challenging.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:36.840
So I guess I walked into the room and I was like, hey, well, usually I would have been showing you a demo, but let's just pretend like I ended up telling like a lot of stories, which is interesting.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:46.600
So like now my talk that was supposed to be like 40 minutes with demo turned into, it turned into a lot of interesting conversation with the audience, which I think worked out pretty well.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.660
So instead of me talking actually, like I was talking with you, we're sharing stories back and forth.

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:58.740
So, you know, I think the folks that were in the room still got some value out of it because now they, you know, they got to share their experiences and whatnot, which I think is really cool.

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:07.780
But again, for me, like if anybody that's listening is a conference organizer, please tell your speakers accurate information early and not two days before.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.480
That's crazy.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.220
It's really cool that it turned out all right, though.

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:11.900
That's great.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.120
How about the other guys?

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:19.440
I think the funny thing about the horror stories is after you've been doing this for a while, they kind of fade into the background.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:28.840
And what kind of stays with you are the times when you meet a developer, like at PyCon this year, I met developer Sam who I'd been working with.

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:31.600
He'd been making a bunch of pull requests on full stack Python.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.200
And then he wrote a blog post for Twilio.

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:43.520
And so just to be able to work with them online, you get to meet somebody in person and just kind of swap some stories and then work on them with some other work with that person on some other things.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:51.600
That's just kind of the highlight to me is just the connections that you make that transcend the online part and then you meet offline and stuff like that.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.060
That's probably the best thing for me.

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:53.980
Yeah, that's cool.

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:54.560
Paul?

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.920
I'd say this one's definitely in my wheelhouse because the only value I have to the Python community is funny stories.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:09.880
So like 2000-ish, back in the days of Zope, I was at a free software conference, the big free software conference in Brazil.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:16.040
And I went over somewhere else to do a sprint one day and we got a phone call.

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.600
Paul, get back here.

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:22.940
The governor of whatever state in Brazil.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.280
The governor wants a demo.

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:28.420
No, with a film crew in the press and he wants to sign a proclamation.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:29.440
Oh my gosh.

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:37.020
And you need to come and on behalf of open source, do a meet and greet and sign the proclamation.

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.180
Did you sign it?

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.240
That's the funny part.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:39.940
Or funny.

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:45.640
So I'm rushing back over there with my dear friend, Python hero, Luciano Romala.

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.580
And we're talking the whole way.

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.040
And I'm like, Luciano, we've got an issue.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.600
I don't speak Portuguese.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.800
And I'm going to walk up and right into this situation with no prep.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:03.220
And so we worked it out where I would go over and stand beside the governor and do kind of the handshake and all that kind of stuff.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:08.780
And he would go over and read the damn thing and kind of give me a thumbs up if it was safe to sign.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.380
So we go do it.

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.620
And he does all of his BS.

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:12.520
And I do my BS.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.720
And we turn around to go sign it.

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.140
I can't find him anywhere.

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:16.260
And I'm staring.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:17.400
It's a one page thing.

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.560
I'm like, what do I do?

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.800
So I signed my business partner's name on it.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.540
Oh, there you go.

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.820
It's like you could sign your dog's name or something.

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:26.420
Yes.

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.040
Your pet's name.

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:29.860
On behalf of open source, Rob Page.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:30.500
That's right.

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.480
Fido or green.

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.080
But if there is.

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.420
None of my stories ever have any value.

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:41.340
But if there is a value in this job, you'll be put into situations that you have to extract yourself.

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.760
Absolutely.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.380
That's awesome.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.240
Yeah.

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:48.140
This reminds me of a book called Confessions of a Public Speaker, which is really hilarious.

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.540
I don't know if you've read it, but it's got a lot of great stories like this.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.660
All right, guys.

00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:53.600
We're about out of time.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.660
So I guess we'll wrap it up.

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.740
Normally I ask two questions at the end of every one.

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:59.400
I'll just do one this time since there's three of you.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:03.800
What editor do you use to write some Python or whatever other code?

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.380
Matt, it could go any way for you.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.400
I'm pretty sure I could guess what the other guys are going to say giving their affiliation.

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.800
But I'll let them speak for themselves.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.540
Oh, it's the same.

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:13.380
Vim and Tmux.

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.040
Right on.

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.140
Paul?

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.600
I was doing PyCharm before I was PyCharm.

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.260
Right on.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:18.960
Sezzle?

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:22.320
Honestly, I've spent a lot of time inside of Visual Studio Code lately.

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:27.540
I would say those two are definitely the big up-and-comers, PyCharm and Visual Studio Code.

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:28.720
So pretty cool.

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.160
All right, guys.

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.680
It's been so much fun to talk about all this and all the stories.

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:38.460
And I really think this is a rewarding career path for a lot of folks if they're looking for

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:38.860
a change.

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:43.840
Also really valuable for companies that maybe they should consider reaching out to folks like

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.300
you, making positions like that.

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.560
So thanks for coming on and sharing everything.

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.200
Thanks, Michael.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:48.840
Sure.

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.320
It's been a pleasure.

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:54.040
Now, I've already said goodbye to the guests, and it was so great to have them on the show.

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:58.820
But after we stopped recording, we had a quick conversation about PyCon and hanging out at

00:56:58.820 --> 00:56:59.420
booths and stuff.

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:04.520
And what we decided is, if at all possible, the three or four of us are going to put on an

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:07.380
open space at this year's PyCon in Cleveland.

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:12.240
If you really got into this topic and you'd like to meet the guys, talk more about it,

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:16.860
that kind of stuff, be on the lookout for an announcement around the open space for the

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.580
developer evangelists at PyCon.

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:20.420
You are going to PyCon, right?

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.240
You must go to PyCon.

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.280
Definitely get your ticket.

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.520
There's still some available at the time of this release.

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.780
Hope to see you there.

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.300
And I hope to see you at this open space as well.

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.220
Thanks for listening.

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.740
This has been another episode of Talk Python To Me.

00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:38.200
Our guests in this episode were Cecil Phillip, Matt McKay, and Paul Everett.

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.560
And it's been brought to you by Linode and Rollbar.

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:44.740

That's L-I-N-O-D-E.

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:52.660
Rollbar takes the pain out of errors.

00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:57.260
They give you the context and insight you need to quickly locate and fix errors that might have

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.980
gone unnoticed until users complain, of course.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:05.440

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.420
slash rollbar.

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:08.720
Want to level up your Python?

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:13.520
If you're just getting started, try my Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps course.

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:18.620
Or if you're looking for something more advanced, check out our new async course that digs into

00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:21.700
all the different types of async programming you can do in Python.

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:25.640
And of course, if you're interested in more than one of these, be sure to check out our

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.360
Everything Bundle.

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.240
It's like a subscription that never expires.

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.520
Be sure to subscribe to the show.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.040
Open your favorite podcatcher and search for Python.

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.180
We should be right at the top.

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:39.000
You can also find the iTunes feed at /itunes, the Google Play feed at /play,

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.160
and the direct RSS feed at /rss on talkpython.fm.

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.260
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.760
Thanks so much for listening.

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.820
I really appreciate it.

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:49.580
Now get out there and write some Python code.

00:58:49.580 --> 00:59:03.580
Take care.

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:10.580
Take care.
