00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.740
You know, some of the things we do in life are tedious and boring.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.380
They're the kind of things that machines or maybe robots could do.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.820
So let's build those machines.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.660
This is Talk Python, and we'll be automating the boring stuff with Al Swigert.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.320
It's show number 19, recorded Thursday, July 2nd, 2015.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:48.180
Hello, and welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.620
The language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.960
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.200

Also, follow the show on Twitter, where it's at Talk Python.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.740
This episode, we'll be talking with Al Swigert,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.200
author of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.740
Practical Programming for Total Beginners,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.820
and founder of inventwithpython.com.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.820
This episode is brought to you by Hired and CodeChip.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.540
Thank them for supporting the show on Twitter via

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.920
at Hired underscore HQ and at CodeChip.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.180
Now, before we get to the show,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.920
I do have to apologize for my audio on this one.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.540
The gain on my mic got bumped, and unfortunately, I didn't notice until after the interview.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.680
Luckily, Al's audio is great, and I let him do most of the talking, so it's not too bad,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.160
but the quality is definitely below the bar I try to set for this show, so I'm sorry about that.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.620
Now, let's get to the show.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.480
Let me introduce Al.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.780
Al Swigert is a software developer and technical book author living in San Francisco.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.220
Python is his favorite programming language, and he is the developer of several open source modules for it.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.160
His other books are freely available under the Creative Commons license on his website, inventwithpython.com.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.400
His cat weighs 14 pounds.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.500
Hey, Al. Welcome to the show.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.160
Hey, thanks for having me.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.760
You bet. You got a big cat, man.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.300
Oh, yes.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.480
In Chapter 17, which deals with image manipulation, I use a photo of her,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.240
and she looks especially rotund in that photo, but I have her on a diet now, so she's down to 13 pounds.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.540
Oh, at least it's going the right way. That's cool. I love big cats.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.220
Oh, yeah. I'm pretty sure she might be, like, two cats under a trench coat standing on each other's shoulders, maybe.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.400
That could account for the weight.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.820
Yeah, that's the most likely scenario, I think.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.600
All right. Well, welcome to the show.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.480
Today, we're going to be talking about your new book, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.040
And you just released this, right?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.740
That's right. It came out this past April.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.480
I've been working on it for about a year and a half beforehand.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.840
And, in fact, March of 2014, I left my software developer job to start writing full-time.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.700
I think that's a really brave but awesome thing to do.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.900
Yeah. It was a calculated risk.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.760
I mean, for the decade beforehand, I'd always been working a safe 9-to-5 job.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.000
And so I had some money saved up, and so I thought, well, now's the time to start taking some risks.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.140
That's right. The whole learn-to-code thing is hot.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.780
You're probably at a place in your life where you're able to take that time and focus and so on, right?

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.700
Yeah.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.120
So we're going to talk all about your book and some of the other projects that you've got going on.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.460
But before we get there, how did you get into programming in Python? What's your story?

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:57.520
So I started programming sometime in the third grade, and I really don't like telling that story because it sort of reinforces that, like, oh, no, you have to start programming when you're a little kid or, you know, just as soon as you develop motor skills or something if you want to get good at it.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:09.120
So I always follow that up with all the programming knowledge that I gained between the third grade when I started and probably freshman year of university.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.840
You could probably learn that in every weekend for a few weeks.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.520
So it didn't really give me that much of a boost, but it was definitely something I had been interested in for a while.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:30.860
So I had started with BASIC, and I found this one book that was really great at teaching me how to program.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.240
And this was, you know, before Google and before you could easily find a lot of information.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:52.180
I didn't even really know that I was specifically looking up books on programming because whenever I went to the library and thought, okay, I'll just find computer books, they would just be sort of abstract and say, like, oh, this is the CPU and this is the printer and this is the keyboard and that sort of thing.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.000
It wouldn't actually be talking about loops and variables and other things like that.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.760
But this one book I found, it was great.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.960
It just gave me the source code for all these small little games.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.180
And just from that, I was able to copy that code and then make tiny adjustments to it.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:17.600
So a few years ago, a friend of mine was the nanny for this precocious 10-year-old who wanted to learn how to program.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.020
So I tried to find some tutorial on programming like that, but I really couldn't find anything.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.380
So I just started writing up a short Python tutorial, and that just eventually ballooned into book length.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.300
Which I just self-published.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.260
And people seemed to really like it.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.640
So I wrote a second one and then a third one.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.600
Now you have a habit.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.600
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.160
I kept thinking, like, okay, this will be the last book I write.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.840
And then, oh, well, I got to come out of retirement to pull off one last heist.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.020
So that was Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.300
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.860
What was the name of the original book?

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.000
The original book that I found was Invent Your Own Computer Games.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.020
And back before I realized that this could actually become a huge book.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.220
So my first book was just Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.800
And by the time it had blown up a little bit, I already was kind of stuck with that name.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.440
But it's worked out pretty well.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.500
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.220
I think it's really inspiring to help young people kind of get started.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.100
It sounds like that's where your book came from.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.120
Yeah, it's really great to get emails from people who say, you know, like, I'm 14 years old and I want to learn how to code.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:47.360
And I essentially copied the style of that book of just having the complete source code to small programs instead of just only talking about programming concepts abstractly and then leaving it up to the reader to put all those concepts together to actually make something fun.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:07:01.740
Yeah, I think one of the hugest problems learning to program, and it doesn't really matter whether you're a kid or not, is in order to do anything that is at all interesting or seems like you've accomplished something, you have to learn a bunch of little tiny facts.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.720
Oh, yes.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.360
Yeah, I've got to learn what a for loop looks like.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.000
I've got to learn how to clear variables.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.600
I've got to learn how to import modules.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.260
And you've got to power through that stuff.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.400
And somehow, in your mind, you have to say there will be something good on the other side.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.940
And I think the kind of stuff that you're proposing gets, you know, shortens that gap.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.740
And so fewer people are likely to drop out, I guess.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:34.020
Yeah, I mean, I definitely tried to keep all the, in the first book, all the little game programs anywhere between 50 and 200 lines of code.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.300
I don't think any of the programs are more than 200 lines of code.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.080
Just because you don't really have to have that much code to make something a lot of fun.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.300
And Python is actually great about this.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:08:00.220
When I started writing up, like, a hangman program or a tic-tac-toe program, I realized, oh, wow, if I had written this in BASIC or in some other old programming language, this would have been probably about three or four times as long.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:07.240
And just that much more that I would have to explain in a book, and I would lose, you know, another standard deviation of readers.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.920
That's right.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.120
Here's how you import the header file, and here's how you link the static library.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.520
Oh, right.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.760
And it's like, oh, no, we're done.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.780
And just type out public static void main string args bracket bracket.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.420
We'll go into why later.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.100
Yeah.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.580
Python's great.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.460
Just, you know, hello world is one line.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.600
Yeah, Python is great.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:30.180
What I really think is cool about it is it's appropriate for this, like, my very first experience in programming.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:38.720
And as you probably know, Python is now the most popular language for first year programming courses at universities in the U.S. at least.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.180
Right?

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.340
Oh, right.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.000
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.040
But it's...

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.240
It's eclipsed Java in that regard.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.620
Thankfully.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.660
And it's also appropriate for Instagram.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.680
And it's appropriate for discuss.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.100
And, like, these huge scale professional things.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.360
Right?

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.600
So the fact that it's a spectrum that you don't like, okay, I'm going to learn Scratch until I want to put on my big boy pants.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.000
And then I've got to go learn Java.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.260
Right?

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.800
It's this continuum that is wonderful, I think.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.100
Yeah.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:17.460
I mean, so Python, as you might know, was just based off of this language ABC, which was developed as a teaching language.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:25.720
And it turns out that making a language's syntax just easy and readable is not just good for beginners, but just a good idea in general.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.240
Right.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.280
It basically comes down to the realization that code is read way more than it's written.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.160
Oh, yes, definitely.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:32.680
Yeah.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.860
Definitely.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.820
So let's talk a little bit about your book and some of the topics that kind of surround it.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.900
Sure.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.180
Yeah.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:49.260
So one of the things that you said is, you know, people feel like, what's your quote, that programming is something like intimidating rocket surgery.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.080
And it's just scary.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.680
But probably it shouldn't be.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.840
What do you think about that?

00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:02.540
It's, yeah, programming definitely has that sort of, you know, you have to be a genius in order to understand this.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:07.720
And I suppose a lot of people are less intimidated by computers these days.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.720
Just because they're more familiar.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.220
Just because they're more familiar.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:24.840
But the idea that I can write software, you know, just like Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates can write software and go on to, you know, they, you think that you would have to be a genius in order to program a computer.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.020
And then that goes on to create a billion dollar company or anything like that.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:36.840
Whereas, you know, there's a wide spectrum where, oh, yeah, you could just write little scripts using some, a few programming concepts.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.780
And these scripts can actually be pretty useful.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:46.040
So I started thinking about, well, what kind of things could a typical office worker write?

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:58.380
I mean, a lot of my non-programming friends would tell me, you know, like today at the office, I spent four hours going through a couple hundred Excel spreadsheets and copying and pasting this one line out of all of them.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.460
And I would think to myself, like, oh, wow, you could probably have written a script to do that in 20 minutes.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:10.620
And it would have taken about two seconds to run and you would have been finished and saved yourself an entire day of work.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:10.980
That's right.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.160
Not just that day, but every day going forward.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.660
Yeah, exactly.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:20.960
In your book, you have a cool story about some college roommates working in retail.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960
Can you remember that?

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.420
Can you tell it?

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.580
Oh, yes.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.380
Yeah.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.080
So this story is at the very beginning of the book.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.700
It's one of the things that I remembered when I started writing this.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:35.200
This was, I think, my sophomore year college roommate.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.060
He was telling me about how he was working at this one retail outfit.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:47.020
And every once in a while, they would get a huge spreadsheet of product prices of their competitors.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.800
I didn't ask how they got this spreadsheet.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:58.940
But they would have to go through and type in each, you know, product SKU into their database to find their price.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.420
And then they would have to compare the prices.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:06.740
And they'd just mark it out on these massive printouts that they made of hundreds of pages.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:15.660
And it would be two or three of them just doing this for two days straight and going through and then just checking to see which prices they should lower in turn.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:26.080
And he said, well, you know, if you have the original file that you printed these pages out from, I could probably just write a script to go through and automatically do this.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.160
And, you know, so it took him like a couple hours.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:37.180
And he was just most of that was just consulting documentation and trying to remember how to do various things in C.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.800
But eventually he just hacked out a tiny script.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:49.940
I mean, it was basically look in this spreadsheet, look in this database, and then just see which one's higher and then print out the relevant ones to the screen.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:56.040
So, you know, after a few hours of just writing that code and he ran it and it only took a few seconds to run.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:02.660
And he basically just sort of saved everybody, you know, multiple people, a couple days of work.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.060
Yeah, that's fantastic.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.160
Yeah.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:11.920
And so computers are at this point, everybody, you know, is familiar with has access to computers.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.520
Lots of people have laptops.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.160
Lots of people have mobile phones.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:24.800
But a lot of people don't get the maximum use out of them just because they have to rely on software written by other people.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:37.080
So even if you don't want to become a software engineer, though, learning how to program will allow you to make, I don't know, turn it into a much more useful Swiss army knife that can do anything that you need it to.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.580
There's a lot of people out there like that.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:49.300
You know, if you're a lawyer, if you're a doctor and you run a small practice, there are all sorts of things behind the scenes that have nothing to do with lawyers or nothing to do with being doctors.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.980
But they have to sort of manually go through all this business-y data stuff.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.540
And that'd be ideal for what you're proposing, right?

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.000
Exactly.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.400
Yeah.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.480
It's pretty good when I describe what the programming book is about.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.880
And it's like, oh, well, it's programming little scripts to automate tasks for people who don't want to really become software engineers.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.460
They just want to automate things.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.120
And a lot of people would tell me like, oh, yeah, that actually sounds like a great idea.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.860
So it was really helpful just sort of nine months into writing this.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:23.640
And I have no idea if the world needs yet another programming book or something like that.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:42.420
But it's worked out pretty well just because I think a lot of people recognize that large software companies aren't going to write software that does their particular tasks because they have such a specific workflow that's specific to their own practice or their own organization.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.560
But they would just need a 20-line script to do something.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.220
And they don't even know what it has to do until suddenly they're faced with this task.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.980
So just if they had those programming skills themselves, they could work it out themselves.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.640
Right.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:03.040
I mean, otherwise, they're probably paying thousands of dollars and hiring a consulting company.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.720
Or they're going to somewhere like Elance.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.180
And they're like, have no idea what they're getting.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.960
And maybe even more likely they're just not getting it done.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.380
Right.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.100
Oh, yeah.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:21.600
And once you're going to spending that large amount of money, you sort of want a large application when even that's not necessarily what you really need.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.040
Yeah, that's right.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:33.100
So you really stuck true to your original vision for the book in terms of how you chose topics and how you presented them and how you taught Python.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:40.580
So you threw away a lot of the traditional OO, design pattern, fancy style of programming.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.700
And you said, well, if you're only writing 100 lines of code, what do you really need?

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.360
Yeah.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:58.800
This episode is brought to you by Hired.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:05.260
Hired is a two-sided, curated marketplace that connects the world's knowledge workers to the best opportunities.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.620
Each offer you receive has salary and equity presented right up front.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:14.460
And you can view the offers to accept or reject them before you even talk to the company.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.840
Typically, candidates receive five or more offers in just the first week.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.800
And there are no obligations ever.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.900
Sounds pretty awesome, doesn't it?

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.960
Well, did I mention there's a signing bonus?

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.060
Everyone who accepts a job from Hired gets a $2,000 signing bonus.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:33.360
And as Talk Python listeners, it gets way sweeter.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.680
Use the link Hired.com slash Talk Python To Me.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.940
And Hired will double the signing bonus to $4,000.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.660
Opportunity's knocking.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.280
Visit Hired.com slash Talk Python To Me and answer the call.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.180
Oh, yes, exactly.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:02.520
Like, for example, I don't go into object-oriented programming at all.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.820
I think I might briefly mention it at some point in the book.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.940
But I don't talk about classes or anything.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:15.740
I skip list comprehensions and a whole bunch of other Python nifty little features.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.560
Just because you really don't even need that.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.680
I think somewhere in the first chapter I say something like,

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.200
well, using global variables is kind of bad once your programs get big.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.840
But go ahead and do it.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.900
You're not going to be hurting anything.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.980
Just to keep things really simple.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.060
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.840
By the time you understand why this is a problem and you know how to fix it,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.480
you're going to be doing something different anyway, right?

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.920
You may never reach that point.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.000
So why impose all this structure?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.460
I mean, that's kind of why Python and starting with Python is cool,

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:49.120
is you can start easy but scale up, like I was saying,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.060
to these high-end, full, large-scale web apps, right?

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.100
And so you should maybe take that same approach

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.220
from a how-do-you-write-code perspective as well.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.480
Right, and I was just always sort of suspicious

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.360
whenever I started learning a new language or something like that.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.600
I would go to a library or bookstore and try to find whatever books,

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:13.180
and I would notice like, wow, there's 600, 700-page books on C++.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.780
Do I actually need to know all of this right from the start

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.840
in order to start writing code in this?

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.160
Yeah.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.420
So I really wanted something that just kept to the basic minimum.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.940
Yeah, and what's crazy about that C++ book

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.760
is it was probably just the language.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.640
You still couldn't create a web page.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.240
You couldn't host a web page.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.340
You couldn't talk to a database.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.480
You couldn't show UI, nothing.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.820
Yeah, exactly.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.580
It was just a lot of syntax and maybe the reference material

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.900
for the standard librarian.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.280
Yeah, but let me tell you,

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.420
you could sure create your own operator overload at the end of that.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.340
But still, no window.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.260
Yeah, you'd have no idea why you'd want to make that.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.740
Yeah, exactly.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.060
Yeah, so I mean, a lot of those books are made for software engineers

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.220
who already know how to program

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:01.840
and sort of know all of these concepts already.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.200
Yeah.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.380
So one thing I thought was cool about your book

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.500
is you were using Python 3.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.780
Yes.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:08.700
Yeah.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.980
Yeah, I made the switch to Python 3,

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.500
I think about four or five years ago.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.320
Wow, yeah, Python 3 has been out that long.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:18.940
It has.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.060
Like what, 2008?

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.820
Yeah, originally the first book I wrote was using Python 2

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.140
and somebody recommended like,

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.060
oh, hey, why don't you make it for Python 3?

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.240
And I thought, oh, yeah,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.320
that's one of those simple and obvious things.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.020
So I've been working a lot with Python 3.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.640
At my last sort of day job,

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:41.320
we were still using 2.6, I think.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.620
And that's just because we had a large existing code base.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.740
And I didn't realize how many people were still in that same boat

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:51.360
until I was at PyCon recently in April of this year in Montreal.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.540
And I think during the keynote,

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.520
the speaker asked the entire room of, you know,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.760
several hundred people,

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.700
how many people are on Python 2

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.460
and how many are on Python 3, just a show of hands.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:08.000
And it looked about 80% of people were just still using 2.7.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.720
And just like a tiny minority of the room was on Python 3,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.780
which was sort of astounding for me.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.460
So I'm very specific and particular about telling people,

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.940
if you're going to start a new project

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.880
or you're just learning how to code, go with Python 3.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.620
I mean, at this point,

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.120
a lot of the major modules now have Python 3 support.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.600
So the old excuses of like,

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.120
well, if you want to learn how to use such and such library,

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.200
then you're just going to have to use Python 2 anyway.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.480
So you might as well start with that.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:47.160
So I completely recommend people picking up programming to learn Python 3.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.020
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.060
And I totally agree with you.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:49.380
You know,

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:54.420
I put together my website for the podcast using Pyramid and SQLAlchemy

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.020
and various other packages,

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.240
all Python 3,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:58.920
no harm.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.940
But I understand if you've got a million lines of Python 2 code,

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.360
you might not want to go mess into that.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.060
So it depends whether you're new,

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.260
whether the project is new.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.580
There's a lot of variables there.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.240
Yeah.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:08.860
Yeah.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.940
But I think it's cool that,

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.220
you know,

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.420
you're at least starting people off down that path as the default.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.800
And then maybe they've got to change for some reason.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.340
Kenneth Wright was talking about an interesting data point.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.520
The Django guys,

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.760
they traditionally had their documentation in Python 2,

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.400
and they switched it to Python 3.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.640
Just by switching the documentation's default view to Python 3,

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.680
it increased the usage or something like by 4% of Python 3.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.080
It was like,

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.640
wow.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.840
Maybe it was only for Django.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.840
Or it was for,

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.160
I think it was for Python in more general.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.380
I have to look at the graphs again,

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.240
but it was pretty crazy.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.380
Yeah.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.940
A tiny push in this direction.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.280
And I think that's a lot of the things is that Python 3 isn't,

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.360
I mean,

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.080
it has a lot of new and great stuff in it,

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.420
but it isn't so completely new that it has a,

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.060
has a lot of killer features where people are thinking,

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.100
we must go to Python 3.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.040
A lot of the times people say,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.240
well,

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.460
Python 2 is what we know,

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.300
so we'll just go ahead and stick with that.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.900
So I think that it just needs to get that inert,

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.460
initial inertia going.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:13.900
Yeah.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.900
I'd love to see some killer feature come into Python 3 only and,

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.260
and really encourage people to switch.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.180
But like you said,

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:19.960
I don't think we're there yet.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.960
Yeah.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.920
so one thing you do in the book that I thought was really interesting.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.080
And I think most programming books would absolutely skip,

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.460
but makes such perfect sense for the audience and experience level that you're

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:38.120
targeting is you actually teach people how to use Google and stack overflow to get

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.160
programming answers.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:39.980
Yeah.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:40.220
That,

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:40.240
that,

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.000
that came from,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.400
uh,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.360
I put my email address in my,

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.700
in my first book and I said,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:44.960
Hey,

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.740
you should just go ahead and email me,

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.420
uh,

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.200
if you have questions.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.180
And so I would get,

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:49.740
uh,

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.260
emails from people.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.400
And I remember growing up,

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:58.640
I had like RTFM shouted at me on an IRC channel all the time.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.820
And I was thinking like,

00:22:59.820 --> 00:22:59.960
Oh,

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.340
that's really obnoxious and annoying.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.360
Um,

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.140
but I could see the,

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.680
the intent behind that was to make people more self-sufficient.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.860
Um,

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.360
so I would get a lot of questions where people would say like,

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.080
how do I do this?

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:12.660
And I thought like,

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:12.840
Oh,

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.020
well,

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.540
here's the terms that you can Google.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.700
And so at the very beginning of the book,

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.500
I sort of wanted to help people say like,

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:19.860
okay,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.860
so programming might be hard at times,

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.620
but you can always just Google for,

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.020
you know,

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.200
if you get some error message,

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.560
which will never make sense whatsoever,

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:28.880
like,

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.740
uh,

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:34.480
the common example I use is if you forget to put the ending quote on a string,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.340
the error message isn't,

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.840
you forgot to put a quote,

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.180
uh,

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:38.820
to end the string.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.100
It's,

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.000
it's something like E all,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.680
uh,

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.440
syntax error at unterminated string or something like that.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.300
And you have no idea,

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.360
like,

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.980
even if you're a native English speaker,

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.240
you have no idea what that means.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.420
So I just wanted to say,

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:51.680
look,

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.100
it's okay.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:58.420
You can just copy and paste that entire message into Google and you'll find a bunch of websites where people

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.120
have had this exact same problem.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:00.760
Uh,

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.280
the top three results will probably be stack overflow.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.100
Uh,

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.680
and then they can just learn of like,

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:05.840
oh,

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.500
there's a site stack overflow and I can ask questions there.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.460
Um,

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:14.400
especially because after a while I noticed people would be emailing me the same questions.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:14.980
So I thought,

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.180
oh,

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:15.360
well,

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.300
it's not really efficient for me to individually send out this answer each time.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.880
So making people more self,

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.460
uh,

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.740
self-sufficient in finding answers for themselves,

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.600
I thought was something I wanted to have right at the start of the book.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.500
Yeah,

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.180
that's really cool.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:29.920
And you know,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.440
it's as programmers,

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.740
we know that you can put insane stuff in and search for it.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.320
But when you were learning,

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:37.720
you know,

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:43.580
you don't necessarily know you can just put like an error code or other bizarre stuff into Google and get insanely detailed answers.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.440
Yeah.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.940
Yeah.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.480
one time I had a friend who had,

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:46.720
um,

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.240
outlook,

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.920
like small business edition match with some weird thing on windows.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.220
And it like went crazy and lost all of his email.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.260
And he said,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.920
I know you're not really into this,

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.620
but I know you know computers.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:58.800
Well,

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.580
cause you just look at this and help me.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:00.860
I'm like,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.060
geez,

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.840
I don't mean I'm not an outlook person.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.760
I don't really know,

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.680
but it came up and said,

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.220
you know,

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:06.820
error,

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:07.680
OX,

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.920
that had some huge,

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.100
long hexadecimal error code or something.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.460
So I just typed outlook and that thing into Google and bam,

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.620
there was the exact steps to fix the problem.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.020
And I'm like,

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:17.300
look,

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.340
just what you can do.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:18.520
Just,

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.000
and he's like,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.400
how is this even possible?

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:20.700
Right.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.420
It's just,

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:21.760
you know,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.680
we take it for granted,

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.940
but I think it's cool that you show people how to do that.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.420
Cause it's surprisingly effective.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.500
Yeah.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:27.920
I mean,

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.620
I had a friend,

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.140
uh,

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.280
she wasn't a programmer,

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.240
but she worked at a biotech startup and wasn't,

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:34.540
uh,

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.940
there as in an IT role or anything like that,

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.100
but she effectively became this small company's IT department.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:45.420
I think because she was the only person who wasn't afraid to just Google how to do stuff.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.440
Whereas everybody else was just like amazed and thought she was really great at computers or something.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:49.760
It's like,

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:49.980
no,

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.340
she can just sit down and she's not afraid to say,

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.000
you know,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.380
Google for SharePoint server set up and just do all the,

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:57.640
yeah,

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.520
follow all the steps.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:58.720
Yeah.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.200
That's awesome.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:25:59.420
I,

00:25:59.420 --> 00:25:59.940
one of,

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.400
there was some study done that said,

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:01.600
you know,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.780
what is the most important,

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.360
uh,

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.060
personality trait for successful startup founders?

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:07.380
And,

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.300
and basically for people creating companies and what was the most tech companies in particular.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.340
And it turned out the most important thing was simply persistence,

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.900
not being super smart or whatever.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:17.520
Right.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:17.940
Right.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.460
Just having that tenacity.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:19.740
Yeah.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:20.540
And this is part of it.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:20.740
Like,

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.980
I'm just going to keep searching,

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.320
keep digging until I get there and just being effective.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:24.940
That's cool.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.060
Another thing that you have in a lot of the sections is you've got like practice questions

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.600
and you've got even challenges.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.200
So that's really nice to have some hands-on component.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.400
Yeah.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.000
I didn't have those in the first couple of books I wrote and I kept getting emails from

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.500
people who said like,

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:41.740
Oh,

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.340
it'd be great if I had practice questions.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.920
I always thought that was just something that,

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.660
you know,

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:45.920
was,

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.780
was sort of just filler and nobody actually really followed through with those.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.800
I remember whenever I read programming books,

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.640
I would kind of like,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.440
you know,

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.880
answer a few of them maybe,

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.440
or sometimes I'd just skip them.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.340
But a lot of people started thinking like,

00:26:59.340 --> 00:26:59.880
Oh yeah,

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.340
it'd be great to have those practice questions.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.340
And also I would get teachers and professors saying,

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.100
Oh yeah,

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:05.720
I love your book.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.560
It's great.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.420
I'm using it for,

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.400
for this course,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.460
but there's no practice questions or,

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.200
or any exam material or things like that.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.040
It'd be great if,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.080
if a book had that.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.880
So that really opened my eyes to just how many people could,

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.720
could find this information useful.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.000
And also I,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.120
I wanted to sort of keep focus on having the,

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.340
the source code to actual programs,

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.400
um,

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.520
and not just have this be a laundry list of programming concepts that,

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.260
that I just,

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.180
you know,

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:35.400
Oh,

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:35.940
these are loops.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:36.680
These are variables.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.640
These are functions.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.900
Uh,

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.180
and,

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:43.180
and have it as just that I wanted to have actual complete programs as well that

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:43.620
people could,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.400
could see.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.100
Yeah,

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:45.540
that's great.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.520
Do you have your,

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:46.820
uh,

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.740
finished examples and programs on something like GitHub?

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:50.660
Uh,

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.660
they're on the no starch.com,

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:53.260
uh,

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.900
slash automate stuff website.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.280
Okay.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:55.880
Uh,

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.660
there's a link there.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:57.220
It says like,

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.320
here's the zip files for,

00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.020
for all the,

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.580
all the programs and things.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:00.920
That's cool.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.120
So people can go download them.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:02.900
Yeah.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.640
Yeah.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:03.940
Nice.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:09.060
so we talked a little bit about why you chose Python over other languages,

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.580
but there,

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.160
there's certainly,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.940
it seems like there might be some trade-offs.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:13.280
Like,

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.580
suppose you want to do that work with Excel.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.600
I know if maybe you chose something like.net,

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.760
you could use like the,

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:24.300
the calm integration on windows to directly integrate with Excel and stuff like,

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.080
you know,

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:25.720
what,

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.360
what were your,

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.200
what was your thought process of choosing Python over the other various things?

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.260
I,

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.920
to be honest,

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.420
I really didn't spend that much time thinking about it.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:35.740
Uh,

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.980
mostly because Python was,

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.380
was such an obvious,

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:38.920
uh,

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.400
first language to learn.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.100
It has a,

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.120
it has such a great learning curve,

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:43.760
um,

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.800
that I thought,

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.220
well,

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.700
everything else I can just kind of figure out after that,

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.600
because I didn't want to choose,

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:56.200
go with a different language just because it would make some other things easier.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:56.800
I thought,

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:56.960
well,

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.680
Python's great.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.140
It's,

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:58.720
uh,

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.820
it's mostly the same.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.360
if you have windows or a Mac.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.160
Yeah.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.040
The cross platform part of it's really nice.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:05.360
So,

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:05.960
yeah.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.320
And,

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.220
and it turns out there's,

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:11.800
there's plenty of modules for doing things like working with Excel spreadsheets and reading

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.640
word documents.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.180
Uh,

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:13.300
yeah,

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.120
that was actually a little surprising to me because I've never tried to work with Excel

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.080
from a Python,

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.160
but it sounds pretty easy.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.920
Maybe you could talk a little bit about the,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.100
uh,

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.780
the second half or second segment of your book.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.180
So the first half is all about,

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.420
here's how you get started with programming.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.940
Here's like loops and in a really approachable way,

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.040
but then you get into like,

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.540
let's automate some things.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.020
Can you talk about some of the things?

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.720
This episode is brought to you by code ship.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.400
Code ship has launched organizations,

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.360
create teams,

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:57.080
set permissions for specific team members and improve collaboration in your continuous delivery

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.580
workflow.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:02.220
Maintain centralized control of your organization's projects and teams with code chips,

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.460
new organizations plan.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.220
And as talk Python listeners,

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.980
you can save 20% off any premium plan for the next three months.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.100
Just use the code talk Python,

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:11.800
all caps,

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.540
no spaces.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.280
Check them out at code ship.com and tell them.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.980
Thanks for supporting the show on Twitter,

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.240
where they're at code chip.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.260
Yeah.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:24.720
I mean,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.220
I wanted the book to be for complete beginners.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.920
So I have that first part of the book,

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.140
which is assuming you don't know anything about programming whatsoever,

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.980
but I thought,

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.200
well,

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.540
it'd be nice to actually have like in the second part,

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:41.440
go into all these different third party modules that make doing all these different tasks easier.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.220
So there's,

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:48.140
there's a chapter on web scraping using Selenium and beautiful soup and requests.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.220
And,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:56.440
and then also another chapter on using OpenPy Excel to work with Excel spreadsheets and things like that.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.920
I was really surprised at how many modules were out there that,

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:07.040
that were actually pretty high quality and projects that I hadn't really heard of before until I started looking for them.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.880
And so a lot of the,

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.000
a lot of the initial work of writing out this book,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.960
was just going through and mapping out,

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.160
okay,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.780
what are the problems that have to be solved?

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.740
What modules are available out there?

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.620
And Python is,

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.240
is pretty well supported in that regard.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:20.900
Yeah,

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.680
I think you're right.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.660
I think the whole PyPI package stuff,

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.480
I mean,

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.520
there's 56,

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.840
57,000 of those,

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.140
right?

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:28.800
A lot of them.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.120
Yeah.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:29.520
Yeah.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.380
And it's,

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:30.940
it's great.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:38.280
There was the whole XKCD cartoon about Python where he just typed import anti-gravity and you,

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:38.780
that kind of,

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.720
that kind of sums it up,

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:39.920
right?

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.240
Yeah.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:41.600
Yeah.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.760
there's the,

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.880
the concept in,

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:48.380
in a lot of the Python documentation of Guido's time machine where Guido Van Rossum,

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:53.800
the creator of Python would commonly reply to email lists when people said like,

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.620
I'd really need a module to do such and such.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.560
And he would reply like,

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.020
oh yeah,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.680
I just committed a module that did that last night,

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.820
leading a lot of people to think that he actually has a time machine and can start writing these code,

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.740
this code before you even think of it.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:08.080
Yeah.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:08.560
That's awesome.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.280
You've got this book.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.180
You have your two other books.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:15.940
You also said you've done a couple of open source projects or packages for Python.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.440
Do you want to speak about that a little?

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.600
Yeah.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.880
What became the most popular of them so far is,

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.840
is one that I actually wrote for the book.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.620
It was for chapter 18 on,

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.180
on controlling the keyboard and mouse.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.220
I found a lot of code out there that,

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.900
well,

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:39.120
I wanted a module that first worked on Python 2 and 3 and also worked equally well on Windows,

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:39.380
Mac,

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:39.860
and Linux.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.500
And so I would find a lot of great modules,

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:42.880
except,

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.180
you know,

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.140
some of them would only be for Python 2,

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.760
or some of them would only be for a particular operating system.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.040
or sometimes the API was,

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.700
just had a bunch of odd names for things.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.920
So I wanted something really simple.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.880
So I created PyAuto GUI,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.960
which gets a few thousand downloads each month now,

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.340
and especially now that the book is out and covers it.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.900
But it was basically just taking all the best parts of code from all these various modules

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.140
and putting them into this unified interface.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.380
So you have,

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.380
and it's really simple.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:22.840
You just import the module and it has a click function or a typewrite function to just type out an entire string.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.760
Or if you want to press down certain keys,

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.220
those are all just single functions.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.720
So I really like that.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.460
Before I had started writing this automate book,

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.340
my second book was on PyGame.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.920
And so I'd written a few modules for that,

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.580
which one,

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.280
which was PigCurse,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.140
which is sort of a curses emulator,

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.580
except built on top of PyGame.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:49.600
And that was just so that I could have some way of writing text to a certain cell.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:55.520
Like I could tell the cursor to go to some XY position and then start typing out things like that.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.600
Just because again,

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.340
you know,

00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.740
Python has curses,

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.960
but then for Windows,

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.960
there's a separate console module

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.440
that you would have to install.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.500
So there's no unified thing that just works on all operating systems.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.620
And then also,

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.140
there was a PigAnim,

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:17.180
which is a sprite animation module that I made for PyGame.

00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:17.980
Nice.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.960
For building like 2D,

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.800
little side scroller apps,

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.580
that kind of thing.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:22.640
Yeah,

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:22.980
well,

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:28.060
it's basically just to be able to take like an animated GIF and put it into your program.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:28.900
I mean,

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.900
PyGame is great because it would make it really easy just to display an image in a window somewhere.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.120
But if you wanted to have,

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:35.780
you know,

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.100
a little like animation of a running character or something like that,

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:44.040
you would have to program all that logic in yourself because PyGame was fairly bare bones.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:51.280
And I looked around and I saw that nobody else had made something like this in particular for PyGame.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.720
So I just started that as like a week long project.

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.380
And I've written a few other modules,

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:55.800
but,

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.520
you know,

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.680
they're all just really tiny and just have like,

00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:58.940
you know,

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.720
a hundred downloads a month on PyPI.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.360
But yeah,

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.880
just a lot of really simple things.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.360
Yeah,

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.020
that's really great.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:05.960
All right.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.720
Albert,

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.140
I think this might be a good place to wrap it up.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.280
But before I let you go,

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.140
let me ask you a few questions that I typically ask people on the way out.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.020
In addition to PyAuto GUI,

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:21.400
what other PyPI packages are your favorite or most useful or you think,

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:21.920
you know,

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.760
people maybe don't know about you should tell them about?

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.520
Oh,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.380
I think really at the top of that is Selenium.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:32.240
The web scraping chapter on the book's website,

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.180
I think the web scraping chapter is the most popular one.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:41.220
And so Selenium basically launches Firefox or,

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.520
or a different browser and lets you programmatically control it.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:50.060
So you could just automate doing web scraping or filling out forms or anything like that.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.260
And I'd heard of Selenium and other things before,

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.000
but I always thought like,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.220
oh,

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.360
it must be this really complicated thing that you have to,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:58.760
you know,

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.020
spend an entire weekend reading up on.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.280
I didn't realize,

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:02.520
oh,

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:02.780
actually,

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:02.960
no,

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.280
it's about,

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:03.720
you know,

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.900
four or five different functions that you have to learn.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.380
And then you can pretty much,

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.700
and then you're set after that.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.540
So Selenium is,

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.820
is definitely one of my,

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:12.920
it's,

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.660
I'm completely amazed at how much you can do with it,

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:16.980
even with,

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:17.360
you know,

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.780
a very little knowledge and very little time learning about it.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.140
Yeah.

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:21.640
That's awesome.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.500
It seems like you could almost do like basic load testing,

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.680
integration testing,

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.600
other types of sort of web automation with it,

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:29.780
right?

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:30.720
Oh yeah,

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.080
exactly.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.480
I mean,

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.740
because it's actually launching a,

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.160
a web browser,

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:40.480
you can have it work with whatever browser plugins you have,

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.960
or it'll run JavaScript on the page.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.300
So,

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:43.920
you know,

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.360
it's not just downloading files from a URL.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.040
You can actually simulate the JavaScript as well,

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.040
and then see how it looks like for the,

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.620
for the user.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.000
It's,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.180
it's a really great module.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:54.620
Yeah.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.180
That's excellent.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:55.940
Yeah.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:56.560
Make all those,

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:56.920
uh,

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.580
client side spa type apps actually show what they're supposed to show.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:00.860
Right.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.200
Yeah.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.000
Nice.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.280
Okay.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:04.620
Uh,

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:05.160
next one.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:05.420
Uh,

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:05.700
are you,

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.200
what kind of editor are you using these days?

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.640
Uh,

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.100
I really like sublime text.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:11.940
Um,

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:12.700
I mean,

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.680
for the longest time I use this one text editor called edit text,

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.940
which was sort of like notepad plus plus.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.660
Well,

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.260
not like there is actually an editor called notepad plus,

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:24.520
plus,

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.940
but it was all the things,

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:26.580
uh,

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.480
I'm on windows.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.880
It was all the things of notepad.exe,

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.840
except it had a light,

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.320
a lot of other nice features,

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.780
but it was still fairly lightweight.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.220
I've never actually gotten around to learning,

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:36.960
uh,

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.280
Vim or Emacs to any great extent where,

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:40.560
you know,

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.820
I can sit down and use them,

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.580
but I,

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.020
I think I like using the mouse too much.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:45.460
Yeah.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.020
Yeah.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:46.440
I hear you.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.220
Okay,

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:47.820
cool.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.040
Yeah.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.060
I like sublime as well.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.620
It's really nice.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.540
Yeah.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:51.580
And in the book,

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.060
I just say,

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.060
go ahead and use idle.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:53.780
Um,

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.400
because it just comes with Python if you're on windows.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.440
And so you don't have to,

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.980
you would have to do any setup or configuration,

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.220
which is really nice.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:01.460
Yeah.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.040
That is great.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.540
And it's all,

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.980
it's all about reducing the friction and getting people to like have those moments of,

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:06.780
Hey,

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.380
I've created something rather than why do I care about how to declare a string?

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:10.740
Yeah,

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.340
exactly.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.560
That's awesome.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.440
Okay.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.160
So what,

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.500
what do you want to give a final shout out to let everybody know about your book,

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:18.860
obviously?

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.120
Oh yes,

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:20.960
definitely the book.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.340
Uh,

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.100
it's released under a creative commons license,

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:27.080
so you can actually read it online at automate the boring stuff.com.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:27.980
Um,

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.440
but also I'd like to just encourage people to go ahead and make it out to PyCon.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.420
It's,

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.740
it's a really great conference.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:35.220
Uh,

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.780
you don't have to be a heavy technical person to,

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.440
to get a lot of benefit out of.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.940
And the people in the community are really wonderful.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:43.660
Yeah,

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.320
that's awesome.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.820
I would like to second that as well.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.880
And this year it's in Portland,

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.220
Oregon,

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.060
which is my hometown.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.500
And so that's pretty awesome.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.020
And I'm trying to get together a,

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.280
some kind of session.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.360
That's like a,

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.620
a panel discussion,

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.560
live podcast presentation.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.020
So maybe I'll be able to pull that off.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:38:59.460
That'd be fun.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:00.440
Oh yeah,

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.100
that sounds great.

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.340
Yeah.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.260
People should definitely come to it.

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:03.840
It'll be great.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.540
And then I also want to encourage people to go check out your book and maybe even buy it,

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:08.840
right?

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.520
Like you,

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.420
you've done some really cool stuff.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:10.560
Yeah.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.200
And it is available,

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:12.940
you know,

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.940
sort of separate pages as HTML and you can check it out,

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.780
but you know,

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.120
it's not that much.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.800
So support the work.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.560
Yeah.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:25.480
A lot of people really like having it all combined on their Kindle or just having the physical book in their hand.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:25.880
Right.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.280
Absolutely.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.800
All right,

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:27.980
Al,

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.100
thanks for being on the show.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:29.700
It's been fun.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.580
Oh,

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:30.840
thanks.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.020
Yeah.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.200
It's been a lot of fun for me too.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:32.920
Yeah.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.060
