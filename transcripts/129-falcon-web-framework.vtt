WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.860
Full-featured web frameworks are great, but sometimes living closer to the network layer

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.780
is exactly the thing you need. This week, you'll meet Kurt Griffiths and John Varbenak,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.500
who work on the Falcon Web Framework. It's a bare-metal Python web API framework for building

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.280
very fast application backends and microservices. How bare-metal? Well, other frameworks like the

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.500
HUG REST framework are even built upon Falcon. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 129, recorded

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.700
July 17, 2017.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.320
Hi. Thanks for having us.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.200
Yeah. It's great to have you guys here. I love talking about web frameworks, and yours looks

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.500
very, very interesting. So I'm super excited to share it with all the listeners. But before

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.680
we do, let's start with your stories. Kurt, how did you get into programming Python?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.260
Well, so just programming in general, I got started way back in the day in sixth grade. I was in

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:45.080
my math class, and they had a, I think it was probably a Commodore or a Pet, one of those old

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.720
crafty machines. And someone, one of my classmates just came in one day and said, hey, check this

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.560
out. And he brought up the basic terminal, and he typed in this little program. And all

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.860
it did was convert dollars to, I think it was to yen. Nothing fancy, but like I'd never seen

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.240
someone program before like that. And they just kind of sparked my interest. And I thought,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.020
that's so cool. You can like type incantations into the keyboard and the computer will do something

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.080
for you. So that's kind of how I got started.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.540
Yeah, that's really nice. And it probably didn't seem like unachieable. You're like, how did you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.500
do that? Oh, that's all? Well, that seems pretty easy. I could do this, right?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.300
Yeah, exactly. It was very approachable. And I think probably a lot of people got introduced

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.660
to that, to computing. So this was back before a lot of people had computers at home. And

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.680
some of their first interactions with them were like at school. So yeah, I went home and I did

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.460
a little research. I found out that not long after that, my dad brought home an old surplus

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.820
IBM XT from work. And I found out it had basic on it. And so I saved up my allowance for a few months.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.480
And much to the astonishment of my sister, thought I was wasting all my money. I spent it all on a

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.860
programming book. And then kind of the rest is history.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.500
That's awesome. What was the first language? What was that book on?

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.720
Yeah, basic was first language. I went on from that to, I think it was C++. And I've kind of,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.200
I've learned a lot of languages on the way. So I've actually been doing Python probably for about

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.180
about five years now.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.600
Nice. How'd you get introduced to Python?

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.380
So that was after I came on board to Rackspace. And we were doing some projects there. And we'll

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.480
probably talk about this a little bit later. But I was actually doing a lot of C++ at the time. And

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.520
we had done some C++ on the server, but that's not very fun, I have to admit. So we were looking for

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.600
something a little more friendly for that environment, something a little more easier to work with.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.760
And kind of settled on Python. A lot of other people were using Python at Rackspace. And so it was kind

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.660
of a natural choice. And I started doing some Python things.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.600
Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Did you miss the curly braces? And the semicolons?

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.800
It took some getting used to that I must admit. But now I have the opposite problem. I go back and I

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.620
keep forgetting the curly braces.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.940
Yeah, I hear you. I've made a new rule for myself. I'm going to try to write JavaScript with no curly

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.500
braces. If it's willing to add it, I'm willing to not write it.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.200
Yeah, there you go.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.080
How about you, John?

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:16.340
Yeah, so I actually got started programming whenever I was a little kid. My father was an electrical

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:26.100
engineer for Cisco Systems. And whenever I was seven, he introduced me to DOS and BASIC. And

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:34.220
quickly kind of outgrew that and then ended up in Borland's Turbo C++. So that was my first taste of a

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.900
real language, I like to say.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.680
Yeah, yeah. C++ is a good language.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.040
Yeah, especially back in those days. It was, you know, the days of, you know, no stack overflow and

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.340
spending a bunch of time in the Barnes and Nobles or borders, you know, in the programming language aisle.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.060
Back when you had to earn your knowledge?

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.760
Yes, yes.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.940
That's right. So how'd you get to Python?

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.520
So interestingly enough, I've been getting involved in a lot of Linux work. This would have been, what,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:12.720
2012-ish. And at the time, I was having to do a bunch of build scripts and whatnot in using Gradle.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.980
And I kind of got really tired of doing a lot of that. And I was like, well, a lot of people use

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.940
Python. So I started getting interested in that just from a scripting perspective. And then I think it

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.980
was App Showdown or something or whatever it was called back then. And I thought, well, let's try to

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.260
write an app. And I think that was the worst Python I've ever written in my life. But it got me

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.600
very interested in it.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.880
Oh, yeah. That's really, really cool. All right. So what do you guys do day to day? Kurt,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.060
I'm guessing from the background, you might be at Rackspace right now?

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.500
Yep. So I've been at Rackspace about nine years. I'm actually going to be leaving pretty soon here

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.980
to kind of work on some startup ideas. So I've done a lot of stuff at Rackspace. Most recently,

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:02.120
I've been working on sort of, well, what we call managed security at Rackspace. So we provide a lot

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.320
security services for customers. We take vendor products and we kind of wrap them up and glue

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.640
them together and make them easier to use and provide a 24-7 SOC that's staffed by security

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.640
analysts that kind of watches our customers' servers, make sure that we kind of keep the

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.540
bad guys out. So I've been working in the security space probably for about three years now.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:29.140
Yeah, that's really cool. So what kind of stuff can you guys do to keep hackers out? Like for me, I

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.780
make sure I patch my code straight away, you know, as soon as any security updates come out,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:41.000
try to follow the best practices and stuff. But beyond like simple guidance, right? Like can you,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.400
how do you detect these things?

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.460
Yeah. I mean, there's certainly just the basic stuff that you need to do, the patching,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.580
et cetera, that you mentioned. The Center for Internet Security publishes a number of hardening

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.540
guidelines. A lot of people follow, especially if they need to get PCI compliance or something like

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:03.460
that. So you kind of do, you do your basics. Beyond that, the attackers have become so sophisticated

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.420
these days that like, it's really not when they're going to get in, but I mean, it's not really,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.540
not really if they're going to get in, but when.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.540
Not if, but when.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.460
So, so that kind of falls into how do you monitor constantly? How do you react quickly

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.620
when you would detect an anomaly and you've got to get in there and diagnose it and find

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.900
out, well, maybe it's just, you know, you change something in your application. So it's fine.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.300
It's just behaving a little differently. Sometimes maybe, yeah, someone's in there and you need

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:37.700
to kind of throw down the, the firewalls and, and get them out. So it's a combination of

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:43.880
kind of the hardening, the patching, but also the constant 24 seven vigilance and having a

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.700
response plan in place. So you can react quickly and resolve the issues.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.400
Yeah. I'm sure you have some, pretty amazing stories, but let's stay focused on Falcon.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.960
John, how about you? What do you do day to day?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.260
So I actually work in a rack space managed security as well. I'm relatively new to the team.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:08.480
I previously came from EMC and then previous to that, I actually was in a different part of rack

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.800
space. So kind of jumping around the industry a little bit.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.820
You live in the cloud.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:21.680
Yeah, pretty much. I think, a lot of what I do day to day is help, build some of the

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:28.400
utilities that we use internally to manage security. So helping in delivery of some of the, some of the

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:35.920
products and helping isolate what, and how we're, how we're using our tooling. So, yeah,

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.720
it sounds cool. Like I said, I'm sure you guys probably have awesome stories that would be really

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.980
fun to dig into, but let's talk about your web framework Falcon. It looks, looks really neat.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.980
Kurt, you want to tell us what is Falcon?

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.060
Well, so just basically it's a little Python web framework for building microservices,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.980
proxies, application backends, those sorts of things with a particular emphasis on, on low latency,

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.220
high scale use cases.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:05.600
Yeah. So one of the ways you describe it as a bare metal Python web framework. So yeah,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.600
that kind of gives you a sense, right? It's not, it's not Django with its admin backend and,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.140
and that it's, it's something way more low level and closer to the network, right?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:21.820
Yeah, definitely. So it's a relatively thin layer on top of whiskey. so there's not a lot between

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:29.220
you and your web server. And it also tries to kind of embrace HTTP versus paving over it. So you have

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.320
direct access to everything that's going on.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.000
Yeah, that's cool. Headers, requests, response, all of that codes, all those things are super

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.880
natural in there. Yeah. Yeah. So people listening to whiskey, web service gateway interface,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.300
like the standard that almost every Python web framework implements to be a Python web framework

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:54.240
and plug into the high performance web servers. So you have a nice little, problem for people to

00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:01.180
solve math problem on your homepage. You said you've been unburdening cloud apps for over 4.5,

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:07.380
three times 10 to the next second centuries. So you've been around about 4.5 years or so. Is that right?

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:12.560
Yeah, that's about right. I kind of stole that from ours. Technica used to have a little thing in,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.540
in kind of the early days when they're getting started, they used to have a little thing on their

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:22.280
website. so I have to give them credit for that. Yeah, it's nice. Yeah. So why don't you guys

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:28.680
both tell me, Johnny first, what's your relationship to the product? Like, or to the project? Like,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.120
did you both start it together? Someone, one of you started first, I'll come along later.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:40.180
I got involved in Falcon a little bit further into its, into its history. I suppose, my initial

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:49.360
use was purely as a user. I, was using it to, to solve several scaling problems from just like a

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.700
general sense from a performance standpoint. But overall, I kind of, what attracted me to Falcon was

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:02.860
the kind of non-opinionated ideas, being able to have like a flexible base that I could build upon

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:09.440
and, you know, reuse over and over almost like a framework for frameworks, if that sort of makes

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:15.480
sense. Yeah. That is interesting. I think there's people who learn web development or do web development

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.980
are kind of in two camps. They either like all this flexibility and like, I'm going to pick this

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.380
ORM or this data access layer and this caching layer. I'm going to plug this together like that.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:31.780
Or they want just, it's kind of slotted together like this style or Django, right?

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:39.480
The interesting thing about Falcon is that it kind of, in some ways, like a lot of frameworks are very,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:45.900
have a very opinionated way of approaching things, which is, you know, both good and bad. I think,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:52.700
Kurt and I like to talk about how Falcon is kind of in the middle of a spectrum of frameworks. You know,

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:58.800
all of them have different and important purposes, but yeah, some, in some cases, it depends on your,

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:06.080
either your own personal opinions or, or the problem you're trying to solve. But in the case of

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:12.880
Falcon, it just seemed like to, to jive with the way that I thought, the way that I approached problems.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.100
And fast forward a couple years later, then became a maintainer. So yeah, that's cool.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.620
Wait a minute. I'm working on, I'm creating this thing. I was just using it. What's going on here?

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.600
How'd I get here?

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.640
Yeah, exactly.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:32.100
So Kurt, what was the original idea behind creating Falcon?

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:37.280
Well, that's an interesting story. So Falcon was actually based on an experimental framework

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:44.900
that I had developed four plus years ago. So at the time my team and I were tasked with building a cloud

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:50.400
backup product for Rackspace. And the way this would work is you would have these headless agents that

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.000
would sit on the cloud servers. They would do the heavy lifting, the backup encryption,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.660
uploading to cloud files, which is Rackspace's version of OpenStack Swift. And you need some way to kind of

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.880
command and control the agent, right? So it needed to be able to talk back to this sort of monolithic

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.840
web application that had the control panel there, had some of the control logic, the settings, you know,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:18.700
what you should back up, et cetera, how often you should do it. So we needed some simple messaging

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.460
mechanism for those two things to talk, the agent and the control plane.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.960
So we started looking at some different ways to do that based on some previous experience.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.700
We were kind of biased towards using the REST architectural style for that messaging service.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:40.260
As I mentioned earlier, so I had played around with Node, JS, but that wasn't really a, it was still pretty new at the

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:45.720
time and not a lot of people were using it at Rackspace. But Python seemed to be more of a natural fit.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:51.220
So I started just kind of looking around, you know, I'm kind of a firm believer in using the best tool for the job.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.780
I just kind of looked at some of the different frameworks. Flask seemed kind of like a natural fit.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.660
It's a little bit lighter weight than Django. Looked like it might be a good way to go.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:06.620
So I just kind of built like a very basic kind of hello world app, like as you do, and just benchmarked it.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:14.120
So the thing with this, we had some very stringent latency requirements, because one of the things that you would do

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:20.580
through the control panel is actually go browse your remote machines, their file systems and choose what you want to back up, right?

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:26.900
And so that message passing had to be semi real time. We wanted it to be as responsive as possible.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:37.420
So I kind of had an idea of a budget of response time. I don't remember exactly. It was certainly under 200 milliseconds, probably more

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.260
120, around there. Ideally, we want to get it down.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.340
Does that count ping time?

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:42.980
Yes, overall.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:53.500
So you need it under 200 milliseconds for it to feel real time. That's just the nature of humans, which means that your app, you don't have much left over for just for your app to turn around the request.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:15:05.680
Honestly, at the end of the day, you have like 40, 30, 20 milliseconds to turn around a request, because a lot of the time is just eaten up with traversing the internet. So yeah, so I didn't have a big budget for the latency there.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:20.760
And I benchmarked just a simple Falcon app. And it was much higher than I expected. I honestly, I don't recall the exact time. But I thought, you know, that's kind of weird. Let me just try just a straight up raw whiskey app.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:41.420
You know, so I looked up the PEP 333 and wrote up just a simple, simple app there that didn't do anything. And there was actually a huge gap between that, you know, the response time there, and just with like a Falcon hello app. And I thought, that's weird. You know, what is Falcon doing? I mean, what is, what is, it's taking so long, right?

00:15:41.820 --> 00:16:05.860
I have to kind of confess a sin here. I used to do a lot of Ruby as well, Ruby on Rails stuff. And I remember this Sinatra framework, right, which is kind of one of the early projects to explore this micro framework concept. So I did the same thing over there. I did a basic, like, just raw rack app. And then I benchmarked Sinatra. And just the difference between those wasn't actually that great.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:23.780
And so I just had the hypothesis that, you know, there's probably stuff that's, I could probably make a thinner framework than Flask that would give me enough, enough to work with it. I don't have to just code directly to the whiskey interface, but it's still, you know, fast enough for my, for my needs.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:33.640
Right. You just need a few abstractions. You need body, you need the verb, you need the headers, and you need JSON serialization or something like that, right?

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:57.960
Exactly. So it just started out very simple, kind of as this experiment, very pragmatic. And I ended up building this little framework, and we put that service into production, and it worked really well for us. And so I decided we probably should make this real. And so we started the Falcon Project, started inviting people from the community to try it out and contribute. And then that's where, that's kind of where it came from.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:06.080
Yeah. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Definitely in the benchmarks, which we'll talk about performance later. It's faster than many of the other sort of well-known frameworks.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:14.540
Yeah, definitely. And kind of going back to what John was saying, it's there when you need it. Not everybody needs it. So it just kind of depends on what your use case is.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:26.000
Yeah, for sure. So John, maybe this is an interesting time to do like a compare and contrast. What's this framework? Like, how is it different and special than let's say Flask, Django, Pyramid, these types of frameworks?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:45.260
Inherently, the more pragmatic approach, I believe, for Falcon is kind of the benefit. But to like what I was saying earlier, a lot of this does tend to be very much of a spectrum and kind of a part of the, you can almost think of the wider community of frameworks.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:18:06.280
The direct benefits. Yes, you've got performance, but sometimes performance is not always the most important thing. I heard someone say once, and I firmly believe this, that in a lot of cases, time to market is more important. So you can have the most performant app in the world. But if you don't get the job done, then...

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.500
We'd all just be optimizing our stuff in assembly and making it go really fast.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.520
Yeah.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:10.820
Yeah.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:21.880
I think, you know, there are some interesting differences. A lot of them do come around the kind of more either heavier or opinionated type, say, almost workflows.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:39.360
The benefit that Falcon has given me personally, and one of the reasons I got very interested into it, is that especially when you're building internal tooling, often cases you need a certain level of flexibility that oftentimes opinionated frameworks don't give you.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:46.460
So, like, they might be great for the top, you know, for like 80% of your work, and then it's a real burden to try to get through.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:58.320
It doesn't mean that those frameworks aren't any, you know, worse or, you know, better. It's just a different tool for the job. So, to like what Kurt was saying, trying to focus on the right tool.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.020
Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:12.020
What we've seen in talking with users is it's really become sort of a complementary framework to what people are doing. You'll have someone who has a large sort of monolithic Django app, and they have a really hot endpoint.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:18.380
Maybe they're using Django REST framework, which is a great framework, but for this one endpoint, it's just killing their servers.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:32.300
So, they carve that piece out, write it in Falcon. It lets them make the performance trade-offs that they want to make, and then, you know, they keep the rest in Django, and then they are able to partition that one piece off into a microservice, and that works well for people.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.160
So, that's just one example of how it works alongside these other frameworks.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:48.240
Yeah, that's a much better answer than saying, let's rewrite it and go. Let's rewrite it and C++. Let's rewrite it and, you know, name your other language and technology that has its own problems, right?

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.660
I think that's something very important to kind of go along with that. A lot of people, they do focus on those initial numbers.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:20:00.320
Those numbers may look great, but, you know, real-world numbers are often much different than benchmark numbers.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:07.640
And at the end of the day, a lot of this, especially in today's world, it's about how you can scale your app after the fact.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.860
Like, you may only have a couple thousand requests a second, you know, out of the gate.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:24.480
But whether or not you can, you've architected your system or your application to be able to scale to 100,000 or a million or whatever, that's usually the most important.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.180
Because in this day and age, hardware is scalable.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.180
Yeah, for sure.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:40.480
And you definitely, you know, the benchmarks, they're often doing something very, very lightweight inside, like reading a value off the query string and returning it back as JSON or something.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:46.900
And I think maybe the way to think of it is more like this is the overhead this framework adds to your app.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.360
But that's not your app.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.120
You know what I mean?

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.860
Like, your app is actually the talking to the database, the logic, this other service it calls, et cetera, et cetera, right?

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.220
Yeah.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:21:05.520
I mean, if you recall the little story I told, I mean, kind of the core idea around Falcon is our promise to you is we will remove the bottleneck in the framework.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.100
Your performance bottleneck will not be in the framework.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.200
Everything outside of that is kind of up to you, right?

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.180
And it depends on all the things you're doing.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.120
That's still your problem, yeah.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:13.360
Yeah.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.140
So, but at least you don't have to worry about that piece.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:16.860
Yeah, it's really cool.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.920
I definitely want to talk a lot about the performance, but a little bit later.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:26.860
Falcon is mostly for building APIs, if I understand it right.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:35.440
Is it possible to build like Jinja 2 or Chameleon-based UI type things, or is it really just focused on APIs?

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.100
You can.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:46.680
I know several of our users have actually asked how to do these types of things, and it's actually not that hard to plug in a Jinja 2 rendering system into,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.300
into your resources for Falcon.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.620
Is it really well designed for that?

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.660
Not really.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.180
You could easily build something around Falcon to do it.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:03.580
Often cases, I think the majority of our use cases are mainly around APIs, but it doesn't mean you couldn't.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.000
Sure.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.420
And I think it's kind of cool to have a framework focused only on APIs, because you know what?

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.800
It's really probably super good at that, right?

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.400
Compared to trying to fit it into all these other models.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.880
One of the things that I was talking with the user, this was quite a ways ago, maybe in December,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:30.240
and they were actually building effectively a little ORM on top of Falcon, just to kind of give you an idea of what the scope of how much somebody was able to change it,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.840
which is, you know, that's awesome that they're able to do that.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.560
I would imagine it would be a little bit more work than what people would often want to do.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:44.860
Maybe another framework is a little bit more well-suited for it, but in their case, they wanted the flexibility and control.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.460
Sure.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.520
Yeah, so probably people that would do that sort of thing are kind of your control freaks, right?

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.300
They want to tweak everything.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.420
Control freaks in the developer space, never.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.640
We're happy to accommodate them.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.940
Yeah, that's cool.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.720
We want to do it.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.880
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Linode.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.920

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.100
Look past that bookstore and check out Linode at talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.100
That's L-I-N-O-D-E.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.040
Plans start at just $5 a month for a dedicated server with a gig of RAM.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:25.220
They have 10 data centers across the globe, so no matter where you are, there's a data center near you.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:30.380
Whether you want to run your Python web app, host a private Git server, or even a file server,

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.660
you'll get native SSDs on all the machines, a 40 gigabit network, 24-7 friendly support,

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.620
even on holidays, and a seven-day money-back guarantee.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.980
Want a dedicated server for free for the next four months?

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:48.460
Use the coupon code python17 at talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:54.100
You guys had said that it's almost like a meta framework in some sense.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:58.640
It's like low enough that you could actually build other frameworks kind of on top of it in a sense.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.920
Does that sort of land in that space, this example?

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.600
Yeah, definitely.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.020
We've seen a couple people do it.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.360
Hug is probably one of the better known frameworks that's actually built on top of Falcon.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:09.940
Interesting.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.280
Hug is built on top of Falcon.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.480
I was going to ask you about Hug and Django REST Framework and API Star.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:23.840
Those three, well, API Star and Hug feel like the newcomers that are also trying to be API-focused only,

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:29.940
whereas Django REST Framework is more extending Django than kind of being a new thing, I think.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:37.120
Yeah, I mean, I think the Django REST Framework is trying to just be an easy on-ramp to APIs when you're already doing your work in Django.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.300
So it's a natural place there.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.380
I think Tom's done some good work with that.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.360
And, you know, you look at Hug, API Star, those sorts of things.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.380
They're trying to kind of ease the burden of API development.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.740
When you kind of do that, you necessarily have to be more opinionated.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:57.580
We've mentioned this earlier, Falcon tries to be a little more low-level, less opinionated.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.960
But you can certainly build these kinds of things on top of it.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.900
Yeah, that's really cool, actually.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.140
And it's interesting to hear about the Hug relationship.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:12.700
So speaking of the philosophy, you had three basic driving points for your philosophy to be light, fast, and explicit, right?

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.160
The light, we've kind of touched on a little bit, being fairly low-level.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:21.520
But there's a couple things that we haven't mentioned, some of the benefits that gives you.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:27.880
One is that you have a smaller code base, so it's easier to make a reliable framework.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:39.560
When something blows up, it's easy, somewhat straightforward to find the problem and fix it quickly, which becomes very important in large-scale deployments.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:46.780
When you're serving many, many thousands of requests, you have hundreds of servers, you need to be able to diagnose problems very quickly.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.780
So that helps as well.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.500
And it also helps just optimize it.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.080
It makes it easier to do that as well.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:54.300
Yeah.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.920
One of the ways to optimize code to make it go really fast is to just not run code.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.080
That's right.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:25:59.340
Right.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.640
This part would be slow.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.080
Let's just not do that in our framework.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:02.880
Do less work.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.540
Yeah.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.900
That's the name of the game.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.160
What else?

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.280
So fast, and we touched on that a bit before as well.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.960
We try to be one of the fastest frameworks.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:18.180
I don't think we necessarily claim to be the fastest framework for all benchmarks in all scenarios,

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.000
but we try to be up there at the top.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.380
And again, make sure that you don't have to worry about, you don't have to spend time looking for the bottleneck in the framework.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:32.740
You are in control of making those performance tradeoffs outside of that piece.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.380
Yeah, for sure.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.340
And the third was explicit, right?

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.660
Like, keep the magic out.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:43.440
You can do a lot of clever things with thread local storage and inversion of control and things like that.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:55.680
I mean, we do a little bit of IOC, but we try to make it painfully obvious, like, where the data is coming from, where it's going, how to set the data, all those sorts of things.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:04.600
Because again, especially in large-scale deployments, when you're trying to debug an issue, you don't want it to be doing something surprising.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.820
The more obvious, the better there.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:15.580
So kind of the opposite of Ruby on Rails or these other frameworks that have lots of conventions and stuff just happening, you kind of got to know it, right?

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.860
Like anything, there's a tradeoff.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:23.000
Like, you get a lot of power from that, but there is kind of a lot of magic and kind of a steep learning curve there.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.640
Sure. So, John, what do you guys do for, like, reliability and testing?

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.420
Do you have, like, continuous integration set up, things like that?

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.320
We do all of our testing via Travis at the moment.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.680
Well, everything except for, I would say, our performance benchmark testing.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:46.160
But we actually, we test against all of the major versions of Python at the moment.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.880
And that would be currently all the way from 2.6 to 3.6 at the moment.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.440
Yeah, that's great. That's quite the span.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:59.140
We also, we do claim support for the both versions of PyPy.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:05.960
And we had a Jython job in there, but I think we were running into a few problems with the Jython.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:15.260
But beyond that, we actually, we mentioned Hug earlier, and we do have, like, an integration test with them, which is very helpful.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:21.520
So, I think we do run quite a few automated tests against Falcon.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:27.760
And we try to make sure and maintain backwards compatibility at all costs.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:33.120
Yeah, that's something I really think is highly important in the web space.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:40.060
Because you see a new update come out, you pip install, upgrade, push that to the server.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:44.100
If that breaks something, that's, you don't want to be caught out.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.080
Why is the website down? Oh, my gosh, this is really upsetting.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.280
Just a quick thought on that.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:57.620
Like, one of the, this kind of came about because in some of our extremely high-scale cloud services that we build at Rackspace,

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:06.120
we were relying on some web frameworks that would tend to break in subtle ways, you know, just in minor version releases.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:11.780
So, we felt that pain very keenly, and we wanted to be very careful about that.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.820
So, that's kind of core to our change management philosophy around Falcon,

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:21.420
that we go to great lengths not to break stuff without a major version rev.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.200
Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.440
John, it seems like the philosophy ties into that as well.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:31.720
Like, the less code you have, the more lightweight, the more explicit, the easier it is to test and not break things.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.180
Definitely.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:41.760
And even when we do add in more substantial features, like, we have a feature coming in for 1.3 around media content type handling.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.660
So, it'll handle serialization, deserialization, all of that.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.320
But all of that is 100% optional.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:59.260
And it's very important that it is that way and that it does not impact, you know, request times from a performance perspective.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:12.520
And, like, we go to great lengths to make sure that things are architected in a way that somebody can feel comfortable just upgrading to the next minor version and not worry about breakages.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.440
Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.520
I think that's great.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.720
And unless you turn on that feature, it's not going to affect you, right?

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.360
Or in this case, it's there.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.260
It's just you have to start using it.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:22.520
Right.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.740
But it's how the feature was designed so that, you know, it doesn't impact you unless you use it.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.960
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.500
So, Kurt, I have a challenge for you.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.600
It's a little bit difficult to describe code in an audio format.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.700
So, don't go too much into detail.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.300
But give us a sense of what it's like to program for this.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:49.620
Like, if I want an API that exposes, like, customers or whatever, I can get a customer and create a customer.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.800
Like, what does the code that I put together to do that look like?

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.680
I typically start out thinking, because I'm kind of a REST geek.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.360
So, I start thinking about the resources.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:05.180
So, I'll think about, okay, we need to define a customer, a resource that represents a customer.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.360
And then maybe a resource that represents a list of those customers.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.580
We'll just think about that.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.760
So, in Falcon, you represent a resource with just a plain Python class.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:20.300
Nothing super special about it, except that in that class, you have what we call responder methods.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.860
And these are just methods that have a well-known name.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:30.080
It starts with on and then underscore and then the name of the HTTP method that you want to respond to.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.680
So, this resource responds to get requests, post requests, etc.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.620
So, you create a method for each one of those.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:42.200
Within that method, in that class, you'll receive request and response objects.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:48.840
And so, this isn't too dissimilar from, like, maybe a web ob sort of a workflow where you get requests and response objects that you deal with.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.460
It is a little bit different in that we hand you a response object.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.320
So, you're not constructing it yourself and returning it.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.420
You, like, fill it out.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:56.780
Yeah.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:02.100
So, like in Flask, you'll say, you know, you'll instantiate some kind of response and return it.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:10.560
We'll pass in a pre-instantiated response, which actually saves you some work for the use cases that Falcon is designed for.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:17.800
You're typically not returning different types of responses for different types of, like, say, JSON versus HTML.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.060
Your negotiation is done a little bit differently.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.500
But, so, you pull the information you need out of the request, do what you need to do.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:32.760
You may use, like, SQLAlchemy to go talk to the backend, pull out a response, and then you fill out HTTP.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.500
You've got the status code.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.400
You've got the headers, things like that.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:42.740
And because this is a class and you instantiate it up front, you can pass in, like, a database connection or whatever, anything like that.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.560
There's no magic thread storage or anything like that.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:52.820
Yeah, that makes testing super easy because it shows you right where to pass in the mock stuff later or other test fake things.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:57.520
So, it's just straight up kind of normal Python class instantiation.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.780
So, once you have that filled out, then you need to wire that up to a route.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:08.920
So, a route is simply a mapping between a URL and your resource.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.360
So, you'll have a place in your code.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:21.440
You probably have a setup file that goes through and instantiates your resource class, passes in the database connection, whatever you need to do there.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:27.400
And then you instantiate an API object, which is a whiskey app.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:34.820
And then on that object, you can call, like, .add route, and you pass in the URL you want and then the resource.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:40.840
And something else that's a little bit different is that from some of the other frameworks is that we don't use decorators.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.000
We have you in stench.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.380
You set up the routes in a central location.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.920
Part of that is philosophical.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.520
I mean, we talk about Python being somewhat unopinionated.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.420
But in a few places, we are a little opinionated.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:34:02.900
We just find that having everything in one spot makes it easier to kind of reason about your API namespace versus having it sprinkled around with decorators all over.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.160
But that's just a little bit of a philosophical difference.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.880
Yeah, I got to say, I kind of like that as well.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.920
Like, you can go to one place near the app startup and go, okay, these are the routes.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.320
This is where they go.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.820
It makes a lot of sense.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.240
And it just makes things a little easier.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.920
Again, it's very clear where things are coming from, where they're going.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.000
Because decorators can be a little bit.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.400
I love decorators.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.460
We use them for some things.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.040
But sometimes they can be a little magical.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:33.580
Probably the other thing to point out here is that you don't specify what verbs you're mapping to that URL.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:39.880
So we are a little bit opinionated around encouraging the REST architectural style, which means you kind of think about resources.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:46.560
And each resource is kind of responsible for deciding what methods it's going to respond to.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:52.140
And so if you don't implement a method, Falcon will just return a method not found for you.

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.420
And it's as simple as that.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:53.820
Right.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:54.920
Okay.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.000
Interesting.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.180
So I might say in my example, slash users, users, customers, slash users, let's say.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:06.000
And then that maps to a user resource class.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.460
And there might be an on get and an on post, but no on patch.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:15.320
And so would patch come back as 404 or a different status code?

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.660
It would come back as a method not found.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.560
So you found the resource.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:25.840
You had like something exists at the other end of that URI.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.840
It just doesn't support the method that you requested.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.260
Right.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:29.700
I see.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:40.360
So this is, again, this kind of goes back to the spirit of HTTP and REST and kind of a, we've read probably way too many RFCs.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.300
And so some of that comes out through some of our design choices.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.180
Is there a place I can make a return a teapot?

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.460
Yes, actually.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:53.780
We have, just for the heck of it, I don't, you know, a couple of years back, we implemented a bunch of 700 errors just for fun.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.060
So they're in there.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.440
Hey, everyone.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:57.860
This is Michael.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.240
Let me tell you about Datadog.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.400
They're sponsoring this episode.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.400
Performance and bottlenecks don't exist just in your application code.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.220
Modern applications are systems built upon systems.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.420
And Datadog lets you view the system as a whole.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.780
Let's say you have a Python web app running Flask.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:18.040
It's built upon MongoDB and hosted and scaled out on a set of Ubuntu servers running Nginx and Microwisgi.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:23.080
Add Datadog and you can view and monitor and even get alerts across all of these systems.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.020
Datadog has a great getting started tutorial that takes just a few moments.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.520
And if you complete it, they'll send you a sweet Datadog t-shirt for free.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.460
Don't hesitate.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.580
Visit talkpython.fm/Datadog and see what you've been missing.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.220
That's talkpython.fm/Datadog.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.660
John, there's a bunch of different add-ons and templates.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.280
So like the philosophy of having it very small and very compact is cool.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.340
But then a bunch of people have created like add-on extensions for this, right?

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:49.700
Yeah.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.160
Yeah.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.060
You want to highlight some of those?

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:51.620
Definitely.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:37:12.860
So there's the interesting thing about the community and kind of how some of the add-ons occur is that a lot of this comes out of a desire for, in some cases, for people's needs or someone has a specific, let's say they're trying to deal with authorization or serialization.

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:19.860
Or they have some very opinionated way of deciding, you know, how to deal with specifications or whatever the case may be.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:25.880
Falcon does allow for a lot of flexibility and control around those kinds of things.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.560
So you can easily extend or wrap aspects of Falcon.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:41.940
One of the interesting things that we did discover, you know, through the number of people who were writing effectively serialization and validation add-ons for Falcon,

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:52.700
we ended up taking a lot of that community feedback and, you know, compiling that into the features that, you know, the media content type handling that's going to be coming in one or three.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.100
Right.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.720
That's the thing you guys were just talking about.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.000
Yeah.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.780
That like content negotiation stuff that you were just talking about.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.020
Yeah.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:04.340
So like there's a lot of frameworks have very opinionated ways of looking at it.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:09.680
Myself, like I've used quite a few different methods depending on the needs.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:16.660
And, you know, for whether it be, you know, EMC, Rackspace, personal projects, whatever it may be,

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:21.880
you know, everyone has a little bit different ways of handling data or validating it.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:30.420
And so trying to find a uniform and generic enough approach for everyone took quite a long time.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:37.040
But some of that didn't occur until a lot of our community members started writing their own implementations.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.400
So it's very cool to see kind of how that evolved from that.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:47.560
You know, it started as an add-on and now it's become something that's going to be baked into the framework and the next release.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.880
So you had like five or six examples of people trying to solve the problem.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.860
You're like, I think we can put it all together like this, huh?

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.180
Yeah.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.060
Most definitely.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:39:02.780
We try to, you know, we're trying to be careful because we want to leave space for people to go and innovate and do these sort of third-party add-ons.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.380
And we don't want to be too opinionated.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:09.900
But in cases like these where we've seen a lot of, you know, it's pretty much something everybody needs.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:17.160
We're moving towards a place where we think we're going to start creating some basic, just a basic way to get started out of the box.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:23.600
And completely optional and still allow room for other people to build more sophisticated solutions.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.100
But just to give somebody, people something to get started with.

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:26.880
Yeah, of course.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:32.500
So are you thinking these are like extra packages that you can pull in?

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.180
Or are they going straight into Falcon, the package?

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.500
There are all, I believe all of these are usually directly on PyPI.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:47.400
Some people have like just avoided that step and they just build them into their almost pseudo frameworks.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.440
That's it on top.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:57.940
I know for several smaller projects that I've done, I've had a very specific problem and I built middleware to solve the problem.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.080
And they were never, it was never upstreamed or anything like that.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.920
But it was great to solve the problem for the business need and it was carried around.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.360
But there's no sense in upstreaming a lot of that.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:19.440
So, but I think most of our contributors have just pushed up a PyPI package with that starts with like Falcon dash and then whatever, whatever they wanted it to be.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:19.660
Yep.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.060
Yeah.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:20.740
That makes sense.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.980
Falcon Forbes is a great example, a common use case, right?

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.380
For APIs, being able to access them from like single page apps and things.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:35.400
And so we had someone who's contributed a few patches to Python say, hey, should I just build this out and should we make it part of the framework or not?

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.680
And he just ended up kind of maintaining it separately.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.320
And I think that's great.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.500
You know, I think that's kind of what open source community is all about.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:56.260
For the stuff that we pull in, I think one of the deciding factors for us is what dependencies it brings with it because we don't want to like force extra stuff on the operators if we don't, that they have to kind of manage.

00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:01.760
And also the more dependencies you bring in, the more likelihood that they might cause bugs or problems.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.020
So we try to keep our dependency list super short.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:17.480
So if it's something like JSON, like the built-in media handling helpers that John was talking about that are going to be in the next release, like, you know, they just use the standard library JSON.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:17.900
Yeah.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.400
So they don't bring much baggage with them.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.800
And it's very basic stuff.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.240
So it doesn't bring a lot of baggage with it.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.620
You know, you start looking at some other things, it starts to be kind of heavy pretty quickly.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:34.580
So we might, you know, we're kind of exploring our options, trying to still kind of experiment with how we want to do this.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:40.960
I think over time we'll probably have a few projects under the falconry work that we maintain.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:47.540
But we want to make sure we don't stomp on anybody's efforts to kind of do something really interesting out there in the community.

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:47.860
Sure.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.100
Yeah.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:56.660
Maybe have like some cookie cutter template type things that will bring in these additional libraries and like make it easy to get started, but not make it part of the project itself.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:57.660
People don't want them.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:58.080
Definitely.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.740
We've actually talked about that a bit.

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.320
And I know I've been playing with a few things on the side.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.940
I haven't actually pushed up anything yet.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:17.280
But we've had several discussions, especially since PyCon, around how we can make that adoption and like building of projects a little bit easier on the community.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:24.140
And so hopefully we'll have a better answer around that, you know, in a bit.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:24.460
Yeah.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.000
Sounds good.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.100
So, John, let's talk about hosting.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.100
You can run falcon, obviously, on CPython.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:36.020
As far back as 2.6 and as far forward as 3.6.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.040
So that's really great.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.660
It also runs on PyPy, right?

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.380
It does.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:45.660
Both PyPy, you know, to, I guess, PyPy 2 and PyPy 3.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:56.180
From like a, how Falcon can be deployed is a very interesting, in a lot of cases, it just kind of comes down to what your needs are.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:05.700
Because some people, like there are still performance differences between 2.7 and 3.5, 3.6, 3.7.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.280
A lot of those performance differences in Python have started dwindling.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.580
But there are still differences, especially with PyPy 3.0.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.760
There's still some performance disadvantages.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:25.140
So like if you needed top performance for whatever you're doing, maybe it's not quite there or ready for you yet.

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:37.020
In a lot of cases, while I generally deploy with PyPy, a lot of people that I, you know, talk with, they're more than happy with 3.5 or 3.6.

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:37.420
Right.

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.260
Straight CPython 3.5 or 3.6.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:39.720
Yeah.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.400
Yeah.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:49.380
And I guess that comes back to the, like, how much of it is the framework that you're worried about versus how much of it is your internal code and the stuff you're doing internally?

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:56.760
How much can it leverage the speedups of PyPy versus does that thing you're using have some kind of C speedups anyway?

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.060
And so it would lose those or whatever, right?

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:06.120
A lot of the performance problems that we see are not necessarily in the Python directly.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.180
I mean, there's a lot of speed advantages you can get by using PyPy.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.540
And I highly recommend people using it.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:19.620
One of the difficulties that we see, especially in recent times, is dealing with the WSGI servers themselves.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:28.560
And I know this is something that really came up over in discussions at PyCon between the Django REST framework.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.960
So that'd be Tom Christie, Falcon, and Flask.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:36.540
And we were all talking about how to deal with some of the bottlenecks we see in the WSGI servers.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.640
Like, I personally do play with G Unicorn, and I think it's great.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:45.580
But there are certain bottlenecks in the WSGI servers currently.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.580
And, yeah.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:53.320
It does, like, you can sometimes squeeze out more performance out of using, like, UWSGI or MicroWSGI.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.540
But, yeah.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.200
We run into quite a few problems right now on that.

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:04.220
Well, and then there's the whole async side of the story that doesn't even fit with WSGI or the HTTP2 thing.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.760
And there's a lot of room for those to get better.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.480
Most definitely.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:18.140
And that's actually what Tom Christie from Django REST framework and API Star, like, that's a lot of the work that, you know, he's exploring right now.

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:30.900
And Uveacorn is to try to deal with this kind of compatibility between async and G Unicorn and trying to resolve some of these WSGI-ish philosophies.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.120
So it's very fascinating.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:37.700
I imagine that the story around this will radically change in the next year, which makes me very excited.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.460
Yeah, me too.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.880
I think it's definitely a place where there's a lot of flowers blooming.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.140
And somebody's going to crack this problem, and we'll just agree on it.

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.880
And it'll be like WSGI.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.700
Of course you use that.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:54.700
What I really like about Tom's approach is kind of up to this point, a lot of the attempts to crack this have been monolithic.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:46:00.500
Like, someone will have a web framework, but then they'll build in, you know, an async web server.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:05.200
And it's kind of hard to just use their web server, and it's fairly opinionated.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:15.180
But building an async worker type for G Unicorn, exploring sort of a way of creating a de facto interface for that.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.680
Nobody's really interested in doing like a WSGI 2.0.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:25.100
But, you know, we need something to kind of code against so people stop implementing it every 10 different ways.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.060
That's right.

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.960
So, yeah, we're following his work closely.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.660
I'm hoping to contribute once we get a little bit more time here.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.780
And we'll kind of see how it goes.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:33.720
Yeah, that'd be great.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.920
It'd be really cool to see something come out of that.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:45.220
So, another thing around this performance and ways to host and run and work with Falcon is you guys also do something interesting with Cython, right, Kurt?

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.700
Interesting thing with Cython.

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:56.820
Cython, if you're not kind of familiar with it, it translates your Python code to CPython code and then compiles it for you just kind of automagically.

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:06.320
And if you want, you can add additional annotations to your Python code that will basically give hints to Cython.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:12.680
So, you can say, hey, this is an int or treat this as an actual array and it's going to be a fixed size or things like that.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.640
And then that allows Cython to do even more optimizations on it.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.540
But you can simply compile any Python code.

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.460
You can run it through Cython.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:30.220
It'll compile it for you and you get just the measurements I've seen in around 10, 20% decrease in your CPU cycles just by doing that.

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:30.600
That's cool.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:36.520
And that's not compiling your code running on Falcon, but compiling Falcon itself once you've installed it, right?

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.280
That's right.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:42.440
So, in the setup.py file, it just detects Cython if you've installed it.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.280
So, it's an optional dependency.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:51.200
If it's there, then it'll just use the build extension from Cython to pull in all the Falcons.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.780
You could certainly do the exact same thing with your own code.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.600
It's not terribly difficult.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:04.300
It's kind of a nice, easy way to get a little bit of an extra performance boost if you are sort of invested in CPython.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.020
If you can move to PyPy, then you'll see a much greater increase.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.980
But not everybody can do that.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:10.320
Right.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:15.120
That probably depends somewhat on, yeah, it depends on the libraries that runs inside your methods.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:15.660
Yeah.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.240
Cool.

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.020
So, while we're on the topic, let's talk about performance.

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.200
You guys have some benchmark numbers that you put up there.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:27.120
And I just, I can feel the challenges every time I see benchmark numbers.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.660
Well, people shooting arrows at it.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.780
No, you didn't do it this way, but I did it that way.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.100
If I do it this way, it's faster.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:35.000
Yeah.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Yeah.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.060
It's just, but I still feel like they're kind of important to give you a general sense.

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.000
Right?

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.280
Mm-hmm.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:50.160
So, on like CPython, you have, let's see, you've got Flask coming in around 4,200 for this particular benchmark.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.860
You lay out the details on the website.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.980
Like 4,200 requests a second.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:00.160
You've got Bottle going at 16,000, but Bottle's like a super micro framework.

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:04.740
And then Falcon coming in at 30,000, which is really nice.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:09.460
So, sort of use Pecan as a baseline, and it's 28 times faster than that.

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:09.960
So, that's cool.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.020
Pecan was one of the frameworks that we were looking at for developing some services earlier on.

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:15.900
So, it just happened to end up in the benchmarks.

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.600
And we probably need to add Django.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:25.460
It's a fairly straightforward benchmark just to show you what's possible, really.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:25.860
Right.

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:30.720
How much of a difference it can make to kind of remove some of the layers and the abstractions.

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:40.800
And you may end up not needing, you know, some people are, a lot of people are kind of moving to Go or looking at some other, or Node, looking at some other options.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.080
But you may not need to.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.060
Maybe you just need to use something a little bit lighter.

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:49.340
But we try to be very, very straightforward about what this is and how we've done it.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:52.980
But you certainly need to go benchmark your own use cases.

00:49:52.980 --> 00:50:05.920
I mean, for that messaging service that we use for cloud backup I mentioned earlier, I went and built out an almost full implementation in Node and in Python and benchmark both of them to see which would do better for us.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.120
So, yeah, you've got to do your own homework.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:11.460
But this gives you a rough feeling for what's possible.

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:12.580
Yeah, that's very cool.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:25.500
I was going to say, in addition to that, one of the things that is often kind of missed as a part of the benchmarks that we do is that we do remove the WSGI server from the benchmark.

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:32.480
A lot of for the reasons why I was mentioning earlier around the performance constraints that occur in the WSGI server.

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:42.400
So that's where we really encourage people to focus on what their use case will actually be, because that's really the numbers that will, at the end of the day, matter.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:46.880
So you can do great things, and they can be extremely fast.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:51:00.160
It just really depends on your configuration and your use case, because the benchmarks that we ended up doing were primarily to illustrate overhead within the framework themselves.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:11.620
And, you know, to show that kind of, this is where we sit from a, how much load the framework has on the entire process.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:14.620
So the theoretical maximum currently.

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:15.380
Right, yeah.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.840
If you did nothing, you could maybe get this.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:24.100
Yeah, and it's also worth pointing out the PyPy one, where, as I said, the CPython one was at 30,000 requests a second.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.160
The PyPy one is 345,346.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:31.100
So that's a really dramatic increase.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:39.560
One of the things I know, I've definitely used PyPy quite a bit in more larger scale caching services.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:50.420
And the higher performance nature of running Falcon under PyPy has really saved, you know, saved the situation, so to speak.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.300
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:56.160
Another piece of advice you guys have is to use, is it micro JSON, UJSON?

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:02.060
If you're using CPython, because it'll speed up the serialization and query string parsing and stuff.

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:10.900
But skip it on PyPy, because otherwise it'll have to fall back to c types, because micro JSON, I'm guessing, is partially implemented in c.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:15.500
PyPy has been historically at a bit of a disadvantage when it comes to c types.

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.840
And they've been getting a lot better at that, so we'll see where that goes.

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:24.360
But if you're using Python CFFI, it works a little bit better, better optimized for that case.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.300
This just kind of goes back to the tradeoffs, right?

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:33.440
I mean, there are a lot of nice kind of drop-in replacement libraries you can use that are highly optimized.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.740
But make sure you go and look at actually how they're implemented.

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:42.040
They may be faster on CPython, but slower on PyPy.

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.640
Yep. Measure, don't guess, huh?

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:43.960
Yep.

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.140
John, how about some notable users or deployments?

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:46.860
Yeah.

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:52.120
So there are, we've got quite a few people from various organizations.

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:57.980
You know, people from, you know, LinkedIn, they have a few open source projects that use us.

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.340
EMZ, obviously, since I was there.

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.560
OpenStack.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:09.280
Wargaming, which for people who are in the gaming world, I believe they do use us for certain aspects of World of Tanks.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.020
Oh, that's cool.

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.120
Rackspace, obviously.

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:19.420
In fact, I think there's a talk that was done by some of the warm gaming people in Russia over some of their usage.

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:21.160
Yeah, we've got a lot of people.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:26.260
I think last time we checked, we get it for stats are a good thing.

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:33.080
And I think we get around 50,000 something downloads per month with PyPy.

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.060
That's awesome.

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:36.760
A lot of people using it in various circumstances.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.980
I guess you...

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:39.480
A lot of people using it for internal things.

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.740
Yeah, they're not going to talk about it probably.

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:42.060
Yeah.

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:44.760
There's also everyone using Hug in a sense, right?

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.560
I guess.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:56.820
That's actually one of the kind of very interesting things about Falcon and his current position of having someone like Timothy coming along and building a framework on top of us.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:01.180
We don't necessarily get the advantages from a download perspective.

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:06.940
But we get users by proxy almost, which is very interesting.

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:11.700
Yeah, and probably improvements made at your level by way of that framework also help you.

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:21.140
Definitely trying to understand some of the use cases that occur in a framework like Hug definitely help kind of inform some of our decisions.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.040
It helps us...

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:27.060
It almost helps keep us honest going back to the whole continuous integration.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:33.100
It's great to have almost like a classic use case that we can test against.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.060
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.640
All right, gentlemen.

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.860
I think that is all the time we have to talk about Falcon.

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:42.240
But let me ask you the two questions I always ask at the end.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.520
And Kurt, I guess I'll start with you.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.620
Favorite editor, if you want to write some Python code, what do you open up?

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:48.720
So I live and breathe in Sublime.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.040
It's kind of my working horse editor.

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:54.680
So I used to, years ago, I used to be more of an IDE guy.

00:54:54.680 --> 00:55:01.740
But I've kind of taken the pragmatic programmer's advice to heart and tried to find something I can use that's a little more versatile.

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.920
I can kind of use for everything.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.080
And then I don't have to context switch with my brain.

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.540
Yeah, makes sense.

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:11.700
So it's a nice mixture between having access to a lot of keyboard shortcuts and whatnot.

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:16.100
But I can also kind of use my mouse for certain things that are more efficient that way.

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:16.320
Sure.

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:16.820
John?

00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:17.440
NeoVim.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.120
I am one of those Vim people.

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:19.900
All right.

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:20.220
Awesome.

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.760
And notable PyPI package.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.520
What do you guys want to recommend?

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.080
Kurt, go with you first.

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:27.640
Oh, sorry.

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.100
Go ahead, John.

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.980
One of the ones I like to recommend is the testing.libraries.

00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:40.280
A lot of people, they talk about having to mock up database interactions or, you know, when they're trying to test their API.

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:50.320
Whenever there's a Python package that will actually, on demand, set up a local instance of like Postgres or Redis or MySQL.

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:53.960
And then tear it down as a part of your tests.

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:59.040
And you can eliminate a lot of testing burden just through those packages.

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.600
So I'm a big fan of them.

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:06.700
Yeah, that's really cool because sometimes mocking out the data layer is just like so much work for that tradeoff, you know?

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:07.280
It is.

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.660
And you also need to test your migration.

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.340
So it's great for that.

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:10.960
Yeah, cool.

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.620
We mentioned UVicorn a few times.

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.480
That's Tom Christie's kind of new baby.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.920
And he's doing some impressive work over there.

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.620
So I invite everyone to check that out.

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:26.240
He uses the MagicStack HTTP parser and AsyncIO drop-in.

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:29.220
Some pretty impressive performance numbers out of that.

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.480
Some interesting work.

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.400
So check that out.

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:31.840
Yeah, it's cool.

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.480
It's based on UVloop as well, right?

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.200
Yes.

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:34.600
Yep.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.520
And probably just another one.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:40.280
I want to give a shout out to Brian Warner's Magic Wormhole project.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:43.720
I think he gave a talk at it a couple years back at PyCon.

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:51.920
But it's just a really clever, easy way to securely ship files from point A to point B to send something to a friend.

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:58.380
It's like on-demand Dropbox from the command line with a one-time code thing.

00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:58.820
Yeah.

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:04.360
I mean, whether or not you even care about the security, it's just a really slick way to ship files.

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.160
So check that out.

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:05.440
All right.

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:05.620
Yeah.

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.720
Good recommendations, you guys.

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:08.020
Very nice projects.

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.260
All right.

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:10.100
Final call to action.

00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.560
People want to get started.

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.380
What do they do?

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.880
Go check out falconframework.org.

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:22.140
It just gives you a quick overview of the project, has links to GitHub, has links to our Gitter channel.

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.900
We have a couple channels there.

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:28.140
There's a user channel for just getting started, asking questions.

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.440
We have a dev channel for contributors.

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:32.900
And, you know, check that out.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:38.380
Once you get playing with the framework, if you run into any issues, reach out to us.

00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.000
We're always happy to help.

00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:42.600
And we're always looking for contributors, certainly.

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:46.560
So of all levels, we're happy to help you get started there as well.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:46.920
All right.

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.340
That's great.

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.700
Yeah, definitely a cool project to get involved with.

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:53.700
A lot of people ask about what open source project they might get a chance to, you know,

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.180
they want to do their first open source thing.

00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:56.600
This would be a fun one.

00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:01.120
If you're interested in kind of learning the fundamentals of the HTTP protocol,

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:06.100
which is a surprisingly complex protocol, you know, it's a good way to kind of get under the hood

00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:07.100
and see how it all works.

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:07.380
Yep.

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:08.480
Sounds great.

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.740
Thank you guys for being on the show.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.740
This project is really, really interesting.

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.480
I'm glad to see it being successful.

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:13.920
Awesome.

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.780
Thank you.

00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:15.200
Thanks a lot.

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:19.500

I really appreciate it.

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.320
Now get out there and write some Python code.

00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:52.880
I really appreciate it.
