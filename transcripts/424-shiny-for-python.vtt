00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:06.660
If you want to share your data science results as interactive web apps, you could learn Flask or Django and a bunch of other web technologies.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.420
Or you could pick up one of the powerful frameworks for deploying data science specifically.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.480
And if you're searching through that space, you're likely to hear about Shiny.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.440
But that's just for the R side of data science, right?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.940
Not any longer.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.680
Joe Chen is here to introduce us to the recently released Shiny for Python.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.300
And it looks like a really solid new framework on the block.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.060
This is Talk Python To Me, episode 424, recorded June 19th, 2023.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:50.300

Hey, Joe.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.140
Welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.820
Hi, Michael.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.680
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.320
It's a pleasure to have you here.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.680
We're talking Python to an R person.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.560
What's going on here?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.620
What is happening?

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.820
I know, right?

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.020
Cats and dogs living together.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.100
Oh, my gosh.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.680
No, it's great.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.400
Glad to have you here.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.420
Yeah, thanks.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:26.660
So we're going to talk about Shiny, which has traditionally been UI framework, a web framework for kind of rad rapid development for R applications that need some interactivity.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.760
But you have a big release for the Python people.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.440
That's also interesting and worth talking about.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.500
So that's the topic of today's show.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.480
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.000
I hope you starting out mentioning R that people haven't dropped off already.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.960
I promise we'll have lots to say about Python and Shiny for Python.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.020
Of course, I'm sure.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.880
Shiny for Python is going to be super fun.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.780
Before we get to that, though, let's get started with your story.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.240
How did you get into programming R and then what brought you over to Python, at least temporarily or partially?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.720
Yeah, my background was in web programming really more than anything else.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.900
I got into programming actually through desktop publishing and graphic design.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.600
That was what I was really excited about.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.460
And in college, that turned into web design.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.060
I went to college from 1996 through 2000.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.420
So that the height of the dot com sort of craziness.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.580
And I just found myself.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.620
CD Baby and all that stuff.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.940
Oh, yeah.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.380
Absolutely.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.460
Pets.com.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.080
Oh, yeah.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.320
Pets.com.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.820
That's right.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.160
And I just found myself sort of pulled into just all the cool things that we could do on the web.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.980
And went from sort of front end web development, which meant something very different back then than it does today.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.180
I mean, HTML, right?

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.840
HTML.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.620
Yep.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.040
Basically, string interpolation as a career.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.920
That was what I was all about.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.820
And that sort of led me into really falling in love with programming as a discipline.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.880
And I got more into the back end, more into sort of closer and closer to the systems level programming.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:05.620
And I just really enjoyed being sort of full stack, both on the website and even spent a few years doing Windows desktop programming, just to kind of see what that world was like.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:18.820
And one of the things that I like, one of the best things that happened to me early in my career was hooking up with JJ Allaire, who's the founder of our studio and the founder of two other companies that I worked for previous to that in Boston.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:28.560
And I kind of got to the point in my career where I was more interested in the people I was working with than the technologies or even the idea.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.340
I knew I liked startups and I knew I liked working for JJ and the people that he had around him.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.320
And he got excited about R.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.940
I think his friend who was like a high school science teacher somehow got turned on to R.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.400
And JJ was fascinated by the fact that this is in 2008 or 2009.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:05:05.560
There was this GPL licensed platform for doing what traditionally people would do in very proprietary platforms like all these statistics packages that you might have been forced to learn in college, you know, back in the 2000s.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.120
And here was this pretty rough, pretty raw, but all the pieces were there kind of platform for doing all this stuff with code.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.820
And he immediately saw something and I definitely saw nothing.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:24.900
But I believed in JJ and I he had the idea to build an IDE in a web browser for this R language.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:32.640
And I was like, I don't see the chain and thinking that leads you to think that this is a good idea, but also sounds super fun.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.760
And I would love to see if it's possible to build an IDE for the web.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.120
And so in the beginning, really, I was in R completely by accident.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.940
And I didn't even really learn much R as I was building, helping to build the RStudio IDE.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.700
That's kind of the irony of those types of platforms, right?

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.520
100%.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.940
When I talk to people about Jupyter Notebooks, they're enabling Python people, but they're writing TypeScript.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.380
That's exactly right.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.860
That's right.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.760
What's the story for RStudio's side?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.640
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.320
Oh, it's a crazy story technology wise.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.640
Well, the part that's not crazy, the sort of hardcore server bits are written in C++.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:17.240
But the front end, the front end is written in Java, which is then transpiled to JavaScript using a package called Google Web Toolkit.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.680
Oh, yeah.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.280
Okay, sure.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.840
Oh, okay.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.120
So you've heard of GWT.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.840
I haven't written anything with it, but yeah, I know it.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.000
Sure.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.440
Yeah.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.680
I mean, in a world before TypeScript and before React, this really was a godsend.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:37.460
Like to be able to have static typing and the right sort of abstractions to be able to really build large scale.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.820
I mean, RStudio is a giant piece of software, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.520
And I think the very best JavaScript developers can write code bases at large of pure JavaScript, but not me.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.620
Like I definitely needed the crutch of, you know, static type checking.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.200
And anyway, working on RStudio ID was a blast.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.740
And the best thing about it was I got to meet so many data scientists.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.820
And at the time, we call them statisticians.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.100
Now they call data scientists.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.320
But learning what they do, what the problems they were solving was so interesting.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.200
And that eventually led to Shiny.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:18.820
And that's when I really started getting serious about actually writing R code in my day to day, which was a fascinating journey in and of itself.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.140
Yeah.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.820
Well, I would say that your faith was well placed, right?

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.860
Even if you're like, I'm not sure about this RStudio thing.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.800
I think it's, I think some people have heard of it.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.120
Yeah.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.680
Yeah.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.400
It really has been such an incredible, such incredible ride.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:39.660
And there were many steps along the way where I was like, this does not really make a ton of sense to me.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:47.520
But JJ has proven out time and time again that things that he cares about, it turns out that there are other people that care about it.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.360
So he was really super into reproducible research before it was on everybody's lips.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.240
And he really spent a lot of time trying to make that world better for R.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.000
And by then I'd certainly learned to sort of trust in his instincts.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.700
And, you know, just time after time, there have been many bets like that that have paid off really well.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:16.080
It must have been pretty gratifying to work on this project and then talk to these data scientists and say, you know, here, oh, we're doing this work at the Large Hadron Collider.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.720
Or we're doing this work to solve cancer.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.440
And let me, you got to, can you help me with this?

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.860
I'm trying to like work on this protein folding or, you know, something like that, right?

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.220
Yeah.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.500
Probably with some really cool experiences you had like that.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.200
100%.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:29.360
Yeah.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:39.300
I think the first time I ever demoed Shiny in particular at a user group meeting and I was super nervous and went a little overboard on having like lots of demos.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:50.780
And one of them, this is back in 2012, was charting the spread of AIDS throughout the world and showing the sort of levels rise and fall as time went on.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:57.760
And it was interesting at the time because AIDS was sort of receding as education and drugs were getting better.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.540
Except in South Africa, it was getting much, much worse before finally starting to get better because, well, because of many reasons.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:16.320
And so I showed this demo and then afterwards, a friend of mine who I didn't know what he worked on, I just knew him through these user group meetings, came up and said, oh yeah, I'm working at, I think he was at Fred Hutch at the time, working on, you know, an AIDS vaccine.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:26.020
And we're using Shiny to basically be the bridge between the biostatisticians and the biologists and looking at the results of these, you know, assays or whatever it was that they were analyzing.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.620
And that was just blew me away.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:37.000
And absolutely, every conference I go to, you know, many times a year between then and now, I've just been humbled by the kind of things that people are doing with Shiny.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.100
You know, I can really, I hear some stories like that as well.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.660
And I imagine it's just 10x when you're building developer tools like that.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.460
So how about now?

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.720
What are you doing day to day?

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.220
Yeah.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.520
Well, my title is CTO.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:56.900
That is an honorary title that I think reflects that I was the first employee, but I don't do traditional CTO type activities most of the time.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:04.320
My day to day, I help lead the Shiny team specifically, which is a team of maybe 10 or 11 right now, mostly engineers.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.020
And we split our time between Shiny for R and Shiny for Python.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.940
Right now, probably more on the Shiny for Python side, given that there's so much more to do.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:22.020
And right now, I am in the thick of it, writing features for the next release of Shiny for Python, really getting to lean into React.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:29.380
I've been working with some really fun, like headless table libraries to build data grids with, you know, fast virtualized scrolling.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.660
That should be a really nice addition to Shiny for Python for the next release.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.200
Okay. Yeah, that sounds really cool.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.900
Well, let's talk about Shiny itself.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.940
I suspect a lot of people on the data science side have heard of Shiny, even though it's in the R space.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.380
I know the conversations come up around it.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.640
Other ones that kind of live in a similar orbit, maybe, are, you know, Streamlit.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.700
I've had Adrian on, the founder of Streamlit on before, and we've got Dash and Panel and Pinecone and others.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.580
So, you know, that sort of sets the stage for what this could be about.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:08.620
Maybe give folks a sense of just what is Shiny and it's, you know, maybe even in its R form originally.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.240
And then we can talk about the Python side.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.140
Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:22.500
So, Shiny is a way to create web applications easily without having to learn a lot of web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.140
Especially JavaScript.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.660
Especially JavaScript.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.480
100%.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.580
The interactive part of all these, like this callback hits that.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.260
Yeah.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:31.920
100%.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.400
Yeah.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.840
It was conceived primarily for data science.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:42.520
It is, I think a lot of the ideas behind Shiny are quite general and we'll, I'm sure we'll delve more into that.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:57.320
But we, in the creation design of this, we really are laser focused on data science and the kinds of problems that people want to solve by creating interactive visualizations, interactive reports, and even like workflow applications.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.240
But all of it around the analyzing of data.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.640
This was, in 2012, this was like a pretty radical notion.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:17.580
And I think there was a little bit of skepticism from some people close to us who were thinking, like, you're going to make data science, you know, like, why would data science scientists want to become web developers?

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:24.320
And I think this was, the answer was like, there are really a lot of problems that they can solve using interactive artifacts.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.740
But the whole point is that they do not have to become web developers.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:36.100
Yeah, I was going to say, like, you should turn that on its head and say, they don't want to become web developers, which is exactly the value proposition, right?

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.600
They want to share their work, and they want to make it interactive and collaborative.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:48.820
But the last thing they want, generally speaking, is to like, and I'm diving into Vue and React and all that stuff, right?

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.060
Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.980
Absolutely.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.580
Yeah.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:50.880
Yeah.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:58.340
And that being said, I think I personally am, you know, I've been doing web development since basically 1996.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:17.720
And the idea of working day in and day out on a project that was really sort of like my first website type, you know, like something that had a lot of guardrails, something that really limited you to whatever few tools were in its toolbox, that wouldn't be really satisfying or interesting for me.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:41.680
So even though Shiny is designed to be very easy to get started and for you not to have to know JavaScript or anything like that, if you do know JavaScript, if you do know HTML and CSS, if you, you know, live and breathe that stuff, but you want to create a convenient way to create data science related applications, Shiny really lets you lean into those skills as well and use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance or customize or extend Shiny for your own purposes.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.600
It's really important to us to capture sort of both ends of that spectrum.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.520
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by InfluxData, the makers of InfluxDB.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:14:00.300
InfluxDB is a database purpose built for handling time series data at a massive scale for real-time analytics.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:07.660
Developers can ingest, store, and analyze all types of time series data, metrics, events, and traces in a single platform.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.120
So, dear listener, let me ask you a question.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:16.320
How would boundless cardinality and lightning-fast SQL queries impact the way that you develop real-time applications?

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.020
InfluxDB processes large time series data sets and provides low-latency SQL queries,

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:27.860
making it the go-to choice for developers building real-time applications and seeking crucial insights.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:36.960
For developer efficiency, InfluxDB helps you create IoT, analytics, and cloud applications using timestamped data rapidly and at scale.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.340
It's designed to ingest billions of data points in real-time with unlimited cardinality.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:50.700
InfluxDB streamlines building once and deploying across various products and environments from the edge, on-premise, and to the cloud.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.720
Try it for free at talkpython.fm/InfluxDB.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.160
The link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.320
Thanks to Influx Data for supporting the show.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:11.700
We'll talk about the programming model and how it works, but I think maybe the first big contrast that I'd like you to set up for us is thinking of the Python side now.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.200
Like, why not just Jupyter Notebooks?

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.500
Why not Jupyter Notebooks or Jupyter Lab?

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.560
And just, we have that.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.460
That's on the web, sort of, kind of sometimes.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.520
It depends how we want to put it up there or share it or let it be executable.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.120
But, you know, compared to that, I think it's pretty different.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.520
But, you know, I think it's something that people maybe want to get their head around.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.480
Yeah, no, totally.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.020
You're right.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.440
I mean, you hear a lot of the same words being used, right?

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.080
Like, you know, it's browser-based applications that do interactive things.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:44.540
And I think the difference is that Jupyter and Jupyter Lab, those are sort of the places where data scientists can do work, right?

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.740
Where you can ask unbounded kinds of questions from your data.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:53.960
And that's where you iterate, where you do exploratory data analysis, where you, you know, write functions and things like that.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.460
And, yeah, you do have this beautiful immediacy to the results that you get, right?

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.060
That's why everybody really loves working in notebooks.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:06.320
And Shiny and frameworks like it are really for communicating outwards.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.000
It's really not for the data scientists to write code for their own understanding most of the time.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.080
It's really about creating a web application to show somebody else.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:25.860
Let's say that you, you know, are collaborating with some people that are, don't have the programming chops that you do, that have never launched a REPL in their life or installed Python.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:31.320
And you want to give them the ability to ask questions of your data and of your analysis.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:37.220
Maybe what if scenarios or in the simplest case, think like a BI dashboard or something like that.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:46.300
Like nobody's asking why, you know, execs need to look at a BI dashboard instead of running SQL queries on their own, you know, inside of a console.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.420
And this is similar.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:55.420
So if you want to create an interactive artifact for other people to consume, then Shiny and frameworks like it come into play.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.580
And Jupyter, not as much.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:02.240
I mean, you can certainly save Jupyter notebooks and then sort of share, you know, a link to the published notebook.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:08.200
But the interactivity is either non-existent or more limited when you do things that way.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:08.840
Absolutely.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:18.340
You don't want to give them the full notebook because the last thing you want is the general public typing Pantos code in there or arbitrary Python code.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.260
But you want to give them some interactivity.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:27.780
You know, maybe we could look at this little example down here just to, you know, just talk through like what an app might look like.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:36.420
Right on the homepage, shiny.posit.co, you have, you know, I think this is kind of a big statement towards your commitment to Python.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.720
It's like right on the homepage on equal, on par with R.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.560
It says get started with R, get started with Python.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.620
And you scroll down, it has the R in the Python code, right?

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.740
Like they're not like, hey, we also will make an attempt at this Python thing.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.160
But you've got this example.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.920
Do you want to give us a quick talk to what this app is?

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.420
It looks like it evaluates things about ducks and that's all I can tell about it.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.020
Yeah.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.740
Stuff about ducks.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.740
This is using the Palmer's Penguins dataset.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.420
Penguins rather, okay.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.280
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.500
So on the left, we have a sidebar with a number of controls.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.200
There's two select boxes.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.860
There's some check boxes.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.580
And then there's a couple of toggle switches.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:17.460
And on the right, you have a matplotlib generated scatterplot with some marginal plots added on.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:30.800
And this is sort of the hello world of Shiny, where you have one or more outputs and some inputs that when you change them, the output automatically updates.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:37.040
In this case, you can decide what variables do you want to apply to the X and Y axes.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.320
And then you can filter it by the species of penguin.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:47.900
And then there are a couple of toggles to just decide whether you want coloring by species and whether you want the marginal plots or not.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.640
And it sort of does everything that you would expect it to do when you select and deselect those values.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.820
Yeah, so for example, you have filter by species and Gen 2 is checked.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:04.860
But if I uncheck it, the whole UI redraws with just showing the other two species of penguin.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:11.920
And you can turn the species on and off and terms on whether or not like it highlights based on that.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.200
Yeah.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.880
You've got to drop down for different things you might compare.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.700
And you can just toggle those.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:23.120
And the UI changes kind of like you wrote a fancy front-end JavaScript framework where that's happening behind the scenes, right?

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:23.600
That's right.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.240
That's right.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.880
Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off there.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.180
Yeah.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.880
And just to be clear, when you say the UI redraws, we're not talking about a whole page reload.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.200
I mean, it's not 1998.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.960
It is, you know, the things that need to update, update on the page.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.280
Yeah.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.160
It's a really interesting way to create programs.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:46.180
And there's a couple other things I've seen that are like this, but I really, I think it's a super slick framework.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.100
Before we get into it, Diego's got a question.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:55.980
It says, could China be used to do fancy math, say, for someone trying to upload their GitHub website for their PhD thesis model?

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.600
Like, what can we create?

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.960
Like, could you create a kind of a LaTeX-looking integrated thing with interactive math bits in there?

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.780
Right, right.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.220
Yeah, yeah.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:09.420
So, yes, you do have the ability to do, well, I could interpret that question one or two.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:15.700
One is, yeah, can you do the computation for this PhD thesis model?

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.080
And in that case, absolutely.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.240
It's just whatever you can express in Python or R, for that matter.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:29.600
And in terms of putting, like, LaTeX equations on the screen, yes, this is a completely built-in feature for Shiny for R.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:35.640
And for Shiny for Python, it's a little less slick, but we do have an example application that shows how to drop in.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.280
It's based on MathJax, basically.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:44.580
So you can include the resources for MathJax and then write your equation in LaTeX format.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.700
And, yeah, it'll render.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.900
Diego, I hope that answers your question.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.400
Hope so as well.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:50.760
Yep.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.740
Seems like it.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.140
All right.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:59.540
So let's jump over to the GitHub page for a minute here and talk through some of the things that you all call out right at the top.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.700
So it's open source for one, right?

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.140
That's a big deal.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.920
It's under the MIT license right here on GitHub under PyGash Shiny.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:07.280
Yeah.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.740
I should add, you know, full disclosure, we are a for-profit company.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.640
We are a B Corp.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.620
Actually, we're a benefit corp, but we are for-profit.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:22.260
And Shiny for Python is completely open source, MIT license, no sort of gotchas there.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:28.440
When it comes to deploy your Shiny app, we have a variety of different ways you can do that that we offer as a company.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.820
We have an open source on-prem solution called Shiny Server.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:38.780
We have hosted cloud hosting that we manage that you can easily deploy to.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.520
And we have free and paid tiers.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:51.360
And we also have Posit Connect, which is a sort of a more comprehensive platform for enterprises to allow their data scientists to communicate with the rest of the organization.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:58.240
And that has, like, very robust enterprise-grade Shiny for Python hosting built in, and that is a paid product.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:58.600
Okay.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:11.900
Does it have, like, special ways to access, like, your SQL server on your enterprise, you know, like, access more authenticated access to data or auth to the thing itself to protect it and so on?

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.300
Yeah.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.140
For sure, auth to the thing itself.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.080
And it integrates with your, you know, LDAP or SSO-type systems.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:29.300
And it helps with scaling your application, so it will sort of monitor how much load each of your Python processes is getting and then spawn, you know, automatically scale up.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:37.580
It can, you know, hook up to Kubernetes in the back end so that your Shiny apps, the Python computation is happening, you know, in pods on the back end.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.900
So lots and lots of different ways that it sort of tries to make things easier.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.220
Sure.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:42.680
Okay.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.040
Cool.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:43.420
Very cool.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.160
So basically, short story is Shiny for Python's open source.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.640
I could take the on-prem open source thing and just host it myself if I wanted.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:23:00.320
I presume that means I could also fire up a virtual machine in the server, in the cloud, and install it up there and kind of, that's my on-prem if I wish.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.160
Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:09.020
And this is also, Shiny for Python is built on top of Starlet, which is the same underlying framework that FastAPI uses.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:14.140
So it's almost true that anywhere you can host FastAPI, you can host Shiny for Python.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:14.800
Oh, interesting.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.680
Just put some G-unicorn, UV-corn workers in front of it.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.300
Except G-unicorn.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:29.640
Yeah, the only exception is that because Shiny for Python is stateful and we can talk more about that as we, I'm assuming we're going to talk a little bit about how we compare to some of the other things out there.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:38.020
We do need, if you're going to load balance across multiple processes, it does have to be a stateful load balancer, which is normally quite easy to do.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.500
But G-unicorn is not stateless.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.240
It's not sticky.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:41.800
It's stateless, yeah.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.780
Sorry, yeah.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.460
So you need a sticky load balancer.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:50.360
And, oh, I should also mention that Hugging Face is another place that you can deploy Shiny for Python apps these days.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.200
Yeah, excellent.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:24:01.300
Okay, well, I think that that's certainly a fair trade-off to the commercial side of your story, which we started talking about by a new company and going to work on that.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:08.840
And it's really about sort of Shiny as a service and a Shiny cloud, so it's easy to not worry about the deployment side, right?

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.620
The app itself, the framework itself is about not worrying about writing web stuff.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.540
The deployment thing is still a deal, right?

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:21.320
If you just say, and then you just get dear data scientists, you fire up your Linux machines and you keep them up to date and secure.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.140
And that doesn't feel great to a lot of data scientists either, I'm sure.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.820
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:32.980
So I think with our open source on-prem hosting, it's like that.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.320
It's just a piece of software that you install on Linux.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:40.180
And with Connect, it's more like your IT department sets this up for you.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:52.820
And then you straight from your local machine, once you have your Shiny app working, you just type in a command like RS Connect deploy and point it at your server and everything gets taken care of for you,

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:58.080
including, you know, getting all the right Python dependencies installed on the server and using the right version of Python.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:07.900
And hopefully the act of, you know, we have customers that are writing multiple new Shiny apps a day and deploying multiple new Shiny apps a day.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:14.540
And, you know, the usefulness of that app might be a day or it might be, you know, five years.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.560
And we want to serve both sides of that spectrum.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.240
I suspect that does make a lot of sense.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:24.220
If you're a data scientist exploring something, you can be like, hey, look, I came up with this today.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.080
What did you think?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.740
And maybe the next day, based on feedback, you do something completely different and it's become irrelevant, right?

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.020
Yeah.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:37.500
And, you know, one interesting thing about this is, you know, you hear about something like Shiny for Python, like, you know, Streamlit or Dash.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:43.820
And you think that this is really about displacing, say, Power BI and Tableau, right?

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:50.840
But actually, in our experience with Shiny for R, the first thing it displaced were gigantic PDFs that people were sending around.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.540
You know, like, I have generated all of this data for my analysis.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.920
I don't know what you want.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:00.560
So here is like a 500-page PDF filled with tables for you to go explore.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.180
And with Shiny, you can present something that's much more interactive.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:10.560
That makes it much easier for some domain expert on the other side to find a needle in the haystack that you happen to be working together.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:17.980
Well, you know, you completely removed that cycle, that iteration cycle of what if we used a different number for this, you know, constraint here?

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.360
What if we only filtered?

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.940
It's like that's part of the UI.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.780
That's part of what you deliver is that interactivity.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.800
And as far as displacing things, it sounds like you're displacing SharePoint.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.120
If that could just be completely erased from the world, that would be awesome.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.640
Because every interaction I have with that software of sharing, like corporate doc sharing, is just like, oh, boy, here you go.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.480
Okay.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.040
Let's take it top to bottom maybe for here in this.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:47.760
Although I do have to point out, I could tell you still have that love for R because it's still 0.2% R.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.420
I love it.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.800
It's 47% Python, 47% Java Script.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.200
Yeah.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.740
0.2% R.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.220
I just want to make it clear.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.920
You do not have to install R to run Shiny for Python.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:05.960
I think that R is there's a couple of scripts that we use that we grab resources from the Shiny for RP repo.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.100
And I think, you know, that was one of the first things that one of our programmers did.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.700
And they didn't know Python yet.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.620
So they wrote it in R.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.720
That's fine.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.080
It's fine.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.940
I just thought it was funny.

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.680
It's there, but just a shade of it.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:18.940
Okay.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.880
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by GlareDB.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.380
GlareDB is an open source database for querying distributed data.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.240
Here's how it works.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.180
First, you connect your data sources.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:38.800
GlareDB makes it easy to connect to your data, no matter where it's stored, with integrations into many popular databases, data warehouses, and more.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:44.400
This includes Snowflake, Postgres, MongoDB, BigQuery, and object storage.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.340
Now you can query everything.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:51.140
You use the full power of SQL to query your data across these many different data sources.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.920
Join data across production databases and analytical warehouses without limits.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.460
Finally, you can use the tools you already know and love.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:04.200
Visualize and query your data using tools you know from Python's data science stack.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:09.580
With just a single import, you can query Pandas and Polar's data frames using just SQL.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:17.540
You'll be asking questions, extracting insights, and driving decisions with your data without waiting for an ETL pipeline to move data around.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.280
So if you have distributed data and disparate data sources, and you love open source, you owe it to yourself to give GlareDB a try.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.200
Visit talkpython.fm/GlareDB to get started.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.220
The link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.380
And please use the link to let them know that you came from us.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.680
Thank you to the team at GlareDB for sponsoring the show.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:47.280
So the first thing that you point out here is how is Shiny different from some of the things I said that it was like.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.220
For example, Streamlit or Dash.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.280
Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.760
Maybe touch on that a little.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.340
Sure.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.060
And I think really the one that comes up the most is Streamlit.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:02.680
Man, Streamlit really has taken the world by storm, it seems like, since they came out in, what was it, 2018?

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.340
Something like that?

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.000
Yeah, I think it's 2018.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.020
Yeah, it's only been a few years.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.020
It clearly really resonated with the Python world.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:15.180
I do have to say, I was very taken aback by the simplicity of their programming model when it first came out.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:22.920
And I pay a little bit of attention to, you know, new things that come out and purport to be high level web frameworks.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:28.140
And most of the time they were sort of like, okay, I recognize the tradeoffs that they're making here.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:32.300
But the Streamlit one was definitely a very bold choice that they made.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:47.000
Streamlit, I think it feels to me that they really prioritized ease of getting started and having the simplest possible mental model in a much higher level of priority than everything else, which is a bold stance.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.100
And I really applaud them for being sort of clear about what their vision is.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:58.600
So Streamlit is unbelievably easy to get started with, I think primarily because, I don't know if you've done a lot of Streamlit, but it has this top to bottom execution model.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.100
A little, not a ton, but yeah.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:29:59.620
Yeah.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:13.360
Like if you were to start out with, not a Jupyter notebook, but like a regular Python script that was doing a bunch of data analysis stuff, you know, reading data, maybe doing some transformations and then outputting some, you know, tables and plots.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:21.200
Streamlit lets you take that sort of straight up and down script and sprinkle in some Streamlit inputs and outputs.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.260
And boom, like you have now written an interactive Streamlit app.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:29.900
You just say, you know, Streamlit run and then the name of the file and it just works.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.180
In that sense, it's quite incredible.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.040
It's very easy to get started with.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:41.760
And the cost to spin up a new Streamlit app is so low that I was actually talking to another, to a YouTuber, Fanilo.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.220
I don't remember his last name.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.420
I think there's one Fanilo in the Streamlit world.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:53.920
And he was saying that he actually uses this instead of Jupyter notebooks to do interactive, you know, exploratory data analysis, which I thought was interesting.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:01.280
The sort of drawback of having this simple of a model is that it really works well for the simplest apps.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:08.220
And then the model is a little bit too simple for even like moderately complex.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.040
It's not even complex.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:16.900
But just like you're you sooner or later will often in a surprising way smack into some surprising wall.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.660
This is not something that is theoretical.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.500
We definitely have talked to a lot of Streamlit users.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:27.000
And even the happy ones will say, we really this is just for prototypes.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.540
And then we throw them out because you just cannot you can't think of Streamlit apps as something that can grow with you as your as your needs grow.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:41.420
So I think the sort of time from zero to value for Streamlit is almost zero.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.980
That's incredibly quick.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:50.960
But the time from value to the time of, OK, now we're going to throw this thing out and the last 20 percent.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.520
Yeah.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.580
And it's actually not the last 20 percent.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.500
I think it's more like the last 60 percent.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.440
And I mean, that might be uncharitable and unbiased.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:03.340
But but honestly, like in my using this framework, which is it's not to take away from their achievements.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:08.800
It's in it clearly has resonated incredibly strongly with a lot of people in the Python world.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:17.940
But I think, you know, no one who uses Streamlit seriously will tell you that you can do most of the things that you want in this sort of top to bottom execution model.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:23.620
You will often in surprisingly quick ways run into limitations there.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.680
And I do want to say, like Streamlit, they recognize this.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:33.080
And after some time they added, try to give you ways to work around that top to bottom execution model.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:39.680
They introduced the notion of session state and they introduced multiple attempts at nice caching abstractions.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:45.760
And I think they make somewhat more complex apps possible.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.840
But I really I mean, I'm happy to recommend Streamlit for those easy cases.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.520
I cannot recommend Streamlit once you start, you know, getting into session state.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.460
It really is quite a fragile paradigm to be coding in.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:07.120
And and by the way, just to make it clear here, I don't have a huge financial like motivation to lie about this.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.460
Posit Connect, which is the way, you know, we make money in this area.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.840
It is designed to host Streamlit as well.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.200
And we have custom like a lot of customers that do that.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.300
So it doesn't matter to us whether you use Shiny or Streamlit.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.460
I mean, it matters to me personally.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.300
Like it makes me feel good when people use Shiny.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.540
But as a business, we 100% love when our customers use a Streamlit.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.180
But it really is.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.520
I think we'll talk more about reactive programming later.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.380
I hope what it doesn't give you is a nice model for the complicated stuff.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.200
It only gives you a nice model for the very, very simplest stuff.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.240
Which serves an important role.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.740
But, you know, also means that Shiny might serve an important role, too.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:50.040
Another question from the audience, I think maybe worth the diversion is got real world examples of Shiny for Python that you could talk about.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.260
And let me take a step back since it's so brand new.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.200
Just Shiny, right?

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:54.700
You got that.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.780
Because I feel like the feature set is pretty similar.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.660
It's just like the R people have been at it for a lot longer, you know?

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.700
Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.540
And just to make clear, so Shiny for R has been around since 2012.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.080
Shiny for Python has been in alpha since last year.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:13.920
And we just took the alpha tag off in the last, I don't know, six weeks or maybe less than that.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.280
Yeah.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.180
So I think, and I'm sorry, I didn't come prepared with any more links than what's on the website.

00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:19.660
Yeah, no worries.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:25.360
We have a Discord where people are starting to gather and talk about some of the things that they're doing with Shiny for Python.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.860
So, yeah, I think on the left here, if you select, say, orbit simulation.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.520
Yeah, the orbit simulation is cool.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.300
This is a demo written by one of our engineers.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:40.480
But this is using, well, first of all, we haven't talked about this, but this is actually using Wasm.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.820
So there is no Python running on the background here.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:43.780
Okay.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:48.080
This is using a feature of Shiny called Shiny Live.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:54.620
So this is using Pyodide, which is the same sort of Python in the browser technology that PyScript is currently using.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.880
And you still write your Shiny app using Python.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.380
You still don't have to write any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.840
But when you run it, you can run it, you know, straight out of a web browser, as you can see here.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:13.960
So that's why it took a little bit longer to get started is because it's installing Python into your browser and, you know, installing AstroPy.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.700
Well, we say a while, it took like two seconds the first time.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.120
Sure.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.520
Yeah.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.400
Oh, I forget that.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:19.860
Yeah.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.580
For your listeners, they won't be able to see it.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.180
Yeah, exactly.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:22.800
Yeah.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:32.800
This is an example of like a relatively simple set of inputs and one 3D output that I think in this case is being rendered with Matplotlib.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:39.920
And you can choose some different parameters about the Earth, Moon, and Sun, and Planet X.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:49.960
And it has, you know, arbitrarily complicated calculations happening on the back end by AstroPy to determine like how these bodies would move when they're affected by each other's gravity.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:36:01.940
There's a lot of Shiny apps that are like this, that there is one particular algorithm, one particular model that it's demonstrating, and then wanting to show what happens when you try different parameters.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:08.880
So I'd say this is sort of in the simplest category of Shiny apps in terms of, you know, what's easy to imagine here.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.100
And yeah, there's some other stuff on the left there.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.080
Some example apps show the use of different widgets.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.100
So there's one for Plotly there.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:28.080
You can use the Plotly JavaScript-based visualization library with Shiny for Python if you want your scatter plots to have, you know, tooltips that show, you know, data, for example.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.600
I mean, this particular one seems not to do that much.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.240
And, you know, you can use...

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:32.420
The Wordle?

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.900
Yeah, there's a Wordle clone.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:35.440
I don't know.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.320
It looks like a...

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.060
It looks like a mobile phone keyboard.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.980
I mean, I have a whole keyboard right here.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.040
But it's like, now you can type into the mobile phone keyboard.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:45.540
Yeah.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.140
Yeah.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:46.660
Wordy?

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.060
No, it didn't take it.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.000
Come on.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:49.640
No.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:49.920
Yeah.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.060
That's pretty funny.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:53.460
Yeah.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:53.740
Yeah.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.300
Those are just the beginning ones, right?

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.300
You even have camera input.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.480
I don't know what that's going to do.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.180
Oh, this is designed for a phone.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.460
We have another example that's not on here that will use your webcam.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.320
But...

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:05.840
Yeah, it's okay.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.580
But it doesn't...

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.680
I don't think it works on the WASM mode.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.680
Yeah, there's probably security limitations or other differences.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.220
Yeah.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:13.540
Yeah.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:19.560
I will say one thing that you won't see as much here that you do see on Shiny for R is

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.400
like interactive dashboards or even non-interactive real-time streaming dashboards.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:29.780
Not because the sort of underlying technology is not there, but because the actual like UI

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:36.000
widgets for making something that looks like a dashboard is in Shiny for R, but not in Shiny

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.540
for Python.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:40.720
But that is coming within the next, I don't know, hopefully week or two weeks.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.420
So we have a new release coming that adds a lot more UI stuff.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:48.340
And that is a very, very common use of Shiny is for people that are creating dashboards that

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:54.380
show key performance indicators and time series plots and geographic data plotted on the

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.200
on an interactive leaflet map.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.020
That's bread and butter for a lot of data scientists out there who are using Shiny.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:00.940
Okay.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.980
That sounds very exciting.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.880
And the kind of stuff that no one wants to do on the web.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.000
Very few people want to do directly on the web.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.360
You want to be able to just grab a library.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:10.700
Yeah.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:11.020
All right.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:16.060
So I sent us a little bit on this diversion here over those, but maybe the next thing would

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.980
be reactive programming.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.240
Tell us about that.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:19.720
Yeah.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.080
So Shiny was really born out of this idea of reactive programming.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.400
That was the motivating concept.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.740
And for people who haven't heard that term before, maybe heard it, but never really were

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.840
clear on what it means.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:37.620
Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that can be applied to many different programming

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:43.980
languages where it's about making it easy to program against values that are changing over

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.340
time.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:52.060
In a normal programming paradigm, if you have a value X, say X equals one, and then you have

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:58.100
Y equals X plus one, and then you change the value of X, the value of Y does not change,

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:58.400
right?

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.980
It's not reactive in that way.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:07.680
Whereas if you were in Excel and you had one cell using another cell plus one, then you

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.960
would expect that to change.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.540
So Excel is sort of the most common example of a reactive model that I'm familiar with.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:19.860
And so you wire up the data to say, this number depends on these other numbers, and this one

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.900
depends on that formula.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:25.680
And it's the underlying reactive system just says, we're going to do the minimum amount of

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.540
recompute to keep them up to date.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:28.700
That's exactly right.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.620
That's exactly right.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:35.740
So in this case, the values that are changing might be a slider that is in your user interface,

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.080
right?

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:42.440
And when the user drags that slider from zero to five, there might be all sorts of downstream

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.680
calculations that need to recompute now because you've changed that value.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:54.560
And in a world prior to reactive programming, the dominant model was, and maybe in a lot of places

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.760
still is callback based programming or event handling is the other name for it.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.440
And that's, if you've ever used a framework that had like something called an on click or

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.560
something like that, you're doing event handling, right?

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.700
This button is pressed.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:12.980
I am going to execute this exact, you know, code in response to a button click.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:18.700
And in that world, which is a world that I inhabited for many years, doing full-time, very complicated

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.580
UI programming using that model.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.780
Sounds like some desktop programming, maybe some C-sharp or Windows Form, something like

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:25.060
that.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:25.920
That's right.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.440
That's right.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:26.880
Exactly.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.880
I worked at Microsoft working on Windows Forms apps that we shipped.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.020
And RStudio was created in that paradigm as well.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.800
It's actually quite difficult to do that kind of programming well.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:44.040
It's very easy to understand how to code in an event-driven sort of way or using callbacks.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:51.620
But to get your callback logic right as the number of events, the number of outputs, and

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:58.440
the number of intermediate sort of calculations as they increase, it's really hard to, number

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.160
one, keep it performant, and number two, keep it correct.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:06.260
And the idea for doing a web framework for data scientists actually predates me finding

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.920
out about reactive programming.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.020
And I actually said no.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:13.300
Like, I actually, JJ and I talked about it, and I was like, we could do it and we should

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:17.540
not unless we come up with some way that is better than event handling.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:23.280
Because what I didn't want to do was make it easy to come up with answers that were incorrect,

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.340
which is what I think callback-based programming makes it very easy for you to forget to update

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.620
some aspect of your calculation.

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.280
And now you have an answer, it's just not the right answer.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:32.600
Right.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.600
Maybe you update two graphs, but there's some number that has like a total in it.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.620
And you forget in your event handler, you've got to update all three.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.420
And so then...

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.220
And not just update all three.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:42.880
Yeah.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.260
Yeah.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.320
You'd have to update all three in the correct order, potentially, right?

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.880
Because one of those subcalculations might depend on the other.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:55.860
So the whole thing, it is certainly possible to create very complex or even simple, too complex

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.440
interactive stuff using callbacks.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.860
But I never felt like this was a great way to work.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:07.700
And when I was building these desktop apps, I often felt at the end of the day, like I had

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.380
been operating at the very edges of my mental capacity.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:17.900
And it's even worse when you go to modify existing code or, God forbid, have to help debug somebody

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:18.960
else's UI code.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.340
I mean, it really is very, very difficult.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:27.360
And I heard about reactive programming via this JavaScript framework called Meteor.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.980
And I don't know if you've heard of Meteor.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.880
Heard of it, but I haven't ever used it.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:32.420
Yeah.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.480
Not a lot of people have.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.020
I think it was very influential in terms of its ideas, but it didn't catch on anything

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.040
like React.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.180
But Meteor, I heard about it in 2012.

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.800
And I can't really convey how awe-inspiring it was to see.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:51.100
I think I saw like a five-minute demo that was on the front page of Hacker News.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:56.380
And, you know, I was just flabbergasted at what they were doing in this demo.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.360
And there were like no event handlers anywhere.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.300
And yet everything was just completely snappily updating.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:06.920
I was like so taken aback by this that it's stuck in my brain for weeks.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.400
Like I was like, how do they do that?

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.900
Like that doesn't make any sense to me.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:16.240
And I finally like did some Googling around and there was a Stack Overflow answer that indicated

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.300
like this is sort of more or less how it works.

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:25.120
You know, with that clue, I downloaded their source code and sort of found my way to how exactly

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.020
it was implemented.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.800
And I actually was getting on a plane and I downloaded the repo before I got on the plane.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.520
I was like, by the time this plane lands, I'm going to figure this out.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:39.840
And it actually is a beautifully elegant mechanism that, you know, I'll probably talk about someday.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:43.920
I mean, we could talk about it now, but I think it would probably be the rest of this rest of our

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.240
time.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:50.680
But it's a beautifully elegant and ultimately quite simple mechanism that underlies all this magic.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.100
When I saw that and eventually took me a couple of weeks to connect the dots, but when I realized,

00:43:55.100 --> 00:44:00.200
wait a minute, this could be how data scientists could create highly interactive things without

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:05.420
fear, without worrying that they're going to forget to update some intermediate thing and

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.300
get the wrong answer.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.880
Or worse, they wouldn't worry about it.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.720
They just get the wrong answer and then be angry after the fact, right?

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.240
We're going to retract that paper.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:12.760
I'm sorry.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:13.260
Yeah.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.900
Yeah.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:20.940
On the R side, it really has, these ideas have proven themselves out year after year after

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.260
year.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:25.440
I think people are building incredibly cool things in reactive programming with no background

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:31.180
in software engineering, much less hardcore front-end web development.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.560
So I really do believe, you know, there are a lot of different ways people are solving this

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.600
problem in Python.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:41.980
You know, Streamlit and Dash each have their own takes and Pinecone and Solara, all these

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.680
different ones.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:49.980
And the ones that sort of have thought carefully about this problem of how do you help people

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:55.240
programming against what is inherently a dynamic system while staying safe, while making sure

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.980
that you're getting the right answers every time and doing it in an efficient way.

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:02.120
Those are the ones that I think are closest to the spirit of Shiny.

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.880
And that's really why I think Shiny for Python needed to exist.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:11.800
Because I mean, I looked at Dash and Streamlit and I just felt like, you know, I'm glad that

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.940
people are really getting a lot of value out of these, especially out of Streamlit.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.360
But I really feel like this needs to exist as well.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:24.200
We really need like an industrial strength reactive framework for things that are not just

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.380
top to bottom execution.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.720
One thing that's standing out to me on the page here is you talk about there are a few utility

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:34.640
functions to help manage or utility things to help manage reactivity.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:41.640
And one is context blocks, you know, with isolate and other ones are decorators for functions.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:48.820
And, you know, just those two things are pretty, pretty solid Pythonic constructs of the language.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:49.500
Right.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:54.600
And so it looks like you put some thought into not just writing our code in Python, but trying

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.700
to embrace some of the Pythonic language capabilities.

00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.440
Yeah, that's absolutely right.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:04.980
It was really important to us when we were talking about the design philosophy for Shiny

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:09.180
for Python to really make it a Python first experience.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:14.580
That's not necessarily like, I think the other choice is defensible too, which is let's make

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.340
these two frameworks look as similar as possible so that you can seamlessly move from one to the

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:18.600
other.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:25.720
And I was just not convinced that anyone would really enjoy writing our style code in Python.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.140
Like I wouldn't.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.040
I mean, that just feels something feels hacky about that.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:30.260
Yeah.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.000
So yeah, we definitely spent some time and I'm not new to Python.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.860
I think I learned Python originally in 2003, something like that.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.200
And I've spent some time with the language.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:44.780
So yeah, it felt to me like so much of Shiny is this reactive programming is about creating

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:51.820
independent units of either this is code that generates a plot or this is code that calculates

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:52.540
a data frame.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:58.200
And taking those little bits of code and deciding when is the right time for each of them to run

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.940
because there are like dependencies between these different blocks.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:07.380
And the notion of these being functions that have decorators on them felt to me like a pretty spot

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.600
on analogy, right?

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:14.160
Like you're creating a chunk of code, which in Python is a function, and then you are annotating

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.640
it with an indicator of your intent.

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:21.800
So in Shiny, you would write, you know, for a plot output, you would say def plot one or

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.380
whatever you named that plot.

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.700
You would have your matplotlib code inside.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:30.020
And then as a decorator to that function, you would say, this is an output.

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.340
And the type of the output is a plot.

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:37.580
Now, I will say that being said, I have been a little bit surprised how many data scientists

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.540
in Python I've talked to have not worked with decorators.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:45.660
I mean, most of them are familiar enough, but like a non-zero amount of people have told me,

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.900
like, I haven't done decorators before, and this is a little bit scary.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.840
So that was not something that I was anticipating going into this.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.540
So yeah, so I got a couple of thoughts.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:58.560
One is, if you went with your alternate reality, where you said, let's make them as identical

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.680
as possible, there's certainly a case to be made for that, I agree.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:08.140
But that would sort of say the primary audience is the people that flows between R and Python.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:13.920
Which is certainly non-zero, but it's not like, let's try to resonate most deeply with

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:19.240
just the Python community full stop rather than the transit folks, you know?

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.240
Yeah, that's right.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:24.600
So I would say, I mean, looking in from the outside, that this looks like a good choice.

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:31.360
Second, the with concepts and the decorators and data scientists is, I think one of the powers

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:36.500
of Python, the reason a lot of data scientists use it is you can be really effective with a

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:42.280
partial understanding, a highly partial understanding of what Python is and how it works, right?

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.920
Like you might not know how to create a class.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:48.240
You might not even know how to create a function, but you can still pip install a few cool libraries

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:52.640
or condo install them and then run top to bottom five lines that generate an amazing output,

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:52.980
right?

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:58.540
And so I think there's a, not talking about all data science, but I think there's a slice

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:03.160
of kind of pretty new to Python data science who are like, came from somewhere else.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.660
Like I heard this is awesome and I'm starting to get some traction with it, but even they

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:12.060
haven't gone into, you know, crazy concepts of decorators that take functions and star arg

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.840
wraps them and returns other functions.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.980
You know, like that said, from a syntactical perspective, I think it's pretty, he's like,

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.800
oh, this function, it has to be reactive.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.580
So I put at reactive event on it.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.080
Yeah, that's right.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:24.440
Yeah.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:24.940
Yeah.

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:29.420
Um, you're asked if there's, any examples, with user authentication.

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:34.600
I know there's, you guys have a, your gallery, which is what I skipped before, but the gallery,

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.800
I think is maybe easier to quickly browse, but there's more in the examples.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.260
Yeah.

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.360
And honestly, we are a little behind on the examples.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:46.280
Uh, we spent a lot of the last, six months working on features and not on examples.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:50.400
You've been busy building the thing, not talking about what you could.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:50.940
Yeah.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:51.200
Yeah.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:51.560
Yeah.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.980
Uh, so I think we need our examples to catch up a little bit.

00:49:53.980 --> 00:50:01.220
Um, I will say that user authentication is something that we have as part of both hosted platform

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.600
and for Posit Connect.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:09.200
So I think a lot of companies that are trying to sort of have a similar business model as

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:17.080
us and have a open source framework and also some kind of enterprise hosting often draw the

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:21.280
line that way, that, that authentication is one of the things that isn't in the framework.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.280
It wraps the framework.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:28.060
That being said in shiny for R people definitely went ahead and wrote their own packages that

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.660
put authentication into the framework and made it open source.

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:35.040
And I'm sure those things are going to happen in a shiny for Python very quickly as well.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.300
Yeah.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.140
How similar is the execution model?

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:44.200
Like the internals, what's happening conceptually on the server stuff or even on the website across

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:44.400
those?

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:44.760
Yeah.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.560
There's a couple of ways to answer that.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:52.340
I would say right now it is surprisingly close, which is not really what we were anticipating.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:51:00.760
Shiny for Python is written in asyncio and that async framework is quite different than how async works

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:10.320
in R. And I think we, after, you know, spending a lot of time on this implementation, the mental model for the shiny app author is actually quite similar.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:16.460
So where we ended up, I think it does for all intents and purposes as an app author, it's a very similar execution model.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:29.680
So each user, if you were to launch a shiny for Python app right now from your, not from Wasm, but like using a regular shiny for Python, running it out of Python, and you connected three web browsers, they would all be running in the same process.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:35.200
Each one gets their own copy of their, their own session, basically.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.660
So there's no confusing whose inputs are applying to whose outputs.

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:45.940
Everybody has their own copies of inputs and outputs and they're wired together, but it's all running on the same process and it's all running.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:47.800
Currently, they all run on the same thread.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.120
We do that on purpose because you can also have shared reactives.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:52:02.320
So, you know, you could have global variables that essentially when one browser updates them, everybody gets an update and you could have some kind of shared scoreboard or a chat room or whatever.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.500
That being said, if you want, you can also do async.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:10.140
So your outputs and calculations can also be async functions.

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:19.840
And therefore your session, if it's doing some kind of long running async calculation, can give up its control of the thread to some other session that can execute.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:25.360
Right, or it's doing some database thing where it's pulling a bunch of data, can say, we're waiting on the database.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.120
You guys keep going.

00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.020
Yeah, that's right.

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:27.340
Okay.

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:29.880
So we're getting short on time here.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.360
Let me ask you two more questions.

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:38.000
The first one is, I think from a community perspective, like what opens up now, right?

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:45.000
So we have R and we have Python and there are similarities between these, but there's really smart people doing creative and powerful stuff on both sides.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:53.840
Because of the chronology, I guess, mostly I imagine that there's more Shiny work that's happened on the R side than on the Python side.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:53:03.580
But how much does this make it possible for people who maybe wrote a book with Shiny for R and they might want a Python version, right?

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:20.920
It seems to me that having this as an option, if the whole UI is now kind of almost equivalent, if not syntactically identical, like, oh, all of a sudden we could have these two versions or we could move from one side of that fence to the other and still stick with Shiny in the same reactive programming model.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:21.340
Yeah.

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.580
I want to make sure I get your question right.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:30.200
Are you talking about people who are sort of in the Shiny ecosystem who have like extension packages and things like that?

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.300
Or are you talking about people who write Shiny apps?

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.300
People who write Shiny apps.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.440
People who are like users creating these Shiny apps.

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:42.100
Maybe they created them in Shiny for R and they're like, I've always wanted to do a Python one, but I really like Shiny, so I'm not going anywhere.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.920
You know, but now there's Shiny for Python, you're like, oh, maybe this is a way to have that as an option, right?

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:53.900
Or I'm a teacher teaching a class at a college and I did it with Shiny in R and they're telling me I have to move to Python.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:56.780
I thought I'd use Streamlit, but maybe now I can move over.

00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:00.440
Like, how much do you see that scenario coming into play now?

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.500
We absolutely are.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:01.820
Yeah.

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.120
And I think I underestimated this a little bit.

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:20.980
I think what I was anticipating is that people who are very comfortable with Shiny for R and comfortable with R in general might see Shiny for Python as sort of a threat as, you know, the Shiny team has given up on R and all they care about is Python now and they're selling out to the Python, you know, crowd or whatever.

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:24.440
And that really has not been the case at all.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.940
And then, Joe, you come on this podcast and oh my goodness.

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.760
Yeah, that's right.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.340
Just kidding.

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:33.560
In fact, it's almost been a sense of relief.

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:37.100
And that applies as well to, you know, our company name was RStudio.

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.200
We rebranded Deposit.

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:46.000
And similarly, we announced both things at the same conference that we were going from RStudio Deposit in terms of our company name.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.500
And Shiny for Python is now going to be a thing in addition to Shiny for R.

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:56.580
And I almost feel like the predominant emotion that we got from our community was relief.

00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:04.360
Because I think unless you're in very specific fields, there's nobody that doesn't have some Python around them, right?

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:13.100
That maybe your team does R, but then you have this sibling team that, you know, maybe is more ML model heavy, and they definitely use Python.

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:16.420
Or your IT department really is a lot more comfortable deploying Python.

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:30.040
And I think as much as people love R, knowing that they have the option, knowing that they can take these ideas that they really like from R and be able to reuse them in Python.

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:34.400
I mean, yes, there will be some syntax to learn, but that's never the hard part, right?

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.160
I mean, the hard part is everything that you express using syntax.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.060
The libraries and the UIs and all that, yeah.

00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:39.800
Yeah.

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:53.320
So that's really what we've heard is that people, even if they're like totally happy with Shiny for R, they're happy that Shiny for Python exists because they know that if the time comes where they have to add that to their toolkit, that it's an option.

00:55:53.320 --> 00:56:02.440
And they don't have to now try to map everything that they know and take for granted from Shiny to have to map that to Dash or to Streamlit or Panel or something like that.

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:09.020
Yeah. You know, another example is you work at a university where R is actually really has a good stronghold, right?

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.440
It has a, especially in the math and statistics department.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:18.740
But maybe you were working with some astronomers and that their whole research group does Python and you want to work with them.

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.640
But, you know, like you also want to bring Shiny, right?

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:30.900
So that's what, like that, all that conversation right there kind of encapsulates why I thought this would be a really cool topic to have you on the show is, you know,

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:34.320
it kind of opens up this bridge for a lot of people in a lot of directions.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:45.740
Yeah. And speaking of bridges, a member of my team pointed out that, you know, he's someone who in his previous job went from an R organization to like a more Python heavy organization.

00:56:45.740 --> 00:57:00.020
And as someone who's coming from an R world, it can be a little bit intimidating, you know, to sort of start at the, of the ladder again, especially if you're in some kind of, you know, a team situation where you expect to be productive and to contribute to the team.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:18.040
And Shiny for Python, especially being new, the people are coming from the R world and sort of find themselves, whether by choice or involuntarily, you know, needing to do Python, that Shiny for Python might be an interesting, like you said, bridge for them to go from one ecosystem to the other,

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:23.500
while maintaining a certain level of familiarity and to be able to deliver a lot of value.

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:32.120
Because I mean, one of the reasons I think Shiny resonated on the R side is because the things that you build with Shiny, if they have value, they are extremely visible.

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.300
They're extremely visible to your coworkers inside your organization.

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:42.880
And it really, you're talking about how, you know, people coming up and saying how they've built impactful things with, with Shiny.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:56.700
Another common theme I heard was how much Shiny helped their careers going from doing work in a REPL or a notebook and instead being able to deliver very dramatic interactive applications.

00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:00.940
It's a really powerful way to, to, to have an impact in your organization.

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:01.580
It is.

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:12.540
And I think data scientists, and especially this kind of like visual, let me turn the knobs and see what happens type of experience, is the type of person that has the ear of pretty high up folks.

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:20.840
And if you've got powerful tools like this to make a good impression, you're like, they asked me, I asked them if they could give us predictions of this, or if they could rethink this.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.040
And they came back with a new web app the next day.

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:23.740
Are you kidding me?

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.280
It took us six months to redesign our stupid website for the homepage.

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:27.860
You know what I mean?

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:28.700
Something like this, right?

00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:30.460
And so it lets you look good, right?

00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:31.420
To the right people.

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:32.020
That's right.

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:32.720
100%.

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.040
Yeah.

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:33.360
Cool.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.040
Joe, I'd say you're making a big impact here.

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.480
We got Alan out there saying, I just started using Shiny during this live stream.

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.020
Yes.

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:44.700
How hard is it to deploy this into an AWS EC2 instance, for example?

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:45.940
Yeah, you totally can.

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:48.580
The easiest thing to do is to look up Shiny server.

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:54.700
Most of the documentation talks about, you might find it on the R side of the website, but it's actually all the same.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:59:01.820
So if you're using Ubuntu, it's a simple install of a Debian package.

00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:04.080
If you're using Fedora, it's an RPM.

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:08.120
And it should be pretty easy to get started with.

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:14.220
But also don't forget that you can also just sling it into our free hosting, especially if you're just getting started.

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:14.480
Yeah.

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.280
Excellent.

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:15.920
Excellent.

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.580
Roadmap.

00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:17.640
Let's close it out with Roadmap.

00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:18.140
Yeah.

00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:24.380
So in the upcoming release, we have been focused a lot on UI components.

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:28.800
And that's something that we're going to continue to focus on for a while.

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:35.440
We definitely want to make the more dashboard-y type applications very easy to write.

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:41.820
And we also are wanting to beef up on the output side of some of our widgets.

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:43.980
So we don't have a great table widget right now.

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:49.040
It just kind of takes a Pandas table and renders it to HTML using Pandas styler.

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.380
But we want to have fast, scalable virtual grid, basically.

00:59:53.380 --> 01:00:01.240
And also for more interactive type outputs like that, I should mention that we support IPy widgets natively.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:06.500
So most IPy widgets will just drop right in, including Plotly and PyDeck.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.120
And well, most of them work just fine.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:14.920
And we'll be doing more to sort of make some of those feel a little bit more native.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.260
And the IPy widget stuff works great.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:23.180
But I think we also want to make it feel a little bit more functional in some cases than object-oriented.

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:23.840
Yeah.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.740
And we have a lot of examples to write, a lot of documentation to write.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.540
And there are also quite a few features to port over from Shiny4R.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:40.860
And the last thing I'll say is that automated testing is something that we are working on as well, making it easier for you to write automated tests for your Shiny4Python apps.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.820
It's an approach that's based on PlayWrite that we use internally right now.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:53.740
But we're going to have helper classes and functions to make it a little less boilerplate-y to write these kinds of tests for Shiny4Python apps.

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:54.080
Nice.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.080
PlayWrite's really cool.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:55.400
Yeah.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:55.980
Yeah.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.040
Very, very, yeah.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:58.680
Very, very cool.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.840
Like Selenium, but more Pythonic.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.740
So pretty neat.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:01.980
Yeah.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:02.720
Yeah.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.920
Well, it's a cool roadmap.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.880
People want, they've got ideas.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.180
They want to reach out to you.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.020
Is GitHub an option?

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.680
Like, do they open an issue?

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.540
Do they email you?

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.500
How do they reach you guys?

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:12.720
Yeah.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:19.620
So we have a GitHub issue is always appreciated and we will absolutely read those and engage.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:28.180
We also have a Discord for things that are a little more, you know, if you want a little bit more of a back and forth and, or do you just want to meet us?

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:34.560
Do you just want to talk about, you know, any of the design decisions we've made or how we might be different than, you know, XYZ framework?

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.960
We're happy to talk to anyone and everyone.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.220
And I think to get to the Discord is on our GitHub homepage, I believe.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:41.740
Excellent.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:41.900
Excellent.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.140
Let's see if I can find a Discord.

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:44.900
There you have it.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.060
Join us on Discord right on the homepage and the read me of the GitHub.

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:48.400
Yeah.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.020
All right, Joe.

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:49.860
Thanks for being here.

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:50.600
Thanks for creating this.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:50.900
Thank you.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:51.340
This is cool.

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:57.760
I think it's a nice contribution and really, like I said, it's a cool bridge between the R and Python communities.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.260
Thank you.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.900
If you don't mind me saying so, I really enjoy your podcast.

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:05.600
And I think that you are, you're quite good at this.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.360
And I just really appreciate all the conversations that you've had.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:19.320
You seem like just a really generous interviewer and you do a really great job of sort of helping people really feel three-dimensional, even when we're talking about like very technical stuff.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.080
So I appreciate that.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.080
I really appreciate that.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.240
That's super kind.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.000
Thank you for saying that.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.580
And thank you for being on the show.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:25.840
