00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.200
I'm always on the lookout for a good Python UI framework.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.020
In this episode, we're going to focus on one called DeerPyGUI.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.720
DeerPyGUI is a fast and powerful graphical user interface toolkit for Python with minimal

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.140
dependencies. It's created by Jonathan Hofstad and Preston Cothran, and they're here to tell

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.620
us all about it. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 348, recorded November 18th, 2021.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:42.840

Let me tell you about a new project I'm working on. It's a YouTube series called Python Shorts.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.600
This series will consist of fun and quick videos teaching you one amazing thing about Python.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.520
They're usually less than five minutes long and put a practical spin on topics you might have been

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:39.600
and counting the number of times an item appears with collections.counter. I already have a list of

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.680
about 100 videos to create over the next year in this series, so there will be many more to come.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.620

Let's get to that interview. Jonathan Preston, welcome to Talk Python to me.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.100
Hi, glad to be here.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.980
Hey, it's great to have you guys here. I'm very excited to talk about GUIs and UI frameworks and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.120
stuff like that. I think Python needs more of it and we're building some cool projects,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.160
frameworks there. It'll be fun to talk about it. We're going to talk about DeerPyGUI,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.640
which is one of these frameworks tries to have a quick getting started story.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.460
That is correct.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.020
Let's just get into your stories and hear a little bit about you since there's both of you,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.560
maybe not too extended, but Jonathan, how do you get into programming in Python?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:57.160
I got into programming when I was around 13 years old. My stepdad and mom got me a C++ for dummies book.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.080
And worked with that for a while until just as a hobby project or as a hobby thing. And once I got to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.720
college, I went to mechanical engineering, which is also where I met Preston. They typically like to

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.980
use MATLAB, which everybody knows isn't a real programming language. The indices start at one.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.700
Of course.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.920
As an alternative to that, ChemCurls Python. It had a lot of the same features, actually a lot

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.220
more features than MATLAB and it was free. So didn't have to pay for the MATLAB license.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.360
Yeah. MATLAB is expensive for people who haven't messed with it. It's like really expensive outside

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.360
the student story.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.380
It is. And you have to use their entire environment and everything just to, just to use it. So aside

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.900
from that, on top of that, with the Raspberry Pi, it was into electronics and things like that. And

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.660
the Raspberry Pi are able to control the GPIO pins using Python. Naturally, I just started playing

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.460
with Python from there. And yeah, that's pretty much where Python came into my picture.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.020
So you said you were in chemical engineering? Is that what it was?

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.620
Mechanical.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.120
Mechanical. Okay. I was in chemical for a little while and they said that, I asked if I could take

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.980
a C++ class. They said, you can as an elective, but you have to take Fortran because that's going

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.840
to be the most important language you ever learned. I thought, I'm just jealous. MATLAB is not that

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.600
amazing, but I'll tell you what, it's better than Fortran.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.020
That is very true. We occasionally have to use Fortran at work with our FEA programs,

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.280
finite element analysis programs with Abacus. You're able to extend it with Fortran. So

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.220
occasionally we have to look at a little bit of Fortran to do that. And it's, yeah, it's ugly.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.720
Yeah, for sure. Preston, how about you?

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.620
Mine was mostly junior year in college, MATLAB course. Incidentally enough, that's why it's not

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.700
a real programming language. I moved from that directly into Python. I thought when I started

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.860
my first job and I just started working with C++ after that and then tailed into a little bit of C,

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.180
not much. Right on. And what are you all doing now? Sounds like still engineering work?

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.580
Yeah. So I'm doing engineering. So I'm doing mechanical engineering. I'm doing design on

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.960
threaded connectors for oil and gas industry, mainly designing the seals and threads that hold

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.380
production tubing together down hole that actually sends the oil up through the well.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.060
Wow. So you must be talking about a lot of pressure, talking about materials that would

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.920
like to destroy rubber and other things as well, possibly.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:24.620
Yeah. So I guess that, that tails into coding. Mainly we, or I use most of Python to just extend

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.140
that because like we were talking about for scripting and stuff like that.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.600
Yeah. Jonathan?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.160
I started out in the same position and slowly moved into the software side of things. A lot of that's

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.700
working with Preston, some of the other mechanical engineers on extending some of those applications

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:47.640
like Abacus and that choosing Python or extending AutoCAD and that's C++. So there's that side of

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.640
the day-to-day work. And then the other side is we actually have some internal software that

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:59.800
we work on one for inspecting connections without contact. So using lasers and robot arms and all

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.440
that stuff to basically just take measurements instead of having to go out and manually doing

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:12.120
it. This, this can be on an assembly line and most of that's in C++ and C. We do use our library,

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:20.280
DeerPock GUI for a lot of the prototyping and some of the tooling for the project, but for projects in C and C++.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.800
Sure. I don't think I've really covered mechanical engineering on Talk Python properly. What's the

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.880
story with software automation and that kind of stuff? Is it mostly using programs like sounds

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.120
like this Abacus one versus writing your own software, doing your own automation?

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:45.160
A large part of mechanical engineering is, at least in our field, is stress analysis and computational

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.960
fluid dynamics, fluid flow type problems. And as far as software goes, it's usually in relation to that.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.800
Like Abacus is, as an example, a software package for stress analysis. And then there's other ones,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.600
OpenFoam.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.120
Yeah, OpenFoam. You, you wrote some solvers at your first job for that?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:09.080
Yeah, that, that's correct. We took some electives while we were in college and some of those were for

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.240
writing these solvers. And most of those you could write in whatever you want. Those professors didn't

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.840
actually care. And a lot of times I wrote in Python on there. Most of the time it was Python, I would say.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.920
Yeah. What's the story for packages, PyPI type of things in your space?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.000
As far as what we used or what we used?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.920
Yeah. Is there a lot of stuff out there? I know, for example, astronomy is filled with libraries,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.120
like AstroPy and whatnot that people could just grab and use.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.040
For mechanical engineering, I don't know if there's NumPy or NumPy.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.280
Yeah.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.680
Yeah.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.000
But as far as specific to mechanical engineering, I really don't think there's any. There may be a few

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.160
FEA solvers, but I don't think they're maintained or well documented for sure.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.360
We typically found that a lot of engineers end up staying in the MATLAB realm and not really venturing

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:59.960
into any more hardcore languages. So they end up using all, because a lot of them want symbolic math,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.240
integration and ODE solvers and all of that. It's all right there in MATLAB. And then the companies

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.320
typically pay for it. So you're in that realm.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.280
And once some group gets embedded in there, it's just going to stay in that space unless somebody

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.840
takes some effort. Yeah. All right. Awesome. Thanks for that background. Although we're not here

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.480
exactly to talk about deep dive in mechanical engineering, it is cool to get a look. Let's talk

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:29.000
about your project, your PyGUI. So when I think of the GUI graphical user interface space

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.480
in Python, there's TK-Enter, there's PyQt, there's a few other things, but they all have some kind of

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.640
oddity about them. There's not like one framework that people just like, yeah, we're just going to

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:47.000
use that thing. It's not like a Swift and Objective-C Coco controls would be in say,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.560
an iOS app or something, where it's really clear. Just generally use that one. Where did you guys get

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.720
started working on GUIs and Python? What was the goal with the Geopy GUI? Like where does it stand

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:02.440
out? Where does it fit in this space? I got started in UIs working at one of my internships while I was in

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:09.880
school. And we were using this package, which I think I already mentioned once, open foam for CFD.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:16.840
And it didn't have a front end interface at all. It was a C++ solver that just pretty sure just output

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.640
text files in the end. I don't remember. It's been about six, seven years. So I wanted to build a UI so

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:27.080
that the other engineers could use it. And at that time, I was just getting into it. So I used to Kentr

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.920
because, you know, it's a Python. And then also used VTK, if I remember correctly. That would,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.800
I would say that's the first experience I had with it. And then our senior design project,

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.840
being pressed were also on the same team for that, was to build an arc welding 3D printer.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.120
It actually created things by doing arc welding. Right.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.640
Rather than printing some other sort of material out of it.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:55.960
Right. Yeah. It was a MIG welder. I was on the software side of that. Preston was on a lot more

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.200
of the physical side. We should put them in the software for now.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:04.360
Yeah. Anyway, built, that was the goal of the project. And we used some open source

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.720
slicing software. I don't remember. It's like Slicer 3D or...

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.160
It had a three for the E. Yeah. Slicer and it had three for the E. And we basically modified that

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:19.480
and ran it in a headless mode and built a UI on top of it using Tkenter. And I want to say we used

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.160
Pygame to be able to access OpenGL. And at the time we were using legacy OpenGL. Those are first

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:31.720
experience with graphics APIs. Yeah. Which, you know, OpenGL is pretty neat. It was certainly

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.600
good when it first came out. It was as good as anything else. But I feel like it hasn't been

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.680
getting the same amount of growth and adoption, maybe as some of the other frameworks, DirectX and Metal and

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.320
so on.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:50.680
DeerPyGUI uses DirectX, Metal and OpenGL at the moment. So we've been using a lot of them over the last few

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:58.040
years. And the biggest reason for that is just that the hardware's changed since those APIs were

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.240
created. And they no longer directly match the hardware.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:08.840
DeerPyGUI came out of trying to basically build something better than direct OpenGL access. What'd

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.400
you say? Or direct framework access?

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.960
DeerPyGUI not quite. It came more out of a, I guess, going back to answering where

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.920
where DBG itself came from. We had a previous project that we worked on, a commercial project

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:28.360
on engineer sandbox. The program had an embedded Python interpreter in it. And you basically created little

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:35.240
mechanical engineering apps. And we could create one in, I don't know, an hour or two. And it was just

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:41.160
this collection of apps. And over time, it started to get a little annoying to have to recompile it,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.720
especially before we added Python. We added Python because we were getting tired of

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.720
recompiling it every time we want to add an app or modify something and have to redeploy.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:55.000
From there, we embedded Python. And it was very limited. You were able to create a few

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.640
small apps. You couldn't, it really wasn't a full GUI library. What happened is we were trying to sell it.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.600
Didn't really work out. We can never really catch traction. And we had some users and customers,

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.960
but most people weren't really interested in it. And developers aren't really interested in paying for

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:19.400
libraries or any SDK. Most of them just wanted to be free. So that just kind of fell out. And we gave

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.240
up on that after that. That's a tough place to be, right? You want to put a lot of energy into building

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.320
tools and making stuff for people. How do you put enough time into it if people just want it to be free?

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:36.920
Maybe what we got to do is maybe the world is the VS Code model where there's large companies that have

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.840
other motivations for creating it rather than directly funding through that. But that's a deeper

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.600
conversation that we have to solve.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.160
Selling to developers in easy is the key point there.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.280
Yeah, sure.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.560
So we did keep it in house and we continued. We still have apps written in it at our day job.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.680
We ended up revisiting it because it didn't do everything we wanted to do. And we said,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.800
this time let's target developers from the beginning. So it's not going to be very limited. It's going to be,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.680
should be able to do most things you can do in any other UI library. And on top of that, make it free.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:14.280
And that's where your PI GUI came from. And between those stages, we came across the library

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.160
or in GUI, which I'm not sure if you're familiar with, but...

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.720
Yeah, I'm not familiar with it. What is this?

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.840
It is a...

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:28.600
It is an extremely popular immediate mode graphical user interface for real-time applications.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.840
It's usually used.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.720
C++.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.840
Yeah, it's C++.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.840
But it's kind of a weird, I mean, it's an immediate mode interface and there's not many,

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.640
I would say there is no Python user interface that's like that. And if you look at it...

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.800
Maybe we should talk about the different modes real quick, since you bring it up.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.000
This immediate mode versus retained mode. What are those two worlds? What does that mean?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.720
I take this one.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.720
So I don't want the internet to jump on me here because there's a lot of...

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:04.280
A little bit of argument there, but there's a few key points, I think, that really make it stand out.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:11.720
One of those is that the stage is not retained. If you have a slider that controls a float,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:17.880
it doesn't... You don't have to basically have a float stored on your side and a float stored in the UI,

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.280
and you're constantly having to deal with keeping them up to date and things like that. Instead,

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.000
the library itself doesn't store that at all. Now, the way it's implemented is a little different,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.720
but I'm talking about from the user side of using an immediate mode library.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:36.840
It doesn't retain any state. The other big thing is that, at least with, especially when it's on GUI,

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:44.040
is the UI items and widgets are submitted every frame. So 60 times a second. And that gives you a

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.760
credible amount of dynamicism, I guess you'd call that. To be able to do a lot of things,

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.920
and completely redo the UI on a per-frame basis, you can...

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.120
Yeah, as opposed to something where maybe you say a text box goes here and a button goes there,

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.560
and then you set the text to the button, and then the button knows what its text is.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.240
This is almost like a game loop type thing where it...

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:05.880
Right.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.240
Each time, like however, whatever the frame rate is, 50, 60, 200 frames a second, it's like,

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.880
draw the UI, draw the UI, draw the UI, right?

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:19.880
Yep. And the interesting that that kind of 60 frames a second can lead into what we just put in a few

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.920
weeks ago talking about not redrawing the GUI every 60, every frame.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.760
Right. That's a good point. One of the issues we had, especially early on with some users complaining

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.560
as well, do you need to update everything every frame 60, 60 times a second?

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:41.400
So we did recently add in 1.1, the ability to basically stop, only update if there is some

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.040
user input, whether that's moving the mouse or resizing the window, things like that, because

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:51.320
a lot of people, they'd complain to be more energy conscious with having your GUI run all the time.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.840
Which you might care about, say, on a laptop or a tablet, but less so if you're plugged into the wall.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.960
Right. Yeah.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.480
Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. And even some of the new, what are they, ProRes displays,

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:09.320
like the new MacBooks and stuff? Like the entire display will slow down if stuff is not happening.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:15.160
And I wonder if maybe if you had a GUI app that was refreshing the screen a lot, maybe it would

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.800
prevent it from actually going into a slower mode.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.800
Look and do that. Variable refresh rate plays into the software actually rendering.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:27.080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't really work at that level, so I don't really know for sure, but all in the same

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.920
space, I'm going to go back to the app. This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Sentry.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.560
How would you like to remove a little stress from your life? Do you worry that users may be

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:43.720
encountering errors, slowdowns, or crashes with your app right now? Would you even know it until they

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.360
sent you that support email? How much better would it be to have the error or performance details

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.960
immediately sent to you, including the call stack and values of local variables and the active user

00:16:53.960 --> 00:17:00.600
recorded in the report? With Sentry, this is not only possible, it's simple. In fact, we use Sentry on

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:06.680
all the Talk Python web properties. We've actually fixed a bug triggered by a user and had the upgrade

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.040
ready to roll out as we got the support email. That was a great email to write back. Hey, we already saw

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:18.280
your error and have already rolled out the fix. Imagine their surprise. Surprise and delight your users.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:50.840
It looks to me like that some of the, there's some similarities from the I am GUI in terms of the

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:56.680
UI look and feel, but then you've got the retained mode versus immediate mode and things like that.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.800
What's the relationship between these? I'm GUI itself.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.920
I'm GUI itself just outputs. You can read as read me, but outputs and optimize vertex buffer.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:10.280
It sends basically the coordinates and everything needed to draw the UI, but it is up to you to take

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:16.440
that and actually do something with it and render it. We use that. We use I'm GUI to basically create

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.160
those vertex buffers. As far as the retain mode stuff, originally we were doing more of a one-to-one

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:29.720
wrapping with that library. And we started to hit some performance issues with Python itself, just because

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.840
the second, if you're having to do a lot of conversions between maybe the Python types and

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.200
the C and underlying C types that can slow things down. Also just the GIL gets in the way with a lot

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:46.280
of different. So what we did with the retain mode is we basically just created a barrier between that,

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:52.360
where we do go against the immediate mode style thing. And we have, we do keep up with things like the

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.840
the underlying value is just the floats, the, the ends, the strings, whatever it is.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.960
So it goes back to a more retain mode, which is what every other library is that most Python users would

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:07.320
be used to. The float actually stores a, sorry, an input text has its underlying string and you can

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.480
get that value, set that value.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:15.640
So a lot of UI code, you don't even need to have some variable that holds the thing. You might just

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.080
put it in the button and if you need it back, you could get it from the button potentially. Right.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:25.640
Right. Yep. And that's how it works. So I guess one of the only other things that's neat is underneath it,

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.600
it is just a raw, I'm pretty sure probably using smart pointer and you can actually link a lot of these

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:36.200
widgets together to when they're truly controlling the same value. And you can get some pretty cool effects

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:42.360
with that to where directly moving this slider is updating the plot and there's not some update

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.320
code that's having to happen or any callbacks. It's just that they're truly the same value.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:53.000
And because we're updating 60 times a second, you're able to see those changes live, which is pretty

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.360
neat. And you can create some pretty cool stuff with that. Yeah, that's fantastic. Before we jump into some

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:03.800
of the details, if you visit the GitHub page, which of course I'll link to, let's maybe just talk through

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.720
some of the features. I was going to go to the gallery, but maybe the features is a better place

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.280
to start. And you guys have this engineering background. It feels like a lot of what this

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:19.240
creates and allows us to build real easily has this engineering visualizing aspect to it. Right.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.640
Yeah. Yeah. So maybe talk us through some of the features and things you can do. So for example,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:30.360
one of the things you have, you can see right at the top of the feature section is the I am plot stuff,

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:35.320
which looks like really interactive and dynamic plots and graphs and pie charts and so on.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:43.320
Yeah. It's another immediate mode interface that the guy that wrote it, Evan Peasant, I'm not sure

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.840
how to pronounce his last name, who also happens to be located here in Houston, wrote it on top of

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.800
on GUI and tried to model that immediate mode interface. So again, you get all the same dynamic

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:57.080
features that you get with GUI itself. And that's why you can see on here a lot of the, just how crazy

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:03.480
dynamic it looks, right? With the live QCAP clearing and everything you see there. And obviously we,

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.840
again, built on top of it because we have to go from that immediate mode to retain mode style. And

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:15.400
it, you have multiple axes, you have drag and drop support, custom drag and drop support. There's a lot

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.280
of series you don't see there, candlesticks, shaded series, stem plots.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:27.720
Yeah. One that looks really good is this one down here that has full zoomed out graph and then a graph

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:34.040
below it that as you pan around and zoom in, you can actually, it's like a high level and then a low

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:39.640
level or zoomed in detail view of what you're exploring there. Yep. And that's pretty obituary

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.840
than the demo. Well, it's actually not technically built in. That's a query region. So you have to

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:50.440
set up another plot with the same. Also, it looks like they have animations and stuff. The one below

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:56.520
it sort of just cruising by without any interaction. So are you able to just feed it live data and it just

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:02.120
keeps refreshing 60 frames a second or something? Yeah, that's exactly how it's working because it's,

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:07.800
again, already updating 60 times a second. All you're doing is changing the data and it just by

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.280
default, you basically get an animation. If the data changes, it's going to re-render it no matter

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:18.040
what. And so then it gets a different picture, right? Yep. It's worth noting that it's only 60 frames a

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.680
second. If you, if you use VSync with your, with your screen, it actually runs as fast as your screen

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.640
can run. So 144 to whatever hertz your monitor is on. Oh, interesting.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:33.320
It depends on your GPU and everything else. Yeah. We'll control the render loop so you can actually

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.560
slow it to whatever exact frame resolution you want. You could 30, whatever you want. Right. You

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:43.400
probably can't exceed your monitor, but you could slow it down or do something if you need to chill it out.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.440
You can, it just won't.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:50.440
The effect of, the effect of people seeing it, they won't see it. Right. Yeah. And that, yeah,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.080
that's really cool. Cross platform. Yeah, it is cross platform, but I was going back there. There are

00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:00.760
some cases where we will turn VSync off to just test how fast certain things are happening. Right.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.000
Because you want to know what's the performance upper limit of this, regardless of the screen.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.920
the screen. And a lot of people love to send us messages with that while we're trying to do

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.360
something like update a texture or something as fast as they can and trying to get 300 or 400 frames a

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:19.160
second. But it was pretty neat to see that. What else should I highlight in here? These are all,

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.840
there's a bunch of graphs. I think people really just need to go see them, but there's,

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:29.000
there's nice heat map looking things. There's some statistical stuff. Anything else you want to shout out on the.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.800
Yeah, there's some candlesticks. We've seen some great interaction with some APIs through some actual

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.520
cryptocurrency interfaces people have done. They made crypto wallets, which is pretty cool. We've seen some of that.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.520
Right. Yeah. So we've seen probably maybe 10 of those. So it is a lot of people seem interested in that.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.480
Interesting. Yeah. So people are using

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:51.320
DearPyGUI to build something like a dashboard trader application.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.760
A lot of dashboards. Yeah.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:58.280
We can pull in a comment from the audience, Mr. Hypermagnetic. Hey, good to see you again.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.640
I've always been curious why not use HTML for desktop GUIs. And then also adds that these are

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.720
definitely nice looking graphs and user interface, which is cool. Maybe I'll let you all take a shot

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.040
at answering that question for you. If you got that, if not, I could throw something out there as well.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.520
Because we got a ton of Electron apps that fit that realm.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.880
That's what I was going to bring up with Electron.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:24.760
And VS Code and other things, Slack and whatnot. I think there's a couple areas that you would care

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:31.080
about. One is you probably are not going to be getting 300 frames a second refresh rate with HTML.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:37.400
There's a lot of layers in there. If you want to take advantage of the GPUs in like deep ways,

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.600
if you want to push a mesh of objects in there and then have them re-rendered, that's not really what

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:48.920
HTML is for. The native integration also gets tricky. I don't know about Geopie GUI,

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.960
but you want to integrate with the menu bar and other stuff, right?

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:59.560
Yeah, we need the hardware access. Now you can use WebGL, but basically you'd be using HTML just to

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:05.320
create that GL canvas. And then after that, it's the same thing as what we're doing now. So you could

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:10.840
do that. I think we have some sample projects where we use that. You can get 60 frames a second higher,

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.480
but again, you're just using HTML just to get to the canvas. And then after that, the HTML is gone.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.840
Yeah, you'd use it for anything.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:24.920
Let me see here if I can get a quick read on say like VS Code here. Hold on. A little activity monitor

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.320
doesn't.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:32.440
If I happen to run through the browser, there's your text stat becomes considerably deeper when we're

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.960
trying to be as light as possible.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.800
Yeah. Yeah. If you want to do a lot of the stuff that we're seeing on the screen here,

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.680
you're almost down to rendering directly on canvas. And then at that point, there's not a huge value

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:48.200
for the HTML side of thing because you're just drawing pixels anyway. So to wrap that up,

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:54.120
I'm a trap hypermagnetic says I've seen performance issues with electron versus more native apps.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.560
Antonio out there. Hey, Antonio. Good to see you. Loves these plotting features. He's also in the oil

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:06.200
and gas industry. So very, very cool. Great. And following up on that, John says there's also a

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.640
limitation to threading and concurrency, which you definitely have more control, right? Very quickly.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:16.200
So for example, like I just launched VS Code and it's doing nothing. And there's one,

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:22.200
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 processes running VS Code, which quick math

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:28.040
across those looks like something like 350 megs of RAM. I don't know what your pipe would take,

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.280
but I suspect it would be far lower than that.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.160
It should be much lower.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:37.720
So you're multi-processing and so on. It's pretty neat. Although Python itself is not known for its

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.680
massive, taking advantage of multi-core stuff because of the deal. Still, you got a little

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.160
more flexibility. Cool. It's always interesting to think about. Now, let's see, let's scroll down and

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:53.560
look through a few more of these pictures here. So you've got this node editor and this node sounds like

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.120
a core thing in this UI framework.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:03.320
Yeah. That's another one of those libraries that somebody had built on top of GUI. It's usually

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.880
just a single file and a pretty light. A lot of people made some really cool stuff with that

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:12.280
because you could put any widget that's in the UI library in these nodes.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.280
So let me take a shot at trying to describe what this looks like for people listening.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.760
You can check out under node editor on the GitHub page. It almost looks like a database diagram

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.480
where you've got relationships between these nodes. But instead of just having table info,

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:31.240
you've got graphs, you've got XY values, you've got other little bits of computation and stuff that are

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.800
visually in the nodes that are also connected together. That looks pretty cool.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.760
Kind of like a data flow thing, which is an actual picture you're looking at. It is a tool we built here

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:46.200
at work to prototype some of the systems that we're working on here. We took a little piece of that as

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.080
a snapshot. But yeah, it's a pretty cool feature. A lot of people do a lot of cool things with it.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:58.760
So it was the idea I could build a little section that will take in some, let's say, fluid flow rate and then

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.320
apply some algorithm and visualize that. But then it also is an output value that can be flow

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:09.480
passed on to some other simulate part of a simulation that's also showing up there and stuff. Is that my understanding?

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:14.680
Yeah, that's it. And you can redirect the inputs from one to the output of the other

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:24.280
or whatever widget that are being connected, whether it be a slider and input or radio box, any of those.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:29.160
And it's a pretty low level. Some of this stuff can be a little bit misleading when you look at it and

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:35.000
it looks like it should just come around out of the box. And most of these are not. For instance, the this node editor that you're looking at

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.840
in general, you create these nodes. And when a user tries to grab one of the pins and link it to another one,

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:46.360
another one, the callback is ran and it's up to the actual user to decide whether to make that link

00:28:46.360 --> 00:29:01.800
where it's given information about where it came from, where it's trying to connect. So it's really up to the user to make something with it. It's pretty low level. And you'll notice that with a lot of these, even in the plots, they're low level. And it's meant for the user to wrap on top of and build more complex.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.360
I don't know. Because we want it to be as generic as possible.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:11.400
There's an example of Tetris, like who doesn't love Tetris, of course. What is this last one here? Several tools to help developers.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.000
There's a lot of built in tools.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.840
As far as it's like tab, tab views and list views and stuff like that. Or what are we talking about?

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:35.000
As an example, like you create whenever you go to create the UI, you may create a window and then add a group and then a collapsing header and then a button. And you have this parent relationship. One of the tools is the item registry. And when if you just type in the command show item registry,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:46.440
you get this basically tree view where you can look through all the items in your UI, click on it, see information about the state of it. Is it visible? Is it clicked on? Is it hovered? That's one of them.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.280
Most of these use for debugging.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.080
Yeah, it's mostly.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.240
Yeah, it's tricky to get a view into that kind of stuff in the UI, right?

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:53.800
Right.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:30:01.960
Obviously, you can print out something or set a breakpoint and see it. But a lot of times they're hierarchical and whatnot. And the right visualization of that makes a big difference.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:18.680
Another great one is to say, if you're loading a texture or a couple of textures into the texture registry, preparing them to be added to a widget, you can use the texture registry viewer to actually go in and inspect your different resources. Like you can preview it before you actually use it.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.040
Oh, that's really cool. Yeah.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.320
And with fonts, you can inspect fonts and other things like that.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:29.320
Is DeerPy GUI primarily focused on 2D UIs? Or does it have a 3D component?

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:35.160
Right. So we are currently it's 2D, but we are working on a 3D engine to go with it.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:43.720
But the UI won't be 3D, but there will be 3D widgets and we can have support for that now, but it's not hardware accelerated. The actual 3D engine we're working on will be.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:54.280
Yeah, cool. So for example, like all these charts that are on the GitHub page that are active and moving, like I can totally imagine that one of it is spherical or it's, it's modeling.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:31:00.120
You know, it's spikes that represent peaks of some kind of measurement all over the place and you want to look at it from different directions and whatnot.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:09.960
Yeah. And I think at the bottom of the readme you can see some examples of users that have already skipped ahead and hacked into some 3D work.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:24.520
Yeah. Like there's a gallery section that people should check out. One of the things I really like to do when I hear about a new UI framework or some tool that does UI graphical stuff is to just go look at the screenshots and go, what I want my app to look like this.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:37.800
Maybe that looks pretty cool. Let me take the time to learn it. Honestly, it blows my mind. There's a lot of UI frameworks out there that don't have a single screenshot of what your whole job is to build pictures. Show us some pictures.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.040
Yeah, really important gallery part of it.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:51.400
Yeah, the gallery is looking really good. So one, it looks like almost the first one is almost like an AutoCAD thing. It looks like some kind of turbine or something is there. Maybe you know more about it. You guys can see them.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:32:02.260
One of the users made it wasn't sure what they were working on. We helped them a little bit with getting access to the underlying OpenGL context because that was on Linux, but not sure what they were working on past that.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:12.440
This next one looks like some kind of modeling system. Another one of those user saw a user with it. We snapped the photo and again, no idea what they were doing with it. Just looked cool.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:21.280
Definitely looks cool. Bunch of left-hand side, right-hand side elements here. Almost looks like it could be modeling some sort of machine learning thing, but I don't think so.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.620
Yeah, definitely some kind of interesting model here.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.620
It might have been.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:38.680
Some really nice visualizers here for, it looks like maybe looking at some astronomy stuff, which is great. And then a game and some more drawing tools. Yeah, here is this maybe a ray tracing?

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:47.560
No, that was just a Phong, just a Phong render that we're working on when testing some of the earlier versions of the 3D engine we're working on.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:48.560
Mm-hmm. Okay.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:33:00.280
So that's just some of the early prototypes. And we thought it was a pretty neat picture to do. And you can do that now if you just kind of, like that other user did, just hack in and get access to the OpenGL context or GrimDirect tags.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:18.840
Okay, so one of the things it sounds like you can do is work with your PyGUI, but when maybe there's some low-level thing you need to do, like a shader context or some weird graphical thing, if it's not directly supported, you can just go, all right, let me just get straight to the OpenGL context object.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.080
All right.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:37.740
That's correct. And for now, that's the way it's done. But one of the things that we've been working on, and a lot of the users have been around a while and know this is, like I said, right now, the backends are Windows, we're using DirectX 11.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:49.180
We're Linux, we're using OpenGL, and for Mac, we're using Metal. That was early on, that was probably a bad decision. So now we've been working on replacing the backend with Vulkan across the board.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:34:02.860
And part of that would be that we'd be able to directly support giving users access to the GPU there. Because one of the things with the library is we do want it to be cross-platform and not have to change the code, pretty much not have to change the code at all across the platform.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:02.860
Right.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:14.000
Right now, with us using different backends, we wanted to expose access to compute shaders. But when you're on Windows, you'd have to write in HLSL. When you're in Mac, you'd have to write it in whatever the language is, Metal.

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:31.920
And then in OpenGLSL. So by switching to the Vulkan backend, we're going to be able to expose that and use the same thing across the board. And that's part of one of the big things that we've been working on. And it's taking a lot of time, but in the 3D engine itself is also going to be written in Vulkan.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.080
I see pictures of that too, by the way, on the...

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.660
Okay, where do I find those?

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.160
Go to the very top. You might have to actually click on my name, but it's dp3d.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.580
Oh, got it, got it. Okay, so it's a separate repo up there.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.140
It will be combined. It's just while we're prototyping.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.540
Sure, sure. Right here.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:52.680
And by the way, nice GitHub profile. Your nice readme looks good.

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:57.520
Yeah, here you go. So the DeerPy GUI 3D engine. Pretty neat.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.840
Oh, look at that. Yeah, you do have some cool pictures in here.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.080
That will be...

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.920
And that's the stuff you need, true 3D stuff.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.320
Yeah, that's true 3D, real time.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:11.380
Let's go back just for a minute on this cross-platform business, because I think this is worth thinking about.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:17.620
First of all, I was really impressed that you had support for DirectX and Metal and OpenGL,

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:23.640
because that means on Windows, you get the best option there, which is DirectX.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:30.680
On macOS, especially in the new Apple Silicon ones, if you want to take advantage of the GPUs that are built in there,

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.820
the best way to do that is Metal and so on.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.280
But yeah, those APIs are super different.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:42.480
So if you're going to expose them, say, here, let me just hand you the low-level context and talk straight to it.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:50.240
Well, setting them up for getting locked into one or the other, plus also having to learn Metal and or learn DirectX and all that, right?

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.620
And again, that's part of the reason we are switching to Vulkan.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.620
We will leave those backends as legacy.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.700
Legacy is a bad word, but you'll be able to switch to those backends.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:04.380
But if you're really wanting to do the low-level stuff and wanting to access the 3D engine, you will have to use Vulkan.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.520
Yeah, so tell people about what this Vulkan thing is.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:13.340
I've heard of it as a way to have one API that talks both DirectX and Metal and OpenGL or something like that.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.940
Is that sort of the deal?

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:20.360
OpenGL, DirectX 11, and I guess that's the two main ones.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:27.960
The older, I guess the previous generation graphics APIs, and those are used to, they go through the driver and they talk to your GPU directly.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:36.540
Like I said earlier on in this, that basically the hardware has changed considerably since those APIs were designed.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.680
Very, very different.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:45.240
So it's a lot more work on the driver developers to have to go from, here's how the hardware works, to here's the API we had.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:55.720
So the move over the last five or six years has been towards these lower-level graphics APIs like Metal, DirectX 12, and Vulkan.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.280
And these are considerably lower-level.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:04.800
Just as an example, to get a triangle on the screen in DirectX 11, it's maybe 300 lines of code.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.600
In OpenGL, it's maybe 100, if that.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.240
To do it in Vulkan, you're easily at 1,000, just getting a triangle on the screen.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:11.660
Really?

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.580
I was already feeling bad that it was 300 in DirectX.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.820
And I can just remember the OpenGL code.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.940
Set the scale.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.060
Set the transform.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.580
Set the viewport.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.120
All of those things.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.900
It's not easy programming type of work.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.860
So Vulkan is even lower than that, huh?

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.500
Right.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.000
Vulkan and DirectX 12 are really your lowest level.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.460
But DirectX 12 is just Windows.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:40.980
And with these APIs, you're able to utilize so much more in terms of what your GPU is capable of.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.860
But you have to manage a lot more.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:47.860
And that's part of why even the 3D engine and that switch in the back end is taking as long as it is.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:52.060
Because the driver developers do a lot less for those APIs.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:57.960
As an example, in DirectX and OpenGL, you can say I need a texture and load it with data.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.400
And that's it.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.460
And you can do it as many times as you want.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:04.940
And Vulkan and DirectX 12, there's a max number of times you can do that.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.020
I think the low number is maybe 4,000 allocations.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:15.980
So it's up to you to instead allocate one big block, manage it yourself, and not keep doing that, as an example.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:21.840
Right. You end up with those sort of maps, right, where this square is the actual whole picture or something else.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:28.520
But to the right of it might be some other thing that you load all into one texture and you viewport into it or something.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.060
Yeah.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.920
Yeah, that doesn't sound fun.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:35.460
It could be fun, but also you pull your hair out.

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:43.140
Another one of the things that the new APIs have changed is actually having to synchronize between the GPU and CPU and DirectX and OpenGL.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:51.220
When you swap the buffers, execute this draw, whatever you're doing, your main loop where you're doing that, you don't have to wait until it's finished.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.700
It's automatically synchronized between the GPU and CPU.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.020
I see.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.080
With the new APIs, that's not the case.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:03.620
You typically, you have to actually add in barriers and fences between the different operations and just a lot of stuff.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.540
You typically have more than one frame processing at a time.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:12.200
You can actually utilize multiprocessing, which is a problem right now with Python because of the GIL.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.600
So even though Vulcan has that, you can't really utilize it yet.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.920
Maybe the no GIL stuff will gain traction in it.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.040
It won't be a problem anymore.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.260
One can hope.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:26.760
So when I'm looking at this Vulcan page here, I see Windows, Switch, Stadia, Linux, Android.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.320
I don't see macOS.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.240
Is it still support Mac or what's the story there?

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:38.720
So the Molten VK is a layer on top of metal so that you can use it for Mac.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.140
It's not directly supported.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.280
You know how Apple is.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.720
You got to use Objective-C.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.200
They don't want you using C++.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.180
It's not as supported.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.260
It's the same thing.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.560
They deprecated OpenGL.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.760
And as of right now, there is no direct support for Vulcan.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.900
So Molten VK is the...

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.700
See, it's like an intermediate layer between metal and Vulcan.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.320
Right.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.280
Talk about possibly leaving metal in.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.700
Yeah, we...

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.460
As a support.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.940
It's a possibility too.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:03.980
Leaving...

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.280
It breaks your perfect abstraction though.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:06.880
Yes.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.220
Right.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.120
What are you going to do though?

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:09.980
Pretty cool.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.360
Metal's already doing that right now.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.720
Some of the formats for the textures aren't supported.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.180
That's a good point.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:15.940
It's a little annoying.

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:16.680
Yeah.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.440
Everyone's a snowflake over in the Mac world.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.360
That is correct.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.300
As I say on my Mac.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:21.560
Okay.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.180
Let's see.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:27.700
One of the things I liked when I was looking through here is you've got a nice getting started tutorial.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:32.360
Maybe we could talk just a little bit about just what the code looks like to get some stuff on the screen.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.960
But you also have some video tutorials.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.440
Jonathan, I know you put some of these together.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.720
A while back.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.840
They're a little outdated.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.340
They're 06.

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.280
06.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.140
Which is pretty old.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.120
But we need to recreate them soon.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.100
As someone who creates a bunch of videos.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.400
They're very tricky to keep them in sync.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.700
You can't just edit a few words or change a thing here.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.800
It's different.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:55.440
But yeah.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:05.500
So people want to learn through the video style they can go through and watch some of these and get a sense of simple plotting or working with tabs and stuff like that.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:05.680
Right?

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.220
Mm-hmm.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:06.640
Yeah.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.240
Most of the things are there.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.060
Documentation still is a bit.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:13.780
But with video tutorials and our read mirror, it's still a little bit lacking.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.820
There's still some stuff that's undocumented that we're having to add.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:23.640
But that's part of the point of the demo is you can see how all those, you know, most of the features are there and you can see how to code them.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.080
Yeah.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.180
But that's no excuse.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.340
That's for us not in doing it for the docs.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:58.460
I went to Toptal to hire a solid developer at a fair rate to help create those mobile apps.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.860
It was a great experience and I can totally recommend working with them.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:07.320
I met with a specialist who helped figure out my goals and technical skills that were required for the project.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.600
Then they did all the work to find just the right person.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:13.200
I had short interviews with two folks.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.360
I hired the second one and we released our apps just two months later.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:25.620
If you'd like to do something similar, please visit talkpython.fm/Toptal and click that hire top talent button.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:27.560
It really helps support the show.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.160
That's true.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.120
That's true.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:35.300
But also contributing to the docs and contributing to a tutorial or something like that.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.460
That's also a good way for people to contribute.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.200
That's a very good way.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.820
Are you all open to having contributors and PRs and other things along those lines?

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:44.180
Apps.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:44.980
Yeah.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.300
I had a bunch of PRs and welcome to join the Discord.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.580
We're in there all the time talking to people about when they're working on different spots in the API.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:59.200
The problem is, you know, most of the users are Python users and libraries written in C and Objective-C and things like that.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.320
So it's just a little bit of a disconnect there where a lot of users would like to help.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.280
And when they go over to the library and see it's that, they go, oh, right.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:06.880
You know what?

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.400
Actually, I wanted to work on a Python project.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.500
We have this problem in a lot of the very popular places.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.640
People want to contribute to Python itself.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.060
And often that means C, not Python.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.380
And darn it.

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.080
People want to contribute to Jupyter.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:23.280
But a lot of times that means JavaScript, not Python.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.360
Like, oh, come on.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.880
But yeah, that's kind of what it means to build tools sometimes.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.640
You guys have the demo fired up on your screen here.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:36.560
Maybe you want to just talk us through a couple of the highlights and how we get this thing going.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.300
Sure.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.540
Got to keep in mind that not everyone can see what we're seeing.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.600
So you can see the demo.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:48.920
And we modeled this after GUI's demo and some of the other demos we saw of people doing similar things where you can see all the different features.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.940
So if I pip install DeerPyGUI, is there just a command I run to just get this going?

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.460
It's one of the modules.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.220
You have import DeerPyGUI.deerPyGUI.

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.240
And then you have import DeerPyGUI.demo.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.720
And there's just one command show demo.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.920
So you could even do that from a REPL if you wanted, right?

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:05.860
Yeah, you can.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.280
And do that right away.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.280
So you can kind of see a lot of different widgets.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.580
Just your typical UI widgets that you have.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.740
Yeah, go back to the widgets real quick for a sec.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:14.360
Yeah.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.780
So you've got a lot of nice ones.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:16.920
You've got buttons.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.160
You've got checkboxes.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.840
You've got radio buttons.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.400
You know, like you can only select one versus checkboxes.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:28.940
You've got drop-down combo boxes, text, text with placeholder hint, I guess.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:35.000
One of the areas that you have a lot of UIs around is the slider, what do you call them?

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.360
Slider float, slider ints.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:41.000
It's like a thing that has a number, but then as you slot, you can not just type in it, but

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.900
you can drag it around and actually scale it.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:47.460
I see this a lot in the Adobe Tools Audition.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.880
You can go on if you want to change something.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:54.100
You can click on a number and just move the mouse instead of typing to the number.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:58.940
There was a lot of these other things because, again, this is really meant for a lot of 3D

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.480
engines and content creation.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.020
A lot of color maps and things like that.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.340
Let's see what else.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.040
Text input, a lot of stuff here.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.660
And remember, I told you a lot of the back ends are the same exact numbers, so you can get

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.040
things automatically like this.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.200
All of these are linked together.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:13.780
All right.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.660
So what you're doing, there's like three text boxes, one that's plain text and two that

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:19.700
are passwords.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:23.680
And as you type in one, they all, it's not real practical for passwords, but as you type

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.620
in one, it'll show you in the different locations.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:29.020
So we're showing different flags, just different flags.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:29.420
Yeah.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.100
How do you create that binding between them?

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:31.780
Is that...

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:32.680
Well, that's what I'll tell you.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.040
There is no actual binding.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.040
They're truly the same value underneath.

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:40.760
Whenever you go to create this, let's say you call this item password one.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.900
And when you go to create the second one, you can specify a source as password one, and

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:49.160
it will just, rather than have its own value, it will just truly use a pointer to the other

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:49.400
one.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.640
And that's why all these...

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:50.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:51.380
That's really cool.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.960
So that's how they stay in sync is...

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.140
Yeah.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.800
Because they just, they are the same data.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.620
Yeah, exactly.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:55.980
It's free.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.740
It doesn't cost anything.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.100
There's no callback that has to run.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:02.940
A lot of basic, simple plots for just pretty simple stuff.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:03.580
Let's see.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.340
Again, these are linked in the same way.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:05.900
Okay.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:06.400
Yeah.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:06.680
Yeah.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.080
Yeah.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.680
So I encourage people, if they want to think about this framework,

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:16.580
is create a virtual environment, pip install Geopi GUI, and then do the import command to

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:17.060
run the demo.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:17.760
Yeah.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.700
Yeah, really.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.040
Date pickers.

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.420
But some of the cooler ones that, you know, you want to see, I mean, I can show these.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.600
These are all pretty typical on most UI libraries.

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.240
I don't know.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.380
Some of the ones...

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.180
That's on the knobs.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:28.920
That's true.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:33.280
Some of the ones, I guess, we have a table API, which...

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.380
Oh, that's nice looking.

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.540
Pretty cool.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.020
You're able to...

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.520
These examples are just showing text, but you can put any widget.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:40.420
You can put plots.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.320
You can do all kinds of stuff.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:46.620
So, yeah, with the table one, probably, if people think about it, like, it probably would

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.380
be called a grid in a lot of frameworks.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:53.700
It's kind of a read-only Excel type of view, but very colorful and nice.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:54.180
These aren't read-only.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.400
These can be any widget you want.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.380
They're more layout.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:00.700
Oh, so you can put, like, a graph in one of the cells?

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.580
Yeah, you can put a plot.

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:02.720
You can put a node editor.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.620
You can put anything you want in these.

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:08.880
It's best to think about a table as more or less a layout, essentially just giving you

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.740
columns of rows where you can put anything in it.

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.200
Oh, yeah.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:11.480
Okay.

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.080
That makes sense.

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:12.580
Yeah.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.260
And you can see here, this sorting one, you can kind of see.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.720
You've got a checkbox in here.

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.960
I think there's an input at different things.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.840
Tables, school, like I said, there's tons of plots.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.520
Yeah, there's lots.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.100
Anyone wants to put in the mouse.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.580
And we have that example that you saw in there.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.120
Oh, yeah.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.920
You even have that detail, high-level and the detail graph in there.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.500
That's cool.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.600
Do you have trees?

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.640
We do.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.000
Stuff with textures and the high-performance flip stuff.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.960
The, for those that haven't seen, where's that?

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:41.920
The node editor.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.540
So, those that are unfamiliar with that, I ran out of room here.

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.160
You know, this is for these node editors.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.220
That node editor is exactly what I expected.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:54.120
So, you've got these three little boxes with different bits of information or graphs, and

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.780
you just drag and connect them.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.800
And, yeah, that's fantastic.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.080
And you can put any widget in the library in these.

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.740
So, it's not limited to just, you know, a small subset.

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:06.100
And then, again, with the drawing API, your typical stuff that you're used to and other

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.980
drawing APIs, being able to draw a line, a box, a cube, things like that.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:16.320
And then, also, some support for a lot of 3D operations, things like perspective divide

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:19.900
and depth clipping and all that to help support these type things.

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:26.660
Let's maybe round out our conversation here by talking a bit about, just give us a sense

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.380
on what it looks like to write some code.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:35.020
So, there's not, I'm guessing there's not a graphical designer type of thing, like Xcode

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.560
storyboard or whatever.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.960
We're not big fans of those.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:38.500
Yeah.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.700
You do this through code.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:39.800
Yeah.

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.620
You build up your UI through code and layout elements.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:42.720
Right.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:48.440
Just give us a sense of how do I get, like, a text box and a button or something on the

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:48.680
screen.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.920
What does the code story look like?

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.800
We talked about the 100 lines of OpenGL or whatever.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.380
So, pretty much every DPG app, you just import DPG.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.760
We do it as DPG most of the time.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:05.440
From there, you'll create a context, which basically sets up the I'm GUI context, sets up

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:09.200
I'm nodes, sets up our internal context with all the different settings and state.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:14.460
Oftentimes, these lower level frameworks, they have to go and get some context from the

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:17.700
graphics card itself and, like, get that from the operating system.

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.040
And I'm sure that kind of wraps that stuff all up.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:20.660
Absolutely.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.400
And then from there, you typically create the viewport.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.200
And again, that's platform specific.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.320
On Win32, we're using Win32.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.080
We're using X11 on Linux.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.600
And on Map, we're using Carriover or whatever it is.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.240
We'll touch that one in about a year.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.320
You got it working.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.180
And there you decided to stay away from it.

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.420
Got it working and walked away from it for a while.

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:42.920
So, the viewport is basically like an empty window?

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:43.440
Right.

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.640
It's your actual operating system window.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.300
Got it.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.680
We call it a viewport.

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.620
And from there, you can create something like a window.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.740
There's these root objects.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:54.040
A window is like the I'm GUI window that you see below.

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.200
The blue window that you would see on a demo, things like that.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.560
floating windows within the main viewport.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.420
From there, to just add something like a text widget, it's dpg add text.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.540
dpg add button.

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.020
dpg add input text.

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.480
Whatever the widget is.

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:16.560
And you can impose the hierarchy of parent-child relationship with context managers kind of the way that you could just use.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:26.780
If I'm going to create a window, one of the windows, one of multiple possible windows, instead of creating a window object and say window add this or that, you would create a context manager and just do a bunch of ads.

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:27.460
Because.

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:28.980
Then it all just goes to that window.

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:29.640
Right.

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:34.440
Again, we're not object oriented, which kind of also sets us apart here.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:39.040
If you weren't using the context manager, that same operation would be dpg add window.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:46.820
And it returns either an ID or you can put the ID in with the keyword tag equals whatever your ID is.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.060
Then you would push to the container stack.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:52.760
And then when you're done adding items, you pop it back off.

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.520
The context manager handles that for you.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:54.880
Right.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.020
So it's adding the window, pushing it and popping it.

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.480
And if you wanted to do something, like I said, it's not object oriented.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.240
So when you do add button, you don't get a button back.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.620
You get a handle to internal button.

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.560
And then you use that handle and you can store it.

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.580
Just say B equals dpg add button.

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:14.720
And then all the various commands, you would use that handle to control it.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.440
If you want to say, get the checked state of a checkbox.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:18.720
Right.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.340
Get value.

00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:20.020
Yeah.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.360
Or configure everything you did when you created it.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.640
When you started off, you can modify later on using configure item.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.320
And then you just pass in that handle and go from there.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:29.800
Cool.

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.520
Is there an event loop type of thing?

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.100
There is.

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:39.220
So after you've created the viewport and you add your widgets, you would do set up Deerpy GUI.

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.000
And what that runs is that starts up the second thread.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:42.840
We have two threads.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.120
We have the rendering thread running.

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.120
And then we have a callback thread where all the Python's at.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.640
So that's what set up Deerpy GUI does.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:54.240
Show viewport actually shows the viewport and starts basically the platform specific event loop.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:56.340
From there, start Deerpy GUI.

00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:57.640
That is your event loop.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:04.660
If you actually want to see the event loop, you would just do while is Deerpy GUI running, render Deerpy GUI frame.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:04.920
Right.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.100
And you could do everything you want inside of there.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.260
And then when you're completely done, you destroy the context.

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:10.540
Looks super straightforward.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:15.280
One thing that I don't see here is the callbacks.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:20.520
So like when the slider slides or the button clicks, is there some way to hook that action?

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.700
Like obviously the save button is going to need some.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:23.940
Yep.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.900
It's a callback.

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.680
It's a keyword for callback.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.060
And basically it can have three arguments.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:32.920
The sender, which will send you the ID of the item that called the callback.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:42.060
The second one is app data, which for us that can be either the value or if the callback's related to window resizing, it'll be the new size.

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.980
It's just data that DPG sends you.

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:51.640
And then the third argument, user data, is user can pretty much put anything they want, then it'll get passed through.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:55.800
And it's useful for a lot of people that are creating OFB wrappings around the library.

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:56.540
Yeah, nice.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:01.520
Is there one callback that handles all the events and then you do like a switch statement?

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.960
It's really up to the user.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:10.860
You can have a different callback for every one or you can have one master callback where you just check the sender and do different operations based on what called the callback.

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:12.560
You have a little bit of freedom there.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:20.140
We do have callbacks you can attach to inputs such as the mouse or the keyboard or the window resize.

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.880
Like you mentioned, we have callbacks to set up.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:26.820
It is nice to be able to say, when this button gets clicked, do this.

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:27.800
And that makes it real simple.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:34.620
But there's also times that you might want to, I want to capture all the button clicks and then do some common thing regardless of which button gets clicked.

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.200
It's nice to have that flexibility to go either way.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.040
That's the biggest thing.

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:44.680
We try to be as flexible as possible and allow really geared towards a lot of people wanting to wrap and create their own kind of interfaces.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.260
So there's a lot of freedom.

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:53.920
So I noticed that you have this, you call it the viewport, this like window that comes out of the operating system.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:57.840
And then the DeerPy GUI windows live in that space.

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.600
Is there a way to simulate it looking almost like the DeerPy GUI window is the whole thing?

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:09.260
Could I not show the title bar of the one window and then maximize the inner window to fill it?

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.140
You can undecorate the viewport.

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:12.560
There are settings for that.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:20.340
And then we have a command that's set primary window and you can basically set one of the, whatever I'm doing, one is the primary one and it'll fill the whole viewport.

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.100
And you get that.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:22.480
But you can't necessarily move them.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.200
When you do that, you can't have multiple viewports at the moment.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.700
We're still working on that.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:30.860
Is there like modal dialogues and that kind of stuff in there?

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:32.440
There is modal dialogues.

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.200
There is file dialogues.

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:39.920
A lot of people still tend to just import to Kenter and use their file dialogue because a lot of people don't like ours.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.540
It's right.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.020
The context menus.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.880
Yeah, it looks great.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:48.420
Like I said, people who are possibly interested should check out the gallery on the GitHub page.

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:51.160
That's a good litmus test of what does it look like if you want to use it?

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.060
I think it looks pretty good.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:52.640
I like it.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:52.800
Sure.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.680
We're getting close to the end here.

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.680
One thing, we talked a lot about the future stuff already.

00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.820
Maybe we don't really need to go into that.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:03.420
We've got the Vulkan backend, the 3D engine and stuff like that.

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:10.480
One of the things that I always want to do with a GUI is put it into my taskbar or put it into my macOS dock.

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:16.980
And I want to be able to give a binary thing to a user and not tell them about virtual environments and pip install and all that.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:21.860
What's the deployment story about giving somebody a distributable version of this app?

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:26.980
So a lot of users have used some of the tools, Pi, Pi 2.

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.220
Like Pi Installer or Pi 2.

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:29.220
Things like that.

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:29.400
Yep.

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:37.560
We did early on when we first started the project, had a batch file and some batch files that packaged it up for you.

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.080
Actually created the executable and everything so we could hand them around here, embedded the Python interpreter and everything.

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:45.540
We did remove those, but we do eventually plan on adding back.

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.260
So we really don't like having dependencies on other libraries.

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.740
So even though you are using that now, we would like to bring back that.

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:52.640
It wouldn't be that hard.

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.460
We already do that.

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:57.500
When we develop it, we are using an embedded version of Python and an executable.

00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.500
We're not actually using this.

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.180
What is it?

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:02.160
This utils.

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.880
And we're not using any of that.

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.960
We're actually just using the Python C API directly and embedding it.

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:20.860
Yeah, just as a sidebar, one of the things I really think would benefit Python as a community is if there was just a built-in Python-M package or build executable or whatever.

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:26.360
And out the other side comes a .app, a binary Linux app, or a .exe.

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.860
And you just hand it out, right?

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:31.860
There's so many scenarios where people would like a tool that they would like to be able to share.

00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:34.260
I feel like it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.060
People aren't doing that very frequently.

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.440
So why do we need that feature?

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.500
Well, they're not doing it because it's so super hard and fragile, right?

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:45.660
If it were as easy as pushing a button, I think maybe people would do it more.

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.340
So I don't know.

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:46.640
Anyway.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.720
Absolutely.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:54.740
That was one of the original reasons for our engineer sandbox project way early on is we did do the tools in Python, but we couldn't hand them to people.

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:57.820
We had to tell them, we got to install Python and then pip install this.

00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.660
So the idea of that one was we were able to just hand them that.

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.740
A little bit wrap up on the audience side.

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:06.720
Mr. Hypermagnetic once again says, very nice design and similar to small JS libraries.

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.140
Yeah.

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:07.640
Nice.

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.040
Appreciate it.

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:08.740
Looks good.

00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:09.620
Last thing.

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:16.080
I always am interested how these projects gain traction, how people find time and energy to put into them.

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:22.160
And one of the ways is for companies that use them or people that use them to sponsor you guys.

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:29.740
So you guys have a sponsor option here, which is part of the GitHub sponsor story, right?

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:30.860
We have GitHub sponsors.

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:37.140
I think that's actually a pretty big deal because it used to just be like, oh, you put a PayPal donate button or something on there, which is fine and all.

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.820
This is an awesome feature that they, I guess, Microsoft added.

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.460
I assume that they're the ones that did it.

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.320
Yeah, it's pretty good.

00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:48.860
We do have the GitHub sponsors open collected and buy me a coffee.

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:49.440
Yeah.

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.860
So this is a part-time project for you guys, not full-time.

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:56.260
It sounds like you're doing mechanical engineering work full-time.

00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:00.920
And then also this both at work, but then also bringing it out to the community a little bit.

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:01.780
That is correct.

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:05.320
If it directly applies to something we're doing at work, a bug or something, we'll add it here.

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:12.120
But for the most part, it is at home at night, you know, after our families are in bed and working on it there.

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.280
A labor of love.

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:13.980
Awesome.

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:14.700
And it's great.

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:19.980
It's great to see more UI frameworks and more UI innovation in the Python space.

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:21.180
So thanks for doing that.

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:25.660
Now, before we get out of here, let me ask you all the final two questions.

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:28.820
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:30.100
Typically PyCharm.

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.800
Yeah, pretty much PyCharm.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.580
And then a notable PyPI package, something you've run across.

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.260
Like, oh, this is awesome.

00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:37.040
People should know about.

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.540
Typically just numpy is about the only one.

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.840
NumPy is about the only one to use.

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.100
We like to reinvent the wheel.

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.160
Viewer dependencies.

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:44.940
Right on.

00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:48.120
Anthony out in the audience says, I'm guessing, question mark.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:54.100
Does DearPython GUI play nicely with third-party libs like Nutka, PyInstaller, and so on?

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:55.700
PyInstaller, I know it does.

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.240
Nutka, I do not believe it does.

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:03.640
And then numpy or anything that supports the buffer protocol, you can use in a lot of our functions.

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.940
Very nice work.

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.220
Final call to action.

00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:10.300
People want to get started with DearPyGUI or maybe give back to it.

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.360
Sorry, and Anthony says, it was a statement, not a question.

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.180
Thanks, Anthony.

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:16.220
Nice.

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.760
Yeah, final call to action.

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.440
People want to get started with DearPyGUI.

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:20.240
What do they do?

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:23.440
Just pip install and run the demo on the readme.

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.120

00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:26.180
There's about a thousand.

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.160
Go through the reason.

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:28.060
Read the docs for sure.

00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:29.000
Read the docs.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.920
Contributing would be nice.

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:34.440
We're still in the middle of refactoring a lot of things internally, so it may be a little

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:34.800
hard.

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:38.560
But other than that, also just sponsoring really helps out, makes it worth it.

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.980
Jonathan, Preston, thanks for being here.

00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:41.980
Appreciate it.

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:42.560
You bet.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.620
