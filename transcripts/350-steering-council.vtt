00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:06.460
For 30 years, Python was overseen by Guido von Rossum since he created and released it back in 1990.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.380
When he retired in 2018, he left the creation of the new governing body up to the core developers.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.160
After a few stressful months, the concept of us steering council became the way forward.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.620
On this episode, I welcome on the outgoing steering council to give us a look back on how this past year has gone.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.660
We have Barry Warsaw, Kara Willing, Brett Cannon, Pablo Galindo, and Thomas Waters on the show.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.840
They're going to give us a rundown on the important decisions of 2021 for the steering council.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.500
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 350, recorded December 14th, 2021.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:56.960
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.680
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.900
Follow me on Twitter where I'm @mkennedy, and keep up with the show and listen to past episodes at talkpython.fm.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.940
And follow the show on Twitter via at Talk Python.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.360
This episode is brought to you by Research Affiliates and Signal Wire.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.480
Please check out what they're offering during their segments.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.840
It really helps support the show.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.000
Hey, everyone.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.700
I just want to give a quick shout out to one of the videos I made in my Python Shorts series since the last time we've spoken.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.920
I released one called Do You Even Need Loops in Python?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.740
If that sounds interesting, really, it's about list comprehensions, isn't it?

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.600
Check it out.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.080
I'll put the link in the show notes.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.720
All right.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.500
Let's talk to the council.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.960
Barry, Thomas, Carol, Brett, and Pablo, welcome all of you to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.580
Thanks, Michael.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.080
Thanks, Michael.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.460
Hey.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.200
Thanks.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.800
It's so good to have you on the show.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.800
Some of you brand new.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.600
Some of you familiar faces, but nice to have you all together.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.500
You're all on the Python Steering Council.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.700
It takes a lot of people to replace Guido.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.420
Is that what I'm hearing?

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.020
Absolutely.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.040
Not even replace.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.760
Just parody.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.160
Yeah, exactly.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.800
There you go.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.200
Fantastic.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.240
Well, I'm really looking forward to talking to you all about it.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.660
Shine a little bit of a light on what the Steering Council does, what you don't do, what your challenges are, and the role, and so on.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.960
But before we do, maybe we can just go around the video version here and have you all introduce yourselves.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.180
You know, start at 12 o'clock.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.820
Barry, you've been on the show before with Paul Everett talking about Python 1984.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.860
Was it 94?

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.620
Yeah.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.940
Yeah.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.520
Yeah.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.220
PyCon 9.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.020
The workshop at NIST in 1994.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.840
Yeah, that was the first time I got a chance to meet Guido.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.700
Right on.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.620
Yeah, so quick background, though, for people who didn't listen to that episode.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.320
Yeah, so I've been working in Python since 94.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.300
Been on the Steering Council since the initial term, I guess.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.140
I currently work for LinkedIn, and I guess that's all I really need to say.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.700
Yeah, what kind of stuff are you doing on LinkedIn?

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.740
I do work with the Python team over LinkedIn.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:11.620
Currently, I'm working on an interesting project that's trying to improve the access to technical documentation to our developers, which is kind of a fun project at times.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.060
Yeah.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.600
I bet it is.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.160
That sounds awesome.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.920
Yeah.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.260
Cool.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.700
Thomas, welcome.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.280
Thank you.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.640
I'm from Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.120
I've worked on Python since, I think, 2000.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.380
I became a core developer in 2001, so I've been around for quite a while.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:40.780
Ned Batchelder, who wrote coverage, likes to call me the most famous Python person you've never heard of because of the things that I implemented in Python that everyone uses that nobody realizes I implemented.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.340
But I'm happy being somewhat anonymous.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:54.080
I work at Google on Python itself, on how we deploy Python internally, and I have a lot of fun with very complex technical solutions that grows Pablo out.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:02.380
And I'm also on the board of directors of the Python Software Foundation, which is a little bit of different work than the Python Steering Council.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.660
And right now, I'm also stepping in for Eva, who left us, decided to move on last week.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.340
So I'm currently the interim general manager while we're looking for the new executive director.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.900
So you have basically four jobs.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.940
You're a busy person.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.440
Yes.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.040
My dad made a lot of fun of me last week when I told him this.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.600
He has two full-time jobs, and he said I do more work than he does.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.100
Sounds like you're busy.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.620
Being from Amsterdam, are you happy the F1 championship is now on there?

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:43.460
I heard fireworks yesterday, but I wasn't actually paying attention because I haven't watched the Formula One for many, many years.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.420
Yeah, right on.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.860
Well, it's another thing to celebrate over there.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.900
Carol, welcome.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.820
Thanks, Michael.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.720
It's always a pleasure to see you.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.860
Yes, you as well.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.740
Happy to have you here.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.980
Much better circumstances.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.380
I think the last time I was on, Brett and I were here right after Guido had resigned.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:07.140
Yeah, to basically explain, what was that, to discuss the possibilities that were being considered for what has now become the Steering Council?

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.840
Absolutely.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.080
So we're in a great place now, I think.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.360
I've been at the Steering Council since the start, and this was my last term.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.540
Right now, I'm not running for re-election.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.040
I feel really strongly, much like I did with the Python Software Foundation, that turnover is good.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:31.880
And so I am right now in the midst of working as a VP of learning for a startup called Notable.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:44.400
And based on the work that I've done in the Jupyter ecosystem and with open science, and so we're creating a collaborative data platform, which helps everyone and teams work well together.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.680
Yeah, that sounds really fun.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.260
Awesome.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
So you don't have any worry about re-election.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.880
You can just vote however you want.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.440
You're unencumbered.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.360
I'm unencumbered, and it's a great slate of people, so I'm really, really pleased at how things have evolved over time.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:08.840
And obviously, these fine folks would be wonderful to be re-elected, but there's also a great group of folks on the slate as well.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.520
So I think we're in good shape.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.300
Yeah, fantastic.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.400
Brett, welcome back.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.340
Thank you very much.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.020
Background.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:21.980
So I'm calling from Vancouver on the unceded traditional lands of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Sailor Truth First Nations.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.400
I'll be right up front on that.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.120
I have been on the steering council since it started.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:38.820
And as for a day job, I am constantly trying to convince Michael to try out VS Code for Python as the manager for the Python extension of VS Code.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.520
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.300
No, good work.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.960
I mean, I've not seen a tool take off with such broad support.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.740
You know, I always ask the question at the end of the show, like, what do you use to write Python these days?

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.000
And nothing has a second derivative as high as VS Code.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.560
Like, the rate of acceleration or adoption is really quite something.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.200
So you should be proud of that.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.620
It's awesome.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.980
Oh, yes.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.280
I'm very proud of the team.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.000
They've done a great job.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.240
Yeah.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.280
And you also now live on an island, right?

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.460
Didn't those storms, like, separate all the roads from the rest of Canada?

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.480
Yeah.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.340
You guys doing all right?

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.720
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:28.400
For those of you who don't know, we had a river of storms, literally, that came through the greater Metro Vancouver area and flooded out every single road in the greater area such that there was literally no land link to the rest of Canada through Canadian land.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.460
You either had to fly out or you had to go down through the states, which also was flooded out near us in the Pacific Northwest.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.920
So it's a thing.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.180
No rail lines either.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.740
The port's completely backed up and we're, like, the third largest in North America here in Vancouver.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.080
So, like, I went to the grocery store yesterday.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.940
The shelves were pretty bare due to just logistical issues.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.160
I mean, I'm in Vancouver.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.780
I'm fine.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.060
It was mainly out.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.020
The poor folks in the Fraser Valley completely flooded out.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.760
Like, we have no clue what it's going to do.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.700
And, like, half of all the dairy and all the chickens for the province come through there.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.360
There's been a lot of, unfortunately, a lot of animals that drowned.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.480
It's really bad.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.680
We'll get through it, unfortunately.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.020
I'm glad you're okay.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.520
That was quite the thing.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.380
Pablo's on a higher note.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:09.620
Hello.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.440
Hopefully.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:10.800
Welcome.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.340
I'm Pablo Galindo.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.320
I've been on the steering council for only this year.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.140
This was the first time serving.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.280
I'm living in the exotic land of London.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.860
And I work at Bloomberg, which is kind of a financial slash news company in the Python infrastructure team.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:36.560
So, we do a very similar thing, as Thomas' team do, but slightly different, I will say, because we need to support all these, not as exciting old systems that banks like to use and whatnot.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:44.640
But we also, like, do a lot of, like, very cool tools, like, you know, the baggers and profilers that we plan to open source soonish.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.500
And we also make sure that Python experience at the company is the better we can.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.020
So, we are in the VEX kind of department after the seventh reorg or something.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.760
So, now we are supposed, like, to take care of that people are happy and whatnot.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.800
And, yeah, people use a lot of VS Code, apparently, as well.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.480
So, I bet they do.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.460
Fantastic.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:12.160
I was just recommending the running Microwizgi in production article from the Bloomberg tech engineering.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:12.820
Oh, right, right.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.100
That's Peter Sperl, I think, is the author.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.160
Like, he, yeah.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.700
Yeah, just last week or something.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.880
That's a really, really neat stuff you guys are doing there.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.500
Right, right, right.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:28.840
And, yeah, and I think the only, in Cpython, I mainly work on the parser and the garbage collector these days.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.360
I've been working, as well, recently on improving error messages all around.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.620
And, kind of, user experience, if you may.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.280
Although, that's a bit of misuse, I think.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:44.220
Yeah, a lot of improvement on the error messages and tracebacks and things like that, right?

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:44.460
Yeah.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.680
People have been more excited than you would expect.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.460
Really?

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.480
When you described that.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.240
I've heard people are like, this is so exciting.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.680
I can't wait to start using this feature.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.780
Yeah, well, we finished the new parser and it's like, well, we can do it this.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:01.160
That is not only, like, more syntax because, like, you know, like, people are like, oh, now we have, like, all this syntax, right?

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:01.960
Like, that's not good.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.000
So, I said, okay, let's make something good so people don't demonize the parser.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.760
So, you know, like, they say, oh, well, the messages are good.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.380
So, let's leave the parser alone, right?

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.040
Exactly.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.920
Yeah, well, nice work.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.460
You're also the release manager, Pablo.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.220
Right, right.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:16.460
Sorry.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.540
Thanks, thanks.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.240
It's a small thing.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:19.940
Thanks, buddy.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.360
Yeah.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:29.700
Yeah, and also the release manager for Python 3.10 and 3.11, which is going to be released this year, late this year.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.920
And, yeah, apparently it's been a very cool release, three times.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.760
So, let's hope that.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.100
Yeah.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.560
I've not noticed any problems and it just rolled out nice and smooth.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.840
Yeah, that's a good sign because it's not that there hasn't been any problems.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.320
But only on the release side.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.020
Once it's released, it's good and well, right?

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:51.580
I mean, I'm also able to do because I have a good team of release managers, all release managers helping me.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.560
So, thanks.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.500
Thanks to all of them.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.160
Yeah, fantastic.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.040
Well, let's just get started with some definitions.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.600
Maybe, Carol, you could also just tell us a little bit of history since you were on the show as well.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.440
Like, what is the steering council and then, you know, where did it come from?

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:06.900
Yeah.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.980
This is a relatively new thing for Python.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.680
It is a relatively new thing.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:17.000
When Guido retired, he left it in the hands of the core developers to come up with a new governance for the language.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:26.960
And so, I'm really proud of the core development team for coming up with several different options for how to organize.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.800
And then we voted as a group after we discussed it all.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.120
And the steering council model was the one that won out.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:52.660
It's five individuals from the Python community, not necessarily core developers, but could be beyond, who are basically entrusted with, by consensus, building the direction and the future for Python, both the language as well as the core development community.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.540
And I think so far, it's worked out really well through three terms.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:11.300
You know, I think we faced a number of different issues and we've done our best to include many different voices and do our best to steward the whole entire ecosystem.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.260
Well, I would say you all have done a great job because I haven't heard anything very much.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.340
You know, it's in the sense that Python is still being released.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.880
Features are still being added to the language.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.680
Maintenance is still being done.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.900
And there wasn't a big disruption when Guido left.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:32.040
And there was a lot of uncertainty because, as you said, he said, all right, I need a break.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.220
I'm stepping back.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.700
I've been doing this for 30 years.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.540
That's a long time.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:41.280
But he didn't want to impose a structure as the person with no skin in the game.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:50.840
Yeah, the entire Python ecosystem, yourself and others, for really rallying around and trying to make everything work.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:57.840
And I can't underestimate Eva's and the Python Software Foundation's impact on that as well for their support.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.260
So I'm glad you haven't heard anything.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.960
I can't say that we've seen the same.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.980
Well, when you're, you know, in the eye of the hurricane, it feels different.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.920
Yeah, totally.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.580
Yeah, or the middle of the hurricane, rather.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.380
Anyone else want to add anything to that?

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.340
Just sort of the historical bits before we get into mechanics?

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.940
I think I want to be fair to Guido.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:25.160
He said, I'm going to give the core developers a chance to self-organize before I decide on a successor or something.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.560
So it wasn't really him saying, you guys figured it out.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.680
It was, I think core developers need to figure out what they want.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.700
And he still is a core developer.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.860
And he was on the first steering council as well.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:42.800
So there was a very deliberate transition of influence, I will say, instead of power.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.360
But if the core developers hadn't figured something out, then I'm pretty sure he would have decided for us.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.500
And I think people would have been, probably would have been happy with that at that point.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:58.820
But I am really glad that we got a working and very effective steering council instead.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.120
Yeah.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.880
I think the thing I'll add is that, you know, over the years, like there was a lot that was sort of underspecified in the steering council spec.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:16.040
And every year we sort of figure out like what the right rhythm of business is, you know, how often we're going to meet, what kinds of agenda we're going to, you know, take on.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.400
That's been really great.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:23.900
You know, it's been great to work with everybody here and everybody in the community to kind of figure out how the steering council is going to work.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.240
And I think we've gotten to a place where it's very effective.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.220
Yeah. And there are other organizations sort of playing in that space.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.020
We have the core developers, right?

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.400
We've got the board of directors, Thomas, you've already mentioned.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.280
And then you've got the steering council.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.100
So where does the steering council fit in there?

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.000
What's the responsibility of the steering council?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.160
Are you overseeing the core developers?

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.500
Do you work with them?

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.760
How does this all fit together?

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.440
So I think PEP 13 does a reasonable job explaining this.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:59.200
The idea is that Hito wasn't, he was called the benevolent dictator, but he wasn't really dictating all that much.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.500
He was basically the final arbiter and he let the core dev community make its decisions.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.080
The benevolent delegator?

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.860
Well, he did push his opinion through when he knew he was right.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.620
And I think history has shown that he was right more often than not.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:19.940
So the core developers are the people with commit bit rights in the GitHub repo.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.140
That's basically it.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.900
It's the people who've contributed a lot to Python of various bits and pieces or overall.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.640
I think everyone there has earned the right to self-organize.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.620
So that's what the steering council is.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.340
But it is still consensus-based.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:41.120
It's still the mandate of the steering council is to figure out what the core developers want.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:48.580
It's not for us to impose our opinion on the core developers unless there is no other way.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:48.860
Yeah.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:58.920
Some organization or somebody has to decide if it's 40, 60% plus and against some idea, somebody's got to go, we're going to do it or not do it.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.800
That used to be Guido.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.540
And now it's you all, right?

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:01.940
Yes.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.300
It's easy when there's a clear answer.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.080
It's easy when everyone's clearly in favor or against something.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:20.560
It is the 40, 60 things, you know, the difficult decisions where we also have to take our time to understand the problem and see how it affects people and carefully make that kind of decision.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.180
Sure.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:29.360
And I'll just point out that the PSF board of directors is not specifically involved with the core developers.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.800
So the PSF is for community work.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.940
It's for fundraising.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.420
It's for the trademarks.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.620
It's the copyright owner.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.760
So it's also for legal things.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:44.100
But the PSF doesn't dictate what direction Python should, the language should be going.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.900
It just talks about the community.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.980
So it's a completely separate concern there.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:55.600
But we did have the executive director, Eva, sit in on our weekly meetings and help us with administration.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.860
And we hired the developer in residence.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:06.160
That is to say that the steering council hired the PSF employee that is Lukash, the developer in residence.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.340
So there is a lot of interaction as well.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:14.900
But it's mostly the steering council using the Python software foundation, I would say.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.120
This portion of Talk Python To Me is sponsored by Research Affiliates.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:26.120
If you're a regular listener to the podcast, then you're passionate about Python and looking for ways to grow your skills.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:31.860
But are you toiling away with Java in your day job only to spend your nights and weekends exploring Python?

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:38.060
Or maybe you are working in Python, but your management puts shipping features over testing and code quality.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:44.720
How does a full-time software engineering job where writing excellent Python is an everyday requirement sound to you?

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.420
That would be your job if you worked at Research Affiliates.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:52.020
Research Affiliates is a California-based leader in investment products.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:59.080
You probably haven't heard of them, but their research and insight powers mutual funds and ETFs that may already be in your 401k.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.560
Their technology group is looking for software engineers with a deep understanding of Python.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:12.380
They are a team of expert Python coders who use Python to write production financial systems, internal Python libraries, and business automation routines.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:18.020
What's more, their team provides ample opportunities for shared learning and professional development.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:26.620
Frequent team code reviews and community engagement through open source contributions and conference attendance are core parts of how their developers work.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:33.240
So if you're looking for a full-time engineering job writing professional Python with a team of friendly and congenial engineers,

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.020

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.420
Carol, it looked like you were going to add something.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:49.580
Yeah, I was just going to say in terms of like the 60-40 decisions, there's been very few of those.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.480
Part of the reason is there isn't consensus.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:19:10.060
What we do is work like, for example, pattern matching was one where we asked the PEP to be reworked several times so that we wound up with a better solution in the end than what we would have if we had just voted yay or nay at the start.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.360
Right.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.120
I think that's an important thing to remember.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.680
Yeah, it helps that all of you are on the technical side of things, right?

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.180
As opposed to overseeing this or whatever, right?

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:28.180
It really helps that you can get in there and say, no, no, no, this is going to have performance implications or this is going to have break and changes or whatever.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.880
And we come at it from different places too.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.280
So that's also an interesting thing that's been, I think, really valuable for us.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:36.660
Yeah.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.140
Yeah.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.880
Carol, you come at it from the science, the data science, scientific side a little bit more.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.920
And Brett comes at it from the editor side.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.640
No, just kidding, Brett.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.200
Fantastic.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.300
When are the elections and then how long do you serve for?

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.160
The elections are right now.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.160
They close, I think, on Wednesday, the 15th of December, anywhere on earth.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.920
Or is it Tuesday, anywhere on earth?

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.660
It's sometime around there.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.120
I think it's Wednesday or something.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.900
Yeah.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.240
Yeah.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.180
And they've been going for the last two weeks.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:14.860
The way it works is when the major Python version is released, so 3.10 in this case, that triggers the elections of the new steering council.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.960
Since we have releases every year, that means we have a new steering council every year.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.320
And we have a single one-year term.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.640
So everyone gets re-elected or not at the end there.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.680
There's a two-week nomination period.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.560
And then we have a two-week sort of discussion period.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.360
And then a two-week vote period.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.540
And so we're nearly at the end of the two-week vote period.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.600
So by Wednesday, Thursday, we should have a new steering council.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:46.140
And as Carol mentioned, Carol's not up for re-election, decided not to go for re-election.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.420
The rest of us is.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.140
We have no idea if we're in the running or not.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.920
I mean, the slate is just really great.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.700
So it could be just five new people entirely, which I would be more than happy with.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.180
More than enough to do as it is.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:20:59.540
Yeah.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:04.700
Do you think it would make sense to have one person stay around as sort of some continuity?

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.800
Or it probably is going to happen just statistically, right?

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.180
I guess we've talked about it.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.180
I mean, that's sort of the nice thing, right?

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.740
It's like we adjust.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.740
Things aren't necessarily set in stone.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:20.140
So for example, when the first steering council was elected, right?

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.680
When Guido retired, we were actually on an 18-month release cycle.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.720
So there was a lot more time between elections.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.920
And now that we're on a yearly release cycle, we've decided to keep the steering council elections

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.460
aligned with Python releases.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.680
It seems to be working okay.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:42.960
And if it doesn't, then we'll have a discussion about that as a community and propose changes.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.920
But so far, so good, right?

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.160
Yeah.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.100
Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:52.360
We used to have Eva as sort of the administrative memory of the steering council, even though I

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:57.080
think there was an overlap of four people at every single past election.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.840
So it didn't really matter.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:04.200
Even though I have taken over some of Eva's duties, if I am not re-elected on the steering

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:10.740
council, I won't be attending as the PSF representative because it just doesn't feel right.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:15.760
But it might be that the next executive director does step up and take that position.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:22.040
So we might have the PSF executive director as the one person who has been in multiple steering

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.500
councils and can transfer over things.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:24.820
Yeah.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.880
And that would give the PSF a seat at the table as well.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.520
It's more about information flowing from the PSF to the steering council than the other direction,

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.860
because the PSF doesn't really involve itself in the steering council things.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.860
But there is the developer in residence, there's money, there's sponsorships.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:46.000
There's a sponsorship benefit to PSF sponsors that they get to have a little chat with the steering

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.620
council, which each steering council has to ratify.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.180
It's not a done deal for the next steering council, but it's just a nice way to have some

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:59.540
connection with the people who care a lot about Python, companies that care a lot about Python.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:05.080
And we also, we do have a handover meeting for the next steering council where we'll have both

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.220
the old steering council members and the new steering council members and make sure that,

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.800
you know, discuss any running issues, anything that the new steering council needs to know.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:19.120
So it's not, even if five new people get elected, it's not that we're just throwing them out,

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.120
you know, in the wild and let them figure it out on their own.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:22.860
We're still there.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.980
We're still part of the community, even if we don't get to reelect.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:25.580
Yeah, true.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.700
You're all still core developers.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.860
They could still reach out to you and ask how about something.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.980
I want to talk about two people really quick while we're, you sort of touched on both of them,

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.320
Thomas.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:45.160
One is just to say thanks to Eva that she's done a lot of work and she's been at it for 10 years or

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:45.780
something like that, right?

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.920
10 years as the secretary or director of operations or executive director of the PSF.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:56.040
She was involved in organizing, or she was organizing PyCon before then.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.100
So she's involved in PyCon even longer than that.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:23:59.340
Yeah.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.480
And for those who are not watching the live stream, pretty much the whole story cancel

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.320
just did a little silent applause.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.760
So we all miss her dearly.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.600
It's only been a week.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.700
Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.700
Best of luck to whatever she's off to do next.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.380
Also, Betsy.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.980
Betsy did a lot as well.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.200
And, you know, thanks.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.520
She's also moved on.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.680
Betsy was assistant secretary, I think, of the PSF and also organizing sponsorships and

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.040
all that.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.980
And so she was involved in a lot of community efforts.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.780
We owe her a lot.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.560
Especially PyCon.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.760
It seemed like she did a lot there.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:33.560
And both of them, so much of what they did was behind the scenes.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.340
And I can't think enough.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:42.960
Their work ethic and how helpful they have been to me and the steering council on so many

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.620
different levels.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:48.880
So we certainly miss them, but we also wish them the best in their next adventures.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.420
Yeah.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.260
All right.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.180
With serious thanks.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.140
I do want to show something I think you all will be amused by.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.620
I don't know if you have you all seen this, this Twitter thread here?

00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.040
Yes.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:05.320
There was a great mention by Patrick Mason saying, hey, the PSF, the at, you know, thus,

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.640
basic, at PSF on Twitter is searching for an executive director.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.620
Here's the job announcement.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.660
Has this been filled yet?

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.160
We're still looking for it.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.640
Well, I mean, the process isn't, oh, we like someone, we're hiring them.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.760
There's a whole search committee and there's resumes to go through.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.980
And then there's, you know, interviews to have.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.380
We're in the process of interviewing a whole bunch of people via the search committee.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:27.540
Okay.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.680
Is it still open for applicants or is it kind of, you have tons and now you're going through

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:32.820
them?

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.780
I think we have really good candidates, but I think more is always welcome.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:42.500
So right up until we decide, especially in December, I think more resumes.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.020
Yeah.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:43.320
Great.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.460
If people want to apply.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.120
Absolutely.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:45.600
Cool.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:45.880
Okay.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.920
I'll put a link in the show notes for that.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.220
But of course, at PSF is the Pacific Salmon Foundation.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:57.760
And they kindly respond at the PSF is looking for an executive director at PSF is not currently

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.160
good luck on your search.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.460
Sorry for the confusion.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.260
And then they responded.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.400
It happens.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.880
We're starting to feel like at the PSF family.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.440
It's not like at Java ever calls broken heart.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.140
I thought that was, that was a good way to respond to it there.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:12.460
Yeah.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:17.120
That was a lot of, but yeah, I think Dustin Ingram, one of the PSF board directors and also

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.720
a Googler got a follow from the Pacific Salmon Foundation, even though he's

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.920
never had a follow from the PSF.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.800
So I thought that was extra funny.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.840
Yeah, that is really funny.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.960
Nice and lighthearted.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:38.880
Now, I also want to ask about the developer in residence and how has Lucas's work helped

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.520
you all out?

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:46.100
I mean, I'm sure Pablo, he was the prior release manager and is also dedicated to helping this

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:46.560
be smooth.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.100
So maybe had an even bigger effect on you.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.740
But what's the developer in residence role interaction with you all?

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:57.740
Yeah, I think, I mean, I think this is one of the things that we are more proud of bootstrapping.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.120
I took a lot of time because we have excellent candidates, all of them.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.140
And, you know, it was not an easy decision.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.580
But I think so far also like Lucas has made an excellent job.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:14.060
So I think one of the things he was working on a lot is trying to help with the review kind

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:14.440
of queue.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.660
That's one of the things he's been putting on a lot of work.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:22.380
is extremely difficult because, you know, like we have a lot of peers and I think he

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.020
has already been on the show before, right?

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:29.440
Yeah, we actually, I interviewed him about specifically about that role.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.920
We probably defer listeners to that particular episode.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.580
But I think that has a lot of impact.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:40.620
But there has been a lot of other places that maybe are a bit less known when he has been

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.100
helping a lot.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:46.160
Like for instance, on the releases, like doing Python releases is quite involved to say in

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.080
some good way.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.620
Is it harder to do a major release, like a 3.9 to 3.10?

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.260
Like 3.10.0?

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.580
Is that harder than 3.10?

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.120
Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:55.580
Yeah.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.760
There is two moments that are especially bad.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:04.800
One of them is the first beta release because what happens is that on the first beta release

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.400
kind of is the point when no new features can be added.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.940
And technically from that point until the final release, it's only back fixes and things like

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:13.460
that.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:18.220
Although people try to stretch the definition of a bug fix quite a lot because there has

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:23.220
always been the strategy of like, I can push maybe this feature like half-baked and then

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:23.920
call it a bug.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.100
And then it's like, oh, I'm doing a bug fix, right?

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.000
So, you know, that's when the role of the release manager, you know, is quite important because

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.660
you need to, I mean, you need to be human.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.940
So sometimes it's like, you know, like people have, you know, they are contributing on their

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:37.320
free time.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.440
So, you know, maybe they tell you, I don't really have time for this, but like, you know,

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:41.740
blah, blah.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.540
So, you know, there is always time for discussions.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.200
But also like you need to be careful with that.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.200
And the other problem that happens is actually, you know, because it's a deadline, everybody

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.740
pushes everything on the last day.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.100
Like, it's like incredible amount of activity.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:02.420
And some of the, you know, systems that we have to check everything, they take a lot of

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:07.000
time to do their checks because they are quite slow checks that take like three, four, five

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.580
hours and I will have to run every unit test for the entire CPython suite and things.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:19.260
It's kind of, we have like a big CI that tests us on like my Windows, macOS and Linux.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:24.020
But then we have like this thing called bill bots that basically machines that are donated

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:29.480
or that we run that test us on like flavors of these platforms or different distributions

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.700
and different versions of macOS, but also like it runs like heavier checks, like sanitizers,

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.720
checks for reference leaks.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.320
So it's these things like that take, like if you put that thing on the CI, everybody will

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.800
help you, like in the sense that it would be ridiculous.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.540
So we have these things and they only, they not don't run on a single commit, they run on

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:47.960
batches.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.660
So basically all commits of the day.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.200
And then if it fails, you know, you need to do some manual bisection.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.100
But anyway, what happens is that, you know, because everybody pushes that and then you

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.360
need to do the release at the end of the day.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.440
You need to kind of wait for these machines to run.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.540
And then what happens is that everything is like extremely, extremely broken.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:10.220
So normally up to this point, it was kind of, it was a bit weird because like technically

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.920
people are, you know, responsible for the things that they break or they push broken.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.520
But at the end of the day, it's kind of like, it's the release manager that finds people to

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:17.880
fix it.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.240
I fixed myself a lot of these things.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.880
And it's very stressful because, you know, like people are waiting for your release and

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.620
it's a quite important release to start testing.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.720
And, you know, like the redistributors are waiting for you because they, they have their

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.380
calendars.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.960
And those nights have been extremely stressful for sure.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.520
I mean, and then three times has been as well, but like the, with the help of Guk, exactly.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.020
We've been coordinating with this.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:48.960
And if not, like for instance, last time we've been like fixing between the two of us, all

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.100
these little things.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.900
Sometimes you need to revert the thing because, you know, it's like, it's so broken that we

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.520
don't have the time to like find out what's going on or like too risky to think like, you

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.980
know, maybe it's fixed, but who knows?

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.400
So, you know, sometimes we just revert.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.560
That would be a bummer if your PR failed through CI and you got to wait a year.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.800
Before it was two years.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.120
Before it was two years.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.200
And, you know, like people don't get happy when, when you push them back your feature.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.560
It was a year and a half.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.620
Yeah, actually.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.280
Almost.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:16.640
Right.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.340
But still, it's quite a long time.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.160
Like, especially if you miss the line because, you know, like.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.940
Well, don't put things off until the last day.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.620
Come on.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:24.900
Yeah.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.260
People don't understand that thing as well as you would think.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.000
Thomas.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.640
Yeah.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.020
Thomas, you can say this.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.260
And then there's the reality of human behavior.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:35.920
Yeah.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.240
I know.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.160
You know, like people get quite angry.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:39.760
But it's good advice.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.480
But in a good way.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.780
I mean, it's not like, you know, they, they, we are all friends here in the court.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.400
And, you know, like it's, it's important to have, I think one of the important parts of

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.160
being a release manager is that you need to have a good kind of communication skills because

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.100
it's not only about like the technical part.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.400
It's also like communicating.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.980
And I think like Lucas in this case has been also doing a very good job.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.420
He, he communicates quite well and especially in tricky situations.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.700
And I think that that is an asset of the, of the position.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.860
Like, you know, you need to interact with a lot of different people in the team.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.720
Like people, sometimes they say, oh, you're paid for this.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.960
So here's all my land release.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.900
And, you know, like you need to also tell them like, no, I mean, we have these priorities

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.280
and whatnot.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:15.640
But yeah.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.700
So, so this has been an area where he has been helping a lot doing releases.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.700
He's still doing releases himself, right?

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.880
Because three nine dot whatever we are now still have it.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.120
So release manager is kind of a long, it's a long serving.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.820
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by SignalWire.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.720
Let's kick this off with a question.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.300
Do you need to add multi-party video calls to your website or app?

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:43.120
I'm talking about live video conference rooms that host 500 active participants, run in the

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:48.140
browser and work within your existing stack and even support 1080p without devouring the

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.840
bandwidth and CPU on your users' devices.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.780
SignalWire offers the APIs, the SDKs and edge networks around the world for building the

00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:01.200
realest of real-time voice and video communication apps with less than 50 milliseconds of latency.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:07.380
Their core products use WebSockets to deliver 300% lower latency than APIs built on REST,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.980
making them ideal for apps where every millisecond of responsiveness makes a difference.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.800
Now, you may wonder how they get 500 active participants in a browser-based app.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.980
Most current approaches use a limited but more economical approach called SFU or Selective

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.280
Forwarding Units, which leaves the work of mixing and decoding all those video and audio

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.240
streams of every participant to each user's device.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:33.980
Browser-based apps built on SFU struggle to support more than 20 interactive participants.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:38.840
So SignalWire mixes all the video and audio feeds on the server and distributes a single

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.700
unified stream back to every participant.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:45.680
So you can build things like live streaming fitness studios where instructors demonstrate every

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.860
move from multiple angles.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:52.000
Or even live shopping apps that highlight the charisma of the presenter and the charisma of

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.780
the products they're pitching at the same time.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:59.060
SignalWire comes from the team behind FreeSwitch, the open-source telecom infrastructure toolkit

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:04.400
used by Amazon, Zoom, and tens of thousands of more to build mass-scale telecom products.

And mention Talk Python To Me for all those credits.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.360
We need to actually find the next release manager for...

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.300
It's a big commitment.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:24.340
Right.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.680
This is about the time that we try to find...

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.820
How do you do that, Barry?

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:33.620
We have a group of former release managers.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.660
We throw around some names and then we find somebody to, I guess, convince.

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.740
They look for someone to volunteer.

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:42.860
Yeah, volunteer.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.940
Yeah, exactly.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:44.500
Exactly.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.940
So we have like a long chain with a big ball at the end.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.680
It's just a finance amount.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.260
We got this present for you.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.560
This is going to be real company.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:58.240
No one will ever approach Benjamin Peterson's tour duty.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.020
Man, that was a bad deal.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.180
That was a bad deal.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.020
Yeah, he was the two-sector release manager.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.340
Yeah, yeah.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.660
He did not sign up for 10 years of bug fix releases.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.940
It's also like people underestimate the work of releasing an operative system.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.880
Sorry, that is a primary language.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.420
Yeah, I cannot imagine releasing a Linux kernel version.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.600
But like it's a multi-hour process.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.300
It's quite a lot.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.560
And, you know, like there is always when people say,

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.820
oh, can't you automate this thing with GitHub actions?

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.100
And it's like, oh, come on.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.520
I mean, good luck.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.280
We have already like a huge amount of automation,

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.320
but there is a lot of processes that are manual.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.800
Like it's ridiculous.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:41.960
Or there is so many ways it can fail and you need manual intervention.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.580
The automating is, I mean, I have something already that for minor release,

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.360
like sort of alpha releases and whatnot,

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.220
which are a bit like, you know, you don't need to build documentation or whatnot.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:55.640
It's almost automatic, even waiting for humans to do things.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.500
But for big ones like betas and final releases,

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.300
it's like five hours of you sitting down.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.740
Yeah, and, you know, there's a lot of problems that happen on the go,

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.740
so it's impossible to do it.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.320
Pablo has also live streamed all this.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.100
So if you really want to see all the effort that goes into it,

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.460
you can, including watching him.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.240
If you go back, watch the ones where he breaks GitHub.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.680
So there's a lot that goes on in those rooms.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.140
Yeah, that's right.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.700
I think I saw you guys all sitting down and live streaming on YouTube.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.780
Yeah, that was a 3.10.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:29.260
It was just Pablo and Rukas and the other managers.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:35.480
Not the steering council, just to make sure the rest of the steering council stays away with him from all that.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.080
We know too well.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.620
You know too well.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:39.440
Fantastic.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.920
I did want to bring it a little bit back to Lukas's work and the developer in residence position,

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:53.640
because it was funded for one year so far by Google because of some money that was lying around.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.840
And, you know, they wanted a good place to donate it.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.600
Eva sold it to them or Dustin sold it to them.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.740
I'm not sure what happened there.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:07.880
I wasn't actually involved myself, but it is something that we need to fundraise for in the future to continue it or maybe expand it.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:14.720
We've already talked amongst ourselves saying we would love to have three developers in residence instead of just the one.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.200
We've had some really good candidates when we hired Lukas.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:23.880
You know, other candidates, I don't know if they'd be in the running, but there's clearly enough interest.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.920
There's clearly enough work as well.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:35.420
Lukas has been focusing a little bit on selling the position as well because he was very aware from the start that, you know, for it to continue, we need more funding.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:44.840
So he's been trying to make the case with his work, make the case that this is a good thing to have and something that people should invest money in,

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:52.320
which is why we have the weekly developer in residence reports that he does, for instance, is to showcase the work and all that.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.600
Yeah, he's very much out in the open about that, right?

00:37:54.660 --> 00:38:02.220
He does his sort of weekly blog and summary of almost the report you would give to a manager, but his managers are the community.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.760
And so it just published that, right?

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.860
In a very real sense, that is the case.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:11.500
I mean, it's not a manager who prioritizes the work because that's us, sort of.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.040
I mean, he does it on his own mostly, but we're there.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.760
But it is the people he is accountable to, the way he feels it.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.020
And I think we all feel it that way.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.840
It's the community work.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:30.980
And he's supposed to be doing the things that need to be done, but that you can't really demand of volunteers that they do.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.600
So I think that's working out fairly well.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:33.880
Yeah.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.120
And it's also the context switching, right?

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.740
Like every one of you has something you've got to work on for your day job.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:50.820
And then to come back and work on a PR or a bug or triage something or help somebody get CPython to compile on their machine so they can contribute.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:58.000
All of those things are better done if you just stay in the flow of, you know, going through the issues and going through stuff.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.500
And he can do that full time, right?

00:38:59.500 --> 00:38:59.760
Yeah.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.240
Well, he has a full time to spend on all of those things.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.820
So he's still context switching a lot.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:05.020
Sure.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.760
But the context is more tightly grouped.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.480
Yeah.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:08.900
Yes.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:09.460
Yeah.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:15.060
And I think it gives you, it gives the language a continuity and sustainability.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.260
You know, people are going to have to onboard and offboard.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.780
We've seen that very much within the pandemic.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:26.680
And it kind of gives us a baseline that things are running as it should be.

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.280
And also he's made a lot of automation improvements as well.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.440
So there's an incremental, like, let's make it better each year.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.120
Yeah, absolutely.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:41.080
How involved or if at all were you, was the steering council in getting a move to GitHub?

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.840
Like the repo or the issues?

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.360
Yeah, the repo, not the issues.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.200
I know the issues are still coming, right?

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.120
They're not there yet, are they?

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:48.680
Yeah.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.180
Yeah.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.520
Working on that still.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:50.980
Yeah.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.380
But the initial get the code over there, get the merging.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.940
I think the steering council didn't exist.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:56.580
Yeah.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.960
I was trying to think about the time.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.360
It just preceded that, didn't it?

00:39:59.360 --> 00:39:59.780
Yeah.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:39:59.840
Yeah.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.700
I mean, Brett actually was very involved into that, if I recall correctly.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.960
But I think what that was.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.160
Yeah.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:11.340
Brett's been involved in every change to our version control system, probably since the

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.440
CVS days.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.720
I was going to make a joke about CVS.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.080
Come on.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:15.440
Yeah.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:15.740
Yeah.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:16.380
Yeah.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:23.700
I don't think I was not involved with CVS to subversion, but everything subsequently I've

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.120
somehow been involved with.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:25.420
Yeah.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:25.700
Yeah.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.840
So how are you happy to see it on GitHub now, Brett?

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.620
Since I'm the one that made that happen, yes.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.800
Well, I mean, you could regret it.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.100
No, I would think so.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.520
No, it seems like it's gone well.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:35.920
Yeah.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.040
It's worked out pretty well, I think.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.560
There were some bumps way back.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:44.720
Like, for instance, I wasn't expecting quite so many core devs who don't contribute to any

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.100
other open source except Python.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:49.680
And thus, they didn't know GitHub and they didn't know Git at all.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:49.980
Yeah.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.020
You completely changed their workflow, right?

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:52.440
Yeah.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.840
So it was one of these things.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.700
It was a learning experience for some people.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.320
And we just had to help them along.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.780
There's a whole doc, I think, might still be there in the dev guard of how to Git for

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.660
Mercurial users.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:02.960
Yeah.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.460
All that.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.440
So it's definitely been great.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.100
And I'm really appreciative that one of the things we've been able to do this year, the

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:13.220
steering council, is we're very close to moving our issue tracker over to GitHub as well.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.460
So there'll be a bit more of a connection between the PRs and the issues.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.100
Yeah, that'd be great.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.900
And we don't want to maintain our own infrastructure anymore, which has always been somewhat of a

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:20.160
burden.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.200
4E has been having to keep bugs.python.org running this whole time.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.920
He's got everything else on his plate that always has to keep up and running.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.420
So, yeah.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.920
But I mean, Marietta, for instance, deserves a lot of the credit for pushing this because

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:35.500
she wrote the original PEP and has always been poking people like, hey, can we still

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:35.800
do this?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.580
Because it's still happening.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.220
What's going on?

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:43.260
And thanks to the PSF for getting the money together through GitHub's donations to make sure that

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.920
this happens and coordinating all that money and all that hiring.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.100
And so we're able to have, let's say, it was a core dev work on this.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:53.340
And we've been kind of project managing it towards the end on this to get over the fish

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.580
line, but looking good.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:59.200
And the goal now is hopefully January sometime we'll be flipping the switch and moving over.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:41:59.480
Yeah.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.580
Well, that's coming up quick.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:00.940
Yep.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.120
Yeah.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.820
I think that's sort of like, you know, an underappreciated perhaps contribution to Python,

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.300
right?

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:11.500
It's like Marietta has done an amazing amount of work and Brett's done a lot of this as well

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:16.920
as to make those kind of like GitHub workflows really natural and easy to use.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:21.500
So there's lots of people who contribute to Python in ways that are maybe not quite as

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.740
obvious as what the steering council does, but are just as important.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:30.100
It's not more important for making the whole experience of developing Python really smooth

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.140
and easy to do.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:31.740
Yeah.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:37.380
I think also kind of nowadays there is more and more people are conscious of this, but

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:42.500
I think there is also like a special emphasis on like when you contribute this code, right?

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:47.500
Like, like, and then even like people feel that or they have been like doing documentation

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.840
contributions or even like CI contributions or whatever.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.500
like, and they say like, Oh, I didn't continue to see Python.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.440
I mean, come on.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.640
Like, you know, it's important for, for us to highlight this.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.240
And, you know, there is a lot of, even code developers, there is a lot of code developers

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.300
that don't continue code.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:07.180
Like even just, you know, try adding and all those things that those are as important or

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:07.760
even more.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.980
Like, you know, code is, is not a small part, but it's also by far not the full picture.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.260
Right.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.300
Like, even if you take Guka's work, right?

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.420
Like he's not coding that much as the developer in racing.

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.440
I mean, he does some coding, right?

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.400
But like, and that you see the impact that he's having, right?

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.920
Like literally we are, we are searching for someone who, who does that kind of work because

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.380
he's needed.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.800
No, we are not searching for an excellent coder, right?

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.420
Like we already have a lot of those.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:35.080
So, you know, like, I think it's important to highlight and I would like to take the time

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:40.080
to say here that, that when, when people think about contributing, you know, you don't

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:40.980
need to think about code.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:41.260
Right.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.600
You don't have to master pointers to pointers, you know, void pointers.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.300
You know, there is a lot of, there's a lot of ways to contribute.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:47.520
Yeah.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.540
And you know, there is a lot of people that go and it's always the same thing, right?

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:55.900
I mentor, I'm spending a lot of time mentoring new core developers, like the last four core

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:59.040
developers were people that I helped mentoring myself or partially.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.920
And, you know, it always happens.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:05.260
I mean, I've been also very lucky and like the last core developers that I've been mentoring

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.640
has been like extremely smart people and super competent.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.320
So it's not been a problem, but from the people that are starting to contribute,

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.180
for the first time, it's always the first question.

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:17.040
It's like, how do I find issues that I can work on, right?

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.640
Or PRs, which is the most difficult thing to solve because it's not only like, what do you

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.080
like?

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.920
And, you know, what are your skills or interests?

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.920
But, you know, it's also like C-Python is a fairly mature code.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.160
So it's not that easy as like, oh, there is this thing, you know, I pick it up.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.360
But the key here is that a lot of people don't think about the fact that, you know, you don't

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.340
need to think out like, because they think bugs, like what is the bug or what is the feature,

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.460
you know, like that I cannot.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:44.480
A lot of the time what happens is that the easier parts are actually for even for them,

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:44.660
right?

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:48.060
I mean, maybe there is a programmer that really likes coding and, you know, it's very easy

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:48.400
to say.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.700
It's like work on this or do I packaging work on that.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:55.500
But like a lot of people actually, you know, are very passionate precisely about other

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:55.880
things.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.360
They come from a point that core developers don't have, like for instance, documentation.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:04.320
We are quite bad at writing documentation, not because we don't have the skills that we

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:04.460
do.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:07.280
It's because we are already, we are thinking like core developers.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.260
So we are like, okay, yeah, I think I know how, I know the system.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:15.280
So I'm documenting this as I think, you know, and for someone who is new to the system.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:15.720
Yeah.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.300
It's hard to see with new eyes.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:17.560
Yeah.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.000
Yeah.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.640
Or like from the user perspective, like maybe we put a lot

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:25.100
of detail that is not that important and, you know, makes the more difficult, or maybe

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.820
we are missing some things that we think is implementation detail, but there's other is

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:29.020
not.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.820
So, you know, that is quite important.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:35.100
And I mean, happy to see that more and more people are like working on this kind of things

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.140
and those contributions are super important, right?

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.500
Maybe, maybe that's where you can have a huge amount of impact, right?

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.240
Like instead of fixing bugs, I mean, fixing bugs is also important, but I think my first

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.160
PR in the, in CPython was in the documentation.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.240
I'm super proud of it.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.760
Like this actually Marietta was the person who merged it.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.820
Interesting.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:53.360
Yeah.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:53.860
That's fantastic.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.660
I think it's important to mention that.

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:59.960
And, you know, more and more people now are helping with things like CI because like, you

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.160
know, they, they are super knowledgeable about like GitHub actions and they say, oh, actually,

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.480
you know, like this is very inefficient.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.000
Maybe you can do this and blah, blah, blah.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.440
Or like, maybe you do this, you can have in the PRs kind of comments from the compiler

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:12.900
warnings.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.260
That's something that someone could do.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.200
And I mean, that is fantastic.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.320
It's like how many bugs are going to be solved just because, you know, like for us, for even

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.040
for Google as I myself, like helps a lot because we don't need to, when we see the warnings,

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.440
we don't need to fix it ourselves because like, it's there.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:26.680
Right.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.960
So, so those changes are actually more long lasting or even documentation.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:30.760
Like, yeah.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:35.980
And that's the kind of thing that's a little orthogonal to the main CPython code that you

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:39.880
can go and say, I'm going to just try to make the error message more descriptive.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:44.380
And that's less likely to cause some sort of butterfly effect.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.180
Like, well, I changed the speed of the C eval C loop.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.460
And that has all these knock on effects, right?

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.900
Like we put in more details into the string as part of the error.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.220
That's, that's way more doable.

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:55.600
Right.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.540
That kind of stuff as well.

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.820
And I will, and that's the last thing I want to say.

00:46:58.820 --> 00:46:58.860
Yeah.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:04.020
And I would example as well is, you think, oh, is the last, the better errors thing.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.800
I mean, there is a lot of like technical stuff there, but like one thing that happened is

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.720
that now a lot of contributors are actually contributing the errors themselves.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.260
Like not, not, I mean, there's some part of the government would not, but like, it's not

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:20.280
focused on code or like fixing or adding infrastructure is because like, they like, you know, to have

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.680
better errors and they're, they are very passionate about it.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:27.100
And that is fantastic because you know, it's not, it's, it's also a different area when

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.580
it can have a, but you were saying that apparently like people are super happy about that.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.860
And, you know, I've been contributing in very core parts of CPython and I would never have

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:38.480
thought that this was something that is going to be so, so much accepted.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:38.920
Yeah.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:43.920
But if, if you are in the training business, like if you were going and doing an in-person

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.760
event or a workshop and the students are stuck and now they have a message that gives them

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.660
more info that, that helps a lot of things, you know, go more smoothly.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.860
So Brett, I'll, I'll throw this question out to you first here.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:59.440
What are some of the big during the tenure of this group?

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:05.840
So this year, basically, what were some of the big or hard things that you had to decide

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.200
upon?

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.020
Oh, wow.

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:07.520
Right.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.500
Hard things to decide about.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.520
Well, honestly, if we're going to be honest, anything conduct related is always hard.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:20.600
Stuff comes up and as the final deciders, as it were, or the great deciders for the core

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.260
team, sometimes conduct stuff comes up.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.920
Out in the audience, PyLink refers to you all as the dream team.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.200
So.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.380
Thanks for that.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:28.900
But yeah, conduct is always the hardest.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:29.900
We don't like it.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:30.580
No one likes it.

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:31.120
It's tough.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:35.200
We were very lucky that the PSF conduct working group backs us.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.360
I'll disclaimer, I'm on it as well.

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.760
But I also recuse myself whenever Python core stuff comes up.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.140
But it's, we're really going to have them to help us give guidance because that's what

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.980
the kind of work groups there for is actually to provide guidance that actually can't enforce

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:49.340
anything.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.920
But we lean on them to kind of act as independent arbiters of everything.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.020
because for a lot of us, we've been here.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.780
I mean, we've been on this team long enough that we pretty much know everybody.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:48:59.180
Right.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:00.440
And a lot of us are friends.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.960
That's hard to be impartial.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.200
There's a lot of history as well with people.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:09.140
So we lean on the conduct work group to help kind of act as the independent body that doesn't

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.220
have all that baggage as it were with people.

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:15.240
But then it comes back to us and we have to make a final decision of what are we going

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:15.900
to do about this?

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.640
And that's hard every time.

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.640
It's not fun.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.640
It's stressful as heck.

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.260
If it's ever reached that point, it's not great.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:22.500
Yeah.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.700
I would put those in the quadrant of hard and not fun.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:31.360
There are other ones that are in sort of a hard but fun kind of quadrant where, you know,

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:37.420
some of the technical peps and things like that, pattern matching was probably one of the most

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:43.060
recent ones where you really have to think through some difficult technical problems.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:46.440
But that's kind of the fun part of doing this, right?

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:51.060
Like we enjoy that even though it's hard, it's still a fun part of the job.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:57.000
So hopefully there'll be more days and fewer of the fun and not or not fun and hard.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:57.800
Yeah.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.780
Yeah.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:05.740
Probably the closest I can think of off the top of my head was deciding for 310 not to make

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.560
from Dunderfuture import annotations.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:11.580
That was a really tough one because...

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.680
That was a lot of stuff happening in the community.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:17.140
People, certain framework authors are like, you're going to break our framework because

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.820
we depend upon this and whatnot, right?

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.240
Right.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:19.420
Yeah.

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:24.360
I mean, it was one of these things where that PEP was written, accepted, I think, like two

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.320
months after Pydantic was even created.

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.700
It went public or something.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.020
Yeah.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:28.220
Yeah.

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.160
Pydantic and FastAPI were two of the most popular.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:31.960
Exactly.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.800
And stuff has just changed since that PEP got accepted way back when.

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:35.900
I think even that was...

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.520
I don't think that was even steering council decision.

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.600
I think that was a Guido decision.

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.220
No, no, no.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.440
It was a Guido delegated to Ukash decision.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:43.840
Right.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.940
So that was a bit stressful because it all happened right before beta, right?

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:49.680
And it was a lot of...

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.780
It was people reaching out to people.

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:55.380
There was a bit of panic in some corners of the community.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.100
There was...

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:59.800
But we did the best we could to reach out to everyone and say, no, let's have a discussion.

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.500
We can figure this out.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.840
And we just discussed it with everyone involved on both sides of the type...

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.940
All sides of the typing community, both dynamic and static.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.360
And just chatted with people.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.960
I was like, look, we can't rush this.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:13.760
And it's looking like this decision is going to feel rushed based on the feedback we're getting

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.920
very near beta.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.100
So we're just going to rip the code out.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:17.840
Which...

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.860
Thank you, Pablo, for reverting that work.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.080
Because that was a messy back...

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.860
Next time I can dump that on Ukash.

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:25.740
There you go.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.400
Exactly.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:26.740
Yeah.

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:29.040
Because this was pre-Dev in Residence, right?

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:29.380
Yeah.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:29.600
Yeah.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.420
Deal with this.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.700
But it was tough.

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:32.220
It was...

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:36.800
But I think everyone involved was happy with the decision that was made in the end.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:37.780
I have no regrets.

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.480
I don't think anyone else in the Strength Council has regrets.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.840
I think everyone involved feels like it was the right decision not to rush that.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.340
We still have to make a decision, which is tough.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:50.780
We've asked the community to see if anyone wanted to step forward to actually talk with

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:56.280
all areas of the typing world to see like the PEP 649, which Larry Hastings has proposed

00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:02.180
as a solution to the problem of runtime types and binding and all this lot of stuff.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:06.000
We've asked the community, can someone step forward and kind of act as almost a champion

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.820
of a shepherd or an expert to come talk to us to explain like, have we hit all of the

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:16.460
potential issues with the Gender Futures import annotations or PEP 649's proposal or something

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:16.760
else?

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.020
And honestly, no one stepped forward.

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:22.580
So this is actually one of those things where the Strength Council might actually in 2022

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:25.780
have to come forward and we'll have to chat with this ourselves.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:29.180
We'll have to do the legwork and we'll just have to do it and it'll take time.

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.560
But that's what we're here for is if we ask the community to do something and no one

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:36.740
wants to do it, we're the backstop to make sure stuff still happens and works.

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:37.280
Yeah, sure.

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:42.420
Maybe give people who have been tracking that super closely just a quick summary of

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.980
what was that feature and why did it cause a problem?

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:45.360
Yeah.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:50.280
So the from Gender Futures import annotations, what it did was is it made all type annotation

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:56.140
strings, which for performance reasons and forward reference problems is really handy, right?

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:57.600
Like there's no overhead in import.

00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:58.700
Everything is just a string.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:52:59.900
It's in the code object.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:00.880
It's nice and fast.

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.780
And if you need to reference something in the same module before you've actually gotten to

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:05.320
define it, right?

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.040
Like if you have circular references.

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.580
Right.

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:10.000
A class method that returns its own self.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.480
So you would just put that in quotes instead of say it's not me.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:12.780
Yeah.

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:18.600
Or class A has an attribute of class B and class B has got reference A and it takes care of all that.

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.440
Cause it's just strings.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.840
There's, there's nothing to really do there.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.620
And then the type checkers just handle the, like the references.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.420
It's not a problem.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:37.160
The problem is, is projects like Pydantic, which various other projects like Pydantic depend on that messes them up because they need to actually convert those strings back to the original objects that they represent.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:37.480
Right.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.040
Cause they want the rich type information out of that.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:41.180
They need to see the real type.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.080
They want the actual object that that type annotation defines, right?

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:47.580
When you do like list bracket int, right?

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:51.680
They want that actual object that that represents so they can get at that information.

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.400
Oh, okay.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.740
This is type to a list events, not just, oh, it's a string.

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:57.140
I don't know what the heck that is.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:06.880
And there's a function in the standard library that you can call in the inspect and typing module that will, which is now in the inspect module, but a better version of the inspect module that will give you the actual objects.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:12.120
But the problem is, is you still have this reference problem and a couple other things and it's not worked perfectly.

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:22.440
And that's why the dynamic typing side, the live typing side, as it were, the typing community got really worried when they realized this was about to become the permanent thing.

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:34.060
And why we stopped now there is a PEP PEP 649, which tries to use closures instead to kind of capture all the variables and everything, but not execute anything.

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:34.360
Right.

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:41.360
It's very much like a function closure you'd use today, where you had a function and a function, the inner function refers to something in the outer function.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.580
Nothing's actually happened yet, but at least that reference is still there.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.840
So it knows where to look for stuff.

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:52.080
Problem is, is we don't know if 649 fixes enough things for that to be the solution we want to go with.

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:54.760
Because we don't think we're going to get another chance to tweak this, right?

00:54:54.760 --> 00:55:05.200
If we're going to try to come up with a solution that fixes all the problems that from send to future import annotations fixes, we also have to make sure it fixes as many of the other problems that also exist at the same time.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:08.200
So that we only do this once because this is potentially messy.

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:14.020
And it doesn't have to fix everything, but anything that it doesn't fix probably will never get fixed.

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.420
So we have to be prepared to live with that.

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.640
And be very aware of what those non-fixed situations are.

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.440
So everyone knows that's something to be careful.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.820
I think the second aspect is the key.

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:28.640
I think it's probably what is making this so difficult that we already have future input.

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:32.740
And we don't want three of them or a combination of them or whatnot.

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.660
So I think it's important.

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:48.520
And this is the most difficult thing for us because, you know, as a student council, we like reviewing peps is extremely time consuming and whatnot because you need to not only be aware of the change itself, but also like what the documents are written by the authors, right?

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:58.480
And then you need to, I mean, it's not like that is ill intention or anything, but there is a lot of things that maybe are left out or like, so you need to make, make sense of the void that is behind these things.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:58.700
Right.

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:00.800
Or like what is the far reaching effects.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:05.840
And in this case, the problem is that how many other things don't we know that is not going to work?

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:14.420
Because, you know, like now we, like you see, we knew all these use cases days before beta, but like what else about all the people that are not contacting?

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:14.660
Yeah.

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:15.180
Yeah.

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:15.560
Right.

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:18.620
And one thing I want to say as well is because this is important.

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:23.440
Like we, we care about like, you know, the antique and FastAPI, but we care about everything else.

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:23.640
Right.

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:27.720
It's not, you don't need to be the author of a big framework to have the steam council attention.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.640
And that's quite important.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.120
Yeah.

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.680
I think it's important to remind, right.

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:36.160
Because, you know, it's important because there is a lot of people using this use case and therefore, you know, it has more weight.

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.200
That's true.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.380
Just because, you know, if we mess up, it's going to affect more people than some random library.

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:48.720
So the random library is also as important as long as it's using, you know, the interfaces that we provide in its own right.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.000
Right.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:56.300
And this is important to know because like maybe there is a community of people that use type annotations for, I don't know, database tables or who knows.

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:56.560
Yeah.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.640
And then they didn't follow out contacting the steam council or the Python dev or whatever.

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:10.560
So, you know, it's important if you're listening to this and then you're an author of libraries that use type annotations or even a user that uses type annotations in non-standard ways.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:19.960
It's very important to reach to us and maybe in the future to this person, we're going to lead this effort because we absolutely need to know what these peps are not going to fix.

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:23.960
So we say as a steam council, okay, we take the, or the next steam council, right.

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:31.020
We take the informed decision to accept this pep, even if these use cases are going to be sacrificed because as Thomas says, we cannot fix everything.

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:31.220
Right.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:38.820
But we must know where we're lifting it out because what we cannot have is now, you know, this situation again, because just we miss.

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.940
You only get so many readers.

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:41.300
Carol?

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:41.680
Right.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.040
Yeah.

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:48.860
I mean, there's so many different communication levels on this whole thing.

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:57.420
I mean, as you know, Michael, from doing all your courses, a 30 year old language that has many different use cases.

00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.020
It's hard to sort of one size fits all.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:01.620
Oh, yeah.

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:01.720
Yeah.

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:12.840
And I think, you know, I reached out to Sebastian and Samuel because we had been using FastAPI with great success and our engineers really loved it.

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:20.960
And I think it is something that, you know, is re-energizing the whole web-based side of Python.

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:25.600
So you don't want to sort of cut that off at its knees.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.220
Exactly.

00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:33.000
It's one of the things, taking advantage of so many of the cool new features, the typing, the async and all those things and whatnot.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:43.060
Right. But by the same token, you know, it also, as a library writer, you know, with JupyterHub and Binder, it's really hard to keep up with everything.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:50.140
And we tried to always test ahead, but not everybody will and can do that.

00:58:50.140 --> 00:59:00.640
And then also what you do is you understand your library well, but you don't necessarily understand the Python internals at the same level or the same depth.

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:13.740
And so I think Lukash's proactive, you know, reports out as well as Pablo's amazing release notes in the last couple of years helps to communicate out what's going on.

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:18.160
And this was an unfortunate, you know, last minute revert.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:24.280
And the whole community working together is really what's needed to be successful over time.

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:34.140
And I'm glad we, although it was tough in the moment, I'm glad we sort of weathered through that because we've seen growth all around as a result of it.

00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:34.980
Yeah, absolutely.

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:37.660
Really quickly, because we're getting short on time.

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:44.240
Alvaro out in the audience asked, was enum.stir enum delay related to breaking Pydantic?

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.960
We can give a really, really quick answer.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.260
No, had nothing to do whatsoever with Pydantic.

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:48.940
All right, cool.

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:57.240
Ethan's been working on a bunch of changes to the enum module and making the repper and stir of enums make more sense.

00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:57.920
Oh, that's great.

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:03.660
And there were some changes that we weren't sure if they were going to impact users in a negative way.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:07.980
But we just wanted to make sure that we understood the decision and why it was made.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:16.980
So we asked him to revert it for 310 and then write a PEP to propose the changes just because of the scale and the impact of the changes.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.020
Propose a PEP for 311.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:21.100
And we ended up rejecting that PEP.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:26.840
So that was just purely based on the change that was made and the rationale for the change.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:33.200
And we don't know of any actual breakage that would have happened, but it's just not something that we were.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.200
Someone's trying to parse the repper and it doesn't work anymore or something.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.100
Well, logging it and that kind of thing.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.980
You never know where those things end up.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:42.420
Yeah.

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.540
Brett, it looks like you were going to add one more thing.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.580
And then I think we're getting short on time.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.120
Maybe I'll ask you one more question then.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.080
It was just an aside, but just to share how much of a fan I am.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:57.160
Last week on Python Bytes, you and Brian were asking whether 3.10.1 was a security concern or not.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.580
And I was just going to say, call out Pablo's great release notes.

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.400
If they don't screen security, it's not a security problem.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.060
All right, super.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:11.660
Because if I go and check the Apple release notes for some OS updates, it's like, oh, it contains this little thing and other possible security.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.020
You never, sometimes you don't know, right?

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:14.680
If it's just...

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.260
No, we are very thorough with those notes.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:24.340
And when we release, actually, it's possible that we release extra versions when there is something very important.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.420
I think I have actually a bunch of those.

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:33.080
For that, I mean, I have not been forced to do any of this, but sometimes, you know, there is CVs and whatnot.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.500
We are very into that.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.300
So, yeah.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.340
Unless we say it, it's kind of okay.

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:46.600
Well, I just want to thank everyone in the entire Python community for not writing a sub language inside of logging for Python.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:54.400
It's funny because the logging module was definitely inspired by the Java logging module, but...

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.700
Yeah, you can tell why the names.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:01.960
You know, I didn't decide to include, you know, that particular load of class path thing.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.400
Remote pickles or whatever the equivalent would be.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.140
Right, right.

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.380
Fantastic.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:20.120
All right, let's close out our conversation here, which has been great, with maybe the challenges or the opportunities, whichever side of the glass fullness you want to take for the Python community that you all see.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:26.440
Like, what do you see as like a big opportunity or maybe as a big thing we need to be aware of and try to work to avoid?

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.740
Barry, go with you first, I guess, since you're top of the video.

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.460
Oh, I'm going to steal probably the thunder, I guess.

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:43.100
I think the two really interesting things that are happening in Python land these days are the faster CPython work that Guido and his team is working on over at Microsoft.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:48.580
And I think the other really interesting thing is Sam Grace's no-kill work.

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:53.200
From a technical standpoint, I think, you know, we have a lot of smart people in the community.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.880
We can work through the technical parts of it.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:02.300
I think the really interesting thing will be the sort of the social aspects and how we make all that work and get people comfortable with those changes.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.700
It's easy to make everything faster, better, stronger.

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:08.040
But if there's compromises, all of a sudden it becomes a challenge.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:08.220
Yeah.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.540
Thomas, you want to go next?

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:15.680
Well, I'm just going to say finding a new executive director for the Python Self-Ware Foundation is right up there for me.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:15.940
Yeah.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:23.880
Because that may have significant impact on the long-term goals of the PSF and the direction of the community and all that.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:29.340
And even though the PSF is very much driven by the community, it's still, you know, it's still a big deal.

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:34.420
However, I do realize most of the community probably doesn't care and it's all happening behind the scenes.

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:39.000
So I'm just going to say the Sam Gross thing is the thing that I think is the great opportunity.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.180
It's going to take years to land an interpreter that doesn't have a GIL and it's going to break a bunch of things.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:55.860
And we just need to be very deliberate and shiver that correctly and make sure that there's a migration path for users and as little impact as we can manage.

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:56.720
Yeah, absolutely.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.520
That's a good one.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.120
Carol?

01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:58.660
Yeah.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:04.280
I mean, I see a really, really bright future for Python for a couple of reasons.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:09.580
One, our community has always embraced education and continual learning.

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:14.880
And I think that is part of having a vibrant language after 30 years.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:18.060
The kids coming out of school are excited they still get to use this.

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:20.880
Not, oh no, do I have to learn this now, right?

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.700
Exactly.

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:26.480
And then from a standpoint of being a truly global language,

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:34.580
where you're seeing innovation in Africa, Asia, South America, you know, all over the world.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.340
And I think that's exciting.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:39.080
You know, I'm excited to see what comes next.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:44.620
And I have full confidence the next steering council will help guide us in the right direction.

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:45.460
Yeah, fantastic.

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:45.820
Brett?

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:46.980
Yeah, this is a tough one.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.260
I feel like I've been around too long.

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:57.960
I'm just curious to see how the community continues to be the community that it is in the face of whatever this pandemic throws at us in 2022, which is hopefully nothing.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.180
But we all know that that may not be.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.940
We've gone a while, PyCon less.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:06.320
Yeah, well, and even if this year is a little tricky for like someone from Canada, right?

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.420
Like traveling down to the States is not quite as simple.

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:18.440
So even if PyCon US is more US folk because it's easier for them to travel and some of us international folk can't make it this year, it's at least good that we're at least seemingly going that direction.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:25.680
But I mean, kudos to the community for keeping things going and continuing to make this community feel welcoming and open, even if it's been fully virtual for everything.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:26.680
So yeah, absolutely.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:35.040
My hope is we'll just be able to continue to find ways for the community to do that for itself and continue to feel welcoming and open and inviting regardless of the situation.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.260
And yeah, whatever that brings.

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:37.560
Yeah.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.580
We'll pull through it.

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:39.140
We will.

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:39.460
Pablo?

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:55.080
I think, I mean, I share a lot of the things that have been said, but I think my, I think with the biggest challenges that we are going to face as a community, as a language is that we are like, we have so many big groups of users that are using the language that have, you know, are very passionate.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:59.920
I have different priorities that now it was not true before, but now it's especially not true.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:04.800
It's not possible to make everyone happy and decisions that make some people happy are directly hurting others.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.480
And we have seen this express a lot, right?

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:12.840
You know, educators don't like big new things because, you know, it makes more difficult and language is bigger and whatnot.

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.320
Well, you know, enterprise Python, let's call that a lot.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:21.260
But like, you know, they are pushing for features that make more sense in that scale or not exclusive.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:32.180
So I think it's quite hard because now it's not a matter anymore of like deciding where the actual good decision is and like, you know, digging for it and picking it and, you know, this was a good decision.

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:32.680
Not anymore.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:32.960
Right.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.620
But now you need to take decisions that are going to affect a group positively and another group negatively.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:42.120
And that is a quite important position to be into.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:48.740
It's hard to know because the community is so diverse in terms of technical and application of the code and stuff.

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:48.900
Exactly.

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.960
And in action is some possibility in some cases.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.680
And maybe we need to be more, you know, more conservative.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.980
But in some others, it's impossible because, you know, the language needs to evolve.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:05.100
Like the GIL work that was mentioned, we cannot say, I mean, we could say, yeah, we are not going to do it because, you know, it's going to break a lot.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:08.120
And, you know, everyone is going to be doing part of the C extensions or whatever.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.800
I mean, the language needs to evolve, right?

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:14.680
Like even grammar and, you know, implementations and, you know, community-wise.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.500
And, you know, it's very hard.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.160
It's very hard and it's impossible to make everyone happy.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.400
Like, it's not difficult.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:21.900
It's impossible.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.160
And I think that's the biggest.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.240
As a community, I will hope that, you know, more than we make everyone happy,

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:34.280
we understand each other and, you know, we come to a place when there is some good vibes about these problems.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.560
I think that's going to be the biggest challenge, given how big our use base is.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.960
Yeah, that is important.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.580
All right, everyone, we are definitely out of time.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.460
Thank you for taking all this really quickly.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.440
Finish it up with just one of the final questions.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.720
And we'll just super quick.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.240
What editor used, Barry?

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.620
Emacs, still.

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:51.620
Thomas?

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:54.280
Joe, which no one will have heard of.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.020
I have not heard of.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:57.140
My brother's name is Joe, but I'm sure he doesn't help you.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:57.820
I know Joe.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:01.960
Joe is Joe's own editor and it's from like the 80s.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:06.860
And it has WordStar key bindings, if you know what WordStar is, which is why I use it.

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:07.320
Right on.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.440
Carol?

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.140
I have to say, truthfully, Vim, VS Code, PyCharm.

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:12.480
Right.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:13.520
The gamut.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.480
Brett, I could predict yours, but go ahead and let us know.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.680
Visual Studio.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.260
Right on.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:18.820
Pablo?

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:19.380
Vim.

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:19.860
Vim.

01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:20.180
Okay.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:24.900
Well, I will join Pylang in saying thank you for all the work.

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:29.140

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:29.720

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:30.320

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:33.600

Thanks to you.

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:34.840
