WEBVTT

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.620
Geography of the Study of Places and Relationships Between People and Their Environments.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.440
Often we think of maps, but maps are static.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.740
GIS gets interesting when you realize that we're studying and visualizing data

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.780
flowing through these locations and communities.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.980
In this episode, you'll meet Silas Toms.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.480
He's an author of several Python GIS books and the co-host of the Mapist Hour podcast.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.640
Are you ready to dive into GIS with Python?

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.360
This is Talk Python To Me, episode 295, recorded October 27th, 2020.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:46.920
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.320
ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.120
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.280

Please check out the offers during their segments.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.600
It really helps support the show.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.100
At Talk Python, we run a bunch of web apps and web APIs.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.500
These power the training courses as well as the mobile apps on iOS and Android.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.520
If I had to build these from scratch again today, there's no doubt which framework I would

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.780
use.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.900
It's FastAPI.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.760
To me, FastAPI is the embodiment of modern Python and modern APIs.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.240
You have beautiful usage of type annotations.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.900
You have model binding and validation with Pydantic.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.760
And you have first-class async and await support.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.020
If you're building or rebuilding a web app, you owe it to yourself to check out our newest

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.860
course, Modern APIs with FastAPI over at Talk Python Training.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.400
This is the first course in a series we're building on FastAPI.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.180
And for just $39, it'll take you from interested to production with FastAPI.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.780
Silas, welcome to Talk Python and me.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.680
Oh, thank you so much for having me, Michael.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.980
Yeah, it's great to have you.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.960
Since this is a GIS episode, where are you calling in from?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.660
Where are you located?

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.740
I'm in San Francisco, where I've lived for the last 13 years now, since I moved down for

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.280
grad school.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.140
Oh, right on.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.960
I grew up in Northern California, kind of in the middle of nowhere, but I always really

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.440
enjoyed this city and I've come to really love it.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.000
Yeah, it's a neat place.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.600
If you were to jump on I-5, the north-south major highway for people who don't know, and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.240
go north for a very long time until the next big city you hit, you'd get to Portland,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.240
where I am, so right on.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.560
You know, I think Ashland's a big city.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.340
You know, Ashland is nice to visit.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.760
Yeah.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.460
But if you could throw a rock across it, it's not a big city.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.540
Yeah, there you go.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.920
Yeah.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.640
You can only have so much Shakespeare in your life.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.120
Yeah.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.240
That's right.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.380
We're going to talk about GIS and Python and all those sorts of things, but a bunch of

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.940
cool job experiences that you've had, as well as some of the libraries and applications and

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.180
whatnot.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.940
Well, let's start with the beginning.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.600
How'd you get into programming in Python?

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.760
It was kind of a circuitous route.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.380
I mean, my parents, of all things, were organic farmers up in the middle of nowhere when I was

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.900
born in Northern Humboldt County.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.720
And my dad had always kind of had an interest in technology.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.240
He wasn't averse or anything.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.480
So when I was about eight, he got a little computer that was programmable that had a

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.920
basic program on it.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.420
And so he used that to keep track of sales at our fruit stand.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.100
Oh, right on.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.940
And he taught me how to...

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.360
Yeah, it was cute.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.760
And probably 800 lines or something, which seemed amazing to me.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.600
Because he taught me how to do a little bit and I would do little silly things when I was

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.580
seven years old or whatever.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.240
You know what's interesting about code is it's not always about how big or how complex it is.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.800
Sometimes it's about what it empowers or the problem that it solves.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.700
Like I can think of a couple of libraries and it's like, gosh, this is so nice this exists.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.260
And it's like a hundred lines of code.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.700
Yeah.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.560
But I just love that it exists, you know?

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.160
Completely.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.160
Like we'll get into it.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.080
But like PyShape, it's an implementation reading shapefiles for geospatial data to format.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.540
And it's relatively simple, compact, and it's beautiful.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.120
I love it.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.920
Yeah, for sure.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.180
Okay.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.780
So you had this experience with this basic app that was running the family business?

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.140
Yeah.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.980
Well, there was that.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.660
And then in high school, around 97, I took an elective in computer programming, also basic,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.440
which I didn't like love the other crowd in the room, really.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.320
I was always thinking of myself as a little more active.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.640
I played sports, but I did like it.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.940
I just, I couldn't fully identify with it.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.540
And being from like a rural kind of macho county, like it just didn't occur to me that

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.780
that was something I could do.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.440
And if you could see the future, like...

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.120
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.200
Now all the cool stuff you can build and like how sort of tech has changed in perception,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.500
right?

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.960
Who knows?

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.600
Maybe it would have...

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.960
Well, maybe if I could just read the newspaper, because at that time, it was like the first dot-com

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.280
wave.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.020
And I just wasn't really in the mindset that that was something I would do with my career.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.960
But I went to college.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.440
I went to Santa Cruz, and then I was kind of homesick.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.740
I finished up back at Humboldt State University and got really into geography, which is a really

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.260
interesting quasi-science, I guess you'd say, that has a lot of really interesting theories

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.880
about why the world is, how it's divided up and why it's divided up the way it is.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.840
How people sort of present themselves across space, how cultures interact with the physical

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.420
sciences.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.780
And somebody who like spent my whole childhood like reading through encyclopedias, it was just

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.580
the best combination of learning and interests that I could ever find.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.360
So without even realizing it, I had never heard of geography before I really got into college.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.300
It was amazing.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.320
It was perfect for me.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.760
And it had this component that was, I think, a bit too lightly touched on called GIS, geospatial

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.180
information systems that I got exposed to.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.600
And I thought it was kind of cool, but I wasn't, again, expecting to make computers a part of my

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.160
professional career at that time.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.400
I was really focusing on environmental policy and water policy, especially.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.500
Humboldt County has a lot more rain than the rest of California, and they've built these

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.760
giant dam systems to bring it down to the Central Valley.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.640
And it seemed like there was a huge fish die-offs in 2001, 2002 that were directly attributed

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.760
to the lack of water.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.420
And so I got kind of interested in like, how did they make these decisions to build these

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.860
dams?

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.380
Why does this water policy exist?

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.760
How did they benefit and value agriculture, like sort of profit or cotton that wasn't really

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.520
making a profit in the Central Valley versus salmon, which could be very valuable where I

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.800
was from.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.500
So I got really deep into those weeds and ended up going into grad school in San Francisco

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.100
State for geography with a focus on resource management.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.500
And that was 2007.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.080
Nice.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.080
And did you end up with like a lot of data?

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.160
Do you need a process?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.300
You're like, all right, I guess I'm going to have to take out these computers again.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.260
I just remember like late nights trying to figure out, like just really struggling with

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.700
the software and doing some interesting.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.800
Also, another interest of mine was wine.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.540
And I remember trying to do like a temperature map of Humboldt County because a lot of the

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.960
organic farming families that I'd grown up with had started growing wine at the time.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.920
And I wanted to see like, how does it compare temperature-wise to Napa Valley or to other well-known

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.380
places?

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.380
And I just hated the manual data entry that I was doing.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.980
And I thought, there's got to be a better way.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.860
So those feelings and a couple internships that I got when I got to grad school really

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.740
led me to value programming.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.560
And I felt so stupid with it at first because even though I'd had that experience as a child,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.980
it had been a decade since I'd really touched a keyboard that way.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.380
And I felt like there's got to be something to this.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.240
So I'll just keep hitting my head against the wall.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.660
And even though I feel kind of dumb, I know that I can use this.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.980
And it really worked out.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.220
Yeah, that's super cool.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.160
I think it's really interesting in your story about how you kind of like slowly just dragged

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.540
you in.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.500
And then you're like, fine, fine, you've got me.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.700
I kind of went down the same path as you in some regards in that I didn't really see myself

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.460
as a developer.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.060
I kept looking to do other things, chemistry and math and so on.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.920
And eventually I just like, you know what?

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.660
Actually, I do like this better, but it's easy to forget those early days of like fighting

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.980
with the syntax.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:17.140
Just, yeah, I remember being so excited about getting a C++ program to compile a little bit

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:17.520
right now.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.100
It's going to have to run and work correctly.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.880
That's the hard part.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.520
Not the compiling, but these early days.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.160
Yeah.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.100
You step over these challenges and then they're kind of in the past.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.620
But yeah, everyone goes through them.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.260
Well, I remember when I was really trying to learn in 2008, I took a class that was sort of

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.780
an elective offered through the computer science department.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.380
And I got to be really good friends with the guy who was just a master's in engineering student

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:39.820
himself.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.840
And he really saw that I cared, even though I didn't know anything, basically.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.220
And so he spent some time and taught me a bit of Django at that time, which was just coming

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:48.480
out.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:55.580
And I remember getting so excited when I was able to have Django use ArcPy, talk to a shapefile,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.060
get a location out and put it on a browser.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.740
Just like a little tiny thing.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.020
Yeah.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.920
I showed my grandmother.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.540
I'm like, grandma, I did it.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.220
She had no idea what I was talking about.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.040
I bet she was really happy to see it though.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.220
She must've been psyched.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.880
She didn't discourage me.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.540
She was so excited.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.540
But I just remember that moment of just like, I did it.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.240
And the wizardry of that.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.720
I still don't think I'm over that, really.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.180
Yeah.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.180
No, I haven't gotten over it either.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.720
It's amazing.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.900
And just that feeling of I built something that could be useful to people and it's out there

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.040
and they can play with it and then to see them come and use it is just amazing.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:35.140
I started just that same process of like, whatever I could do at work.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.100
Because at this point I had gotten a job as a GIS technician.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.760
I was making maps of a park district lands that they were considering adding.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.540
And I found it great to be paid, especially during the recession there.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.720
But I was not like loving the work itself.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:59.320
So I found all kinds of ways to use Python to automate, to figure out how to make like a database of all the other maps we had made to just anything that I could think of that was interesting to me.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.540
I'm never going to enter a map a second time.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.960
Yeah, exactly.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.460
Stupid map.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.540
So and then somewhere in there, I got a call from a recruiter.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:17.020
I had some friends of friends who were in the program who knew that I did some Python and they recommended me for a job at an environmental consulting firm called ICF.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.780
And the recruiter, I remember him saying like, do you really want to work for the government?

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.760
You know, you're like 27, right?

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.800
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.940
I was so happy to just have a steady job at that point that I wasn't actively looking, but there was some pull to just something different and exciting.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:43.900
And I really benefited because it brought me into the opportunity to work on big environmental projects like the high-speed rail project and figure out how to use Python to automate those.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:55.820
Because we were getting engineering outlines in AutoCAD and we had to convert that into GIS formats and then run that against all of the data we had on species range.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:01.380
Or any kind of protected resource, even like farmland or wetlands or anything like that.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.580
And we had to do it week after week after week.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:09.680
And I was kind of, I just remember that first call when I first got hired where I was like, I think I can automate this.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.700
Yeah.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.120
With that upward tilt in my voice, but I could.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.000
And I did.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.140
That's awesome.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.580
I kind of became a team.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.780
And they probably saw you, like you said, as a wizard.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.900
They're like, Silas can make it do it automatically.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.080
Do you understand what that means?

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.340
On its own, right?

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.400
Like not other people.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:26.880
Yeah.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.960
And some of the libraries we're going to talk about in GIS are like, hey, I've got this lake and I've got this other thing.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.900
Do they intersect?

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.220
Or does this line pass through this area?

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.220
And really interesting stuff that builds on common libraries that people will know like SQL.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.220
Well, exactly.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:54.240
You know, the one big one that really got me at that time, because I was running into like licensing issues with the Esri ArcGIS software that we were running, couldn't really do some of the higher level analyses I needed to do.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.740
So I heard about this thing called PostGIS, which was built on top of what is it?

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:11.100
PostgreSQL and then a library called PsychoPG2 that allowed me to write spatial SQL and directly talk to a database and do those analyses in code like I had never been able to do before.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.640
And it kind of blew my mind.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.880
This is around 2010, 11 or something.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:28.160
That's when I realized like beyond the world of the software that they had given me, this Esri software, there was this incredible open source software community that was providing tools that exactly the ones I needed.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.980
And I can tweak them and do so much more and so much faster.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:32.480
Yeah.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.140
So interesting.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.900
And you don't have to ask for licensing or worry about that or whatever.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.820

All right.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.700
Before we get off this sort of intro topic, though, really quick,

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.000
what are you up to these days?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.680
You've got a pretty interesting job working with an intersection of a lot of these concepts.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.480
Well, yeah.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.800
So, you know, that sort of like do-gooder mentality has never really gone away.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.920
And I've worked on some big enterprise systems for a whole city, let's say,

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:08.000
which included creating a GIS for the Super Bowl for Levi's Stadium when it was here.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.420
I got to go to the Super Bowl.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.920
We did every concert and event for two years before that.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:18.040
So, I saw Beyonce, you know, I saw Taylor Swift or all these people, right?

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:25.260
Just because I built a mapping system that used Python to talk to a 911 database to locate calls that were coming from the stadium.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.700
And also, we figured out how to put an iPhone app in the pocket of the police so that we could see where they were.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.320
And we could keep 70,000 drunk people from beating themselves up, you know?

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.160
And so, there was that.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:44.320
But then, like, after that, I felt like I really wanted to just kind of go even more into front-end development and learn more JavaScript.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:56.900
So, I ended up joining a team at NIO, which is, they've, like, shut down their U.S. operations, but it's a Chinese electric car company that's working on automatic cars and self-driving cars.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.680
And that sparked a lot.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.520
And that team that I worked with, I did leave and go to Zillow, which I'll get to in a bit.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.420
But that team that I worked with, I loved.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:14.520
And that team, one of the main guys, Josh Butler, founded this company, Kinetic Eye, which is, I think, the biggest realization from NIO, from all the work we did, all these smart people we worked with, is that,

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.180
self-driving cars is so hard.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:30.820
And so, using computer vision, using machine learning, without, like, a really directed mission is going to be an incredibly hard thing to master for the next decade or so, even if you spend $10 billion on it.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.200
I honestly can't believe we have self-driving cars.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:42.140
It's, I always thought of the AI realm being like, oh, yeah, we're going to do this Turing test, and you're going to have the app chat with somebody over text.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.920
And then, if it seemed real enough, your AI is, like, real.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.700
And somehow, that always felt so shallow and fake.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.720
And then, it was somehow kind of stagnated there.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:58.180
And then, all of a sudden, cars are driving themselves around at a level of complexity so far beyond that they don't even compare, right?

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.780
And somehow, we couldn't quite get one, and we got this other.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.680
I mean, yeah.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.660
Tesla just rolled out their beta, right, last week or something.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.380
Yeah, exactly.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.620
It's advancing all the time.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:15.240
I still felt like it was a huge problem, and level four, level five self-driving cars, which we were working towards, was going to be a decade off.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:23.620
So, this team that split off, we're focused on computer vision in small spaces, in warehouses, to see, like, how safe are people being?

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.080
How much risk are people causing with their driving habits or with their work habits?

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:35.540
And how can we give business owners the ability to understand how safe the practices are at their work?

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.460
How much potential risk they have for, like, a worker's comp or an injury?

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:44.640
And the do-gooder in me loves it because, like, injuries just ripple out throughout a community.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.700
If somebody is hurt, then they're out of work for a while.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.780
Then their family is hurting.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.940
Then their community is hurting.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:59.040
And we really want to, like, have this use of computer vision that identifies intelligently risk and safety.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.700
And so, it's a cool mission and also great technology.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.100
Yeah.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:07.240
So, if I had a factory and maybe after lunch, people would come back and they weren't putting on their hard hats.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:07.580
Yeah.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.500
Or something like that.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.840
You would say, like, ah, we're missing some hard hats?

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.460
Something like that?

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:11.780
Yeah.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:11.860
Yeah.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:12.180
Yeah.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.140
Hard hats, vests, masks.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.820
Social distancing was one we built right away, obviously, when COVID hit.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.340
Oh, yeah.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.180
Of course, yeah.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:26.880
And then forklift speeding, forklift near misses is really cool because we're able to plot it on a map, you know, like, brings it back to the map.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:34.240
So, all those insane, like, YouTube videos of, like, people crashing, doing stupid stuff on, like, you know, work just after hours.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.740
Like, you would know about that kind of stuff?

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.140
Yes, exactly.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.260
You know, we're working towards, like, a real-time notification.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.900
I think that that's in our future.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:47.220
But more than anything, it's the all-the-time risk environment that we want to let people know about.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.600
Like, how well are you doing and how safe are your people?

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.060
Sure.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.480
Yeah, that sounds like a great mission.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.280
Let's talk broadly about GIS for the moment.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.820
Just some of the areas which have been used.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.880
I mean, we talked a little bit about this with some of the environmental things you talked about.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:08.220
I mean, I guess one of the things that most starkly stands out for me, maybe two, is one, is directions.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.540
Like, another thing that I'm just blown away by.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.020
Yeah.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.820
And also, probably, like, a little bit weakened by, just as a human, is GPS.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.700
The ability to ask Google Maps or something else how to get me there.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:26.560
And just, I'm thinking of the feeling I have when I, for some reason, forgot my phone or the battery dies.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.120
I'm just like, oh, I'm done.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:28.600
Yeah.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.740
What's going to happen now?

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.180
I have no GPS.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.160
Right?

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.440
Whereas, like, I grew up without even a cell phone.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.340
So, it's just such a weird thing.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.980
But absolutely GPS, right?

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.640
Well, 20 years later, it's just become part of our lives.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:52.680
Like, I remember in, like, 2001, let's say, trying to drive through San Francisco and being so freaked out, driving probably the longest way I could because it was the only route I knew to get safely from one side to the other.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.320
And just couldn't imagine, you know, how easy it is today.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.720
I went and visited my uncle who had gone to the Naval Academy.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.220
And he was living in Annapolis in, like, 2005.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.920
And I had some friends in D.C.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.720
And I said, I'd like to go visit them.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.400
How do I get down there?

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.300
And he's like, oh, well, there's GPS in my car.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.340
So, you can just take my car.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.840
And it will just tell you how to get there.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.940
And I couldn't believe it.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:17.160
It was just the easiest trip I'd ever had, door-to-door, in an area I had never visited in my life.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:17.920
It blew my mind.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.200
Yeah.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:18.880
It's so amazing.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.600
I remember doing some work in Shanghai.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.640
And I had one of the early iPhones.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.380
And I was using Google Maps.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.640
I had gotten into the habit of, I'd sort of pick a random orientation.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.540
I'm going to go that way for about an hour, walking and exploring.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.660
And when I get tired, I'm going to just hit, take me back to my hotel.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.000
And I had gotten really far one day.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.560
And the phone was down to, like, 10%.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.740
And I'm like, oh, my God.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.520
I forgot the name of my hotel.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.080
And I can't speak Chinese.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:43.880
I can't speak Mandarin.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.300
I'm going to be in really big trouble.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.580
So, I had to just turn it off.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.560
I'm like, please turn back on and get me close.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.860
You know, like, that was the most extreme concern of lacking GPS.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.980
But, yeah, certainly those things are amazing.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.040
Another area that I think is really probably interesting,

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.420
and maybe actually has a little more personal touch for you is agriculture, right?

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.640
Like, understanding your crops and growing things.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.980
And just, you know, you think of sort of the idyllic farmer with just basic tools, right?

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.860
But there's a lot of IoT and a lot of smarts you can apply to those things now.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:22.200
The marriage of GPS and GIS and farm tech is just all over, especially, let's say, the Midwest,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.300
where they have, you know, one of the first self-driving applications was tractors, right?

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.240
Because it's so boring to just be in a tractor for a straight line for a long, long, long time and then turn around, right?

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.100
So, they figured out how to make the thing turn around using a satellite.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.900
And it's pretty impressive.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.880
I've always thought, too, that even, like, down to the small organic farms that I grew up with, you know,

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:47.400
where you're incredibly resource-specific, you need to know exactly what went where and keep track of it, you know, for regulations.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.300
But also just to know what to grow next and to keep track of your nutrient levels in your soil,

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.060
that GIS and mapping would be a really great use.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:01.560
I'm not sure how far it's gotten into there because a lot of them are kind of old-school hippies who don't, you know,

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.340
they still use pen and paper as much as possible.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.220
But it's...

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.320
Maybe if you tell them it's open source and it's not corporate, they might accept it a little more.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.980
They might love that, yeah.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.500
So, yeah, it's become incredibly important.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:17.200
And, you know, like just monitoring water levels, for instance, like, what do they call it?

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.740
NDVI, which is like how you can see how well your crops are watered or thriving

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.860
based on, like, the infrared that you can't see from the satellite imagery we can get now.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.660
It's just incredible revelation, you know, and seeing that.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.200
Yeah, I can imagine.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:31.760
Yeah.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.360
But then, you know, I kind of pulled away from that when I came down to the city

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.200
and got more into, like, environmental services, environmental industry.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.980
And the two biggest projects I worked on was the high-speed rail, as I mentioned.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.240
And then also the PG&E has power lines everywhere.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.480
That's caused some issues because there's branches that have rubbed up on it and fires have started.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:56.100
They have programs that monitor how much trimming they do around all of their lines throughout

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.540
all of Northern California, and they keep track of it.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.900
And then they also have to kind of estimate within all that work how many, you know, endangered

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.320
species they stepped on accidentally, that kind of thing.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.320
And because it's something that is expected work, they have to mitigate.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.460
So, we would use GIS to calculate basically how much PG&E needed to pay.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:14.880
The impact.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.840
Yeah, the impact.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.040
That was really cool.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.380
The species animal equivalent of a carbon tax or carbon offset or something like that, right?

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.060
Yeah, pretty much.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:24.360
Yeah.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.940
It's just kind of how it goes.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:32.260
The thing is, if they don't trim those lines, I mean, those fires are horrible this year.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.640
And, you know, it's not like you could say, well, you just shouldn't trim them, right?

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.800
It's going to be worse, right?

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.420
It's like a necessary evil, basically.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.640
Yeah, you have to do it.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.140
I don't want to say I got disillusioned, but I realized in some ways that the industry

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.160
is, it's sort of just like insurance.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:50.180
It's something, an expected business payment that you have to do to cover the effects of

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:55.840
your business, especially for those giant utilities or other large construction projects, which

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.280
is fine.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.520
It maybe dampened my enthusiasm a bit.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.280
But really, at that point, I was really getting excited by the technology.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.680
It turns out I really like programming.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:12.060
And I decided to move on to a company that was focused on city, like city GIS, like enterprise

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:16.400
GIS, being able to integrate, you know, the police with the sewers, with everything.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.240
Because when we got there to that city, which is Santa Clara.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.780
Basically building the smart city.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.480
Smart city.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:21.820
Yeah.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.640
You know, they had like 11 different address databases that they were using.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.880
Each department had their own and they were all different.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.400
So like, imagine the police not knowing when you're at where your address is.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.300
Well, it's more common than you would think, unfortunately.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:34.900
Right.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.200
And smart cities really appealed to me.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.220
So I spent a couple of years doing that.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.540
And that was amazing work.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.700
But I just, again, really liked the programming so much.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:50.400
I started moving away probably from pure GIS into a lot of like front end stuff.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:55.300
But that kind of gave me an opportunity to get to know web mapping and JavaScript and all

00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:00.260
the amazing JavaScript tools that have come out over the last 10 years to enable mapping

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:00.980
on the web.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.340
Yeah.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.120
So you worked at Zillow, for example, which is pretty awesome.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:04.440
Yeah.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.920
Zillow is definitely one of those cutting edge companies.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.600
I remember being blown away when Zillow, when I first experienced Zillow, I'm like, I could

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.640
see what my neighbors paid for their house.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.200
Yeah.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.780
And the value, predicted value of it now.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.380
And just like all that sort of neighborhood-y stuff.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.360
Really interesting.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:21.940
Yeah.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:28.940
Well, when Zillow came out in like 2005, let's say, Esri really dominated the GIS space.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:33.700
But you started to see these little cracks appear where like mashups, as they called them in the

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.540
late aughts.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.060
That's right.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.380
That was the web 2.0.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:36.880
Yeah.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.460
Mashups.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:37.920
Mashups.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.600
That was all the hype.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:43.080
And in reality, you know, Zillow is just still a mashup.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:50.140
It's a map with a data overlay of parcel information and some machine learning predictive algorithms,

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.400
I'm assuming, that go into the values, the Zestimates that you see.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.520
Yeah, those estimates.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.000
That's right.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.960
So, it was really cool.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.980
And what we were focusing on, or at least what I was brought in to focus on as the geospatial

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:07.540
lead there, was mapping every single neighborhood in America and Canada to understand like how

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.900
people defined the space around them.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.720
Because again, for me, in some ways, the geography was more important than the code itself, per se.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.240
It was.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:15.760
Yeah.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:15.860
Yeah.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:21.800
And it got really cool, but that project was canceled to focus on other big projects.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:29.060
So, I got into data pipelines and I did actually a lot of Spark work, some PySpark, but also

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.140
using Scala.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.560
I did a little bit more Scala.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.860
So, I cheated on Python there.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.020
That's for a different podcast.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:38.220
But yeah, like it was amazing work.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.720
And it is still though, in some ways, like web 2.0.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.140
And I kind of wanted to really be a part of the future.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.960
I really be a part of whatever this wave is.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.340
Is this 2.3.0, 4.0, 10.0?

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.780
I don't know anymore.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:51.860
More.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.280
4.0.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.000
But I think that that's having worked at NEO right before that and seeing what was going

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.360
on there with the self-driving and the computer vision, which is fascinating stuff.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.340
And just my experience with computer vision actually comes from GIS because classification

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.700
of data, of satellite data is a big part of GIS.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:14.760
There's this division between like vector and raster data and the raster data coming out of

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.100
satellites.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.160
You got to look at the pictures out of the satellites and make some sense of it.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:18.820
Is that a river?

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.560
Is that a lake?

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.260
Is that a car?

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.140
It's incredible.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:25.420
Just to be able to make these colors, these cells next to each other and make sense of

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:25.620
it.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.300
It's incredible.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.120
It really is.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.840
And it still blows my mind in some ways.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.620
So it was a natural move to go into computer vision.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.720
And what I really realized recently is that it's not that different.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:42.680
We have this video data that we're overlaying all kinds of information about what you're seeing

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.860
and you're interacting with it.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.360
It's a different kind of map is what it is.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:46.760
Yeah.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.320
Yeah.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.900
You know, I want to just dive in that for a second because I think it's so interesting

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:56.340
how much these skills that we develop and these things you feel are so specific to some

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.700
particular area, right?

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.040
Like GPS or something like that.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.920
My experience from going around and doing, I used to do in-person training classes.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.760
I remember I was one week working at Edwards Air Force Base.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.980
Then I was working at like a hedge fund in New York the next week.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.380
And I'm just like, these cannot be more different.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.540
These groups.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.960
And what I realized was I was teaching them basically the same thing.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.880
And they both needed it exactly.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.800
They both needed a lot, right?

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:28.860
And it's like, there's this sort of core of what you need to be super good at all these

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.280
ideas.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.080
And I suspect in the GIS realm, it's kind of similar, like the computer vision, the ML,

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.200
the database, you know, geospatial queries and all those kinds of things.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.440
Like everyone just needs that.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.780
And then it's like that little 20% difference that goes on top.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.420
It seems like it's the whole difference, but it's just a little bit, right?

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:45.860
Totally.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.280
Yeah.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:52.560
I guess we both chose wisely in that Python became our focus because it incorporates all

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.420
of those things and very nicely, by the way, I think.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.360
And I really do think that, yeah, it's not that different.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:05.220
And it is so cool to be able to just get this basic of programming, the basics of programming

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.420
and whatever you're passionate about.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.820
And you can just take that across fields and feel really successful and useful.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.180
Yeah.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:12.820
Yeah.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.380
It's super cool.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.380
I totally have seen it happen over and over.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.440
And I just want to highlight it because I know there's a lot of people out there listening

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.480
or knowing that would be really useful, right?

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.480
Like they probably feel like they're struggling to just make it in one area, but really that's

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.380
actually, that's the whole, that's everything.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.840
Almost all of it, right?

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.360
It's cool.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.560
Somebody said one time that what's he, like, it's amazing being a developer, but it's even

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.260
cooler in some ways being like, let's say a chemistry person who knows how to program,

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.700
you know, or for me, like environmental or water policy, knows how to program.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.280
All of a sudden you're so valuable in that office.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.960
They can't believe they live without you.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.580
And it's not that different from other types of programming, really.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.320
It's just data that you're manipulating.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.920
A lot of ETL, right?

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.860
That's, that's kind of a lot of what we do.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:55.800
And that's awesome.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.900
It's so fun.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.360
I agree.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:57.820
All right.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.340
So let's actually next spend a little time talking about some of the libraries and whatnot

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:07.240
that might be worth thinking about that are out there, the types of problems we can solve

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:07.440
with them.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.060
So you spoke about Shapely already.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.400
Maybe give us a quick rundown on Shapely again.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:11.800
Yeah.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.980
There's a team, I suppose, but headed by this one programmer.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.400
I forget his name right now.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.820
I think it's Sean.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:25.400
But anyway, Shapely and Rosterio are pure Python tools for manipulating geospatial data.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:32.180
Shapely is more about once you've read in the data into your code somehow, then you can perform

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.920
distance analysis or you can say, you know, is this car in this neighborhood?

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.240
How far has this car traveled?

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.180
How close was this car to this particular house?

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:47.100
All those questions that you might need to ask, or you might, you know, calculate demographics

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.160
across space.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:53.900
Anything that you need to do with polygons, points, and lines, which is the majority of

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.500
vector data, you're able to do with Shapely.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.020
And it's very useful in that sense.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.960
It has a really nice interop between JSON as well.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.620
Yes.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.300
Super nice.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:03.800
Right?

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.180
Yeah.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.240
You can store your data in JSON like it just naturally reads and writes that.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.080
Yeah, exactly.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.640
There's a format called well-known text as well that it reads.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.400
So it's very smart in that sense.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:18.120
And Rosterio or RosterIO, I always get that confused, is the Roster, Raster, Roster version

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:18.480
of that.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.220
I always say Roster, maybe it's Rester.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:26.760
But the other one I really like that you have here is GeoAlchemy 2, which is an add-on

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.140
to SQLAlchemy, which is amazing just in itself.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:36.700
Like SQLAlchemy is so cool to be able to write code for any particular or general database and

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.960
then be able to have the code work is incredible.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.080
I really like ORMs.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.360
I love ORMs too.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:47.500
And I think that they just make data so much more accessible and remove some of the error,

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.200
potential error that you might have in working with it.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:50.460
Right?

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.520
Like if I'm going to insert something, I don't forget to add this other part of it.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:53.720
Right?

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.440
This piece of data.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:59.420
Or you might, you know, when you load it up, you might forget to convert some value from

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.260
a string to an end or who knows.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:01.920
But right?

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:07.260
Like you build these classes and it just, you do a few simple things and you've got a really

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.180
legit app working with a database.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:09.540
Yeah.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.860
And so that's SQLAlchemy, obviously, right?

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.280
And Django has its own version, but if you're not doing Django, basically you're probably

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.100
using SQLAlchemy, which has been going strong.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.000
So GeoAlchemy, what's the story of that?

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.960
It is specific to PostgreSQL with the PostGIS spatial engine add-on, but it allows you to,

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:34.080
as you're saying, just write a database model that includes geospatial columns.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.860
So the columns that store these points, lines, and polygons that we're describing.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:44.600
And you're able to do with that module, all of these different buffers or intersections

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:50.600
or any other kind of geospatial analysis that you need to do directly with the data that

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.740
you're storing in your database.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:52.120
Nice.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.720
So if anyone's familiar with SQLAlchemy, it's exactly the same.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:00.540
Like you create a declarative base, you create an engine, you do the create tables, like all

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.500
that stuff that you do, you create a session and you add stuff to it.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:07.280
So like all those are the same, but you can have interesting stuff.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.320
Like you could define a class, which is a lake, for example.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.540
And it's got a primary key, which is an ID.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:18.220
It's got a name, which is a string, but then it could have a geometry, which is a polygon,

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.940
which is one of these things coming out of GeoAlchemy, right?

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.220
Yeah.

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.160
Well, GIS, yeah.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.100
In general.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:24.620
Yeah.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.160
Yeah.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:25.400
Yeah.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.020
Exactly.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.780
So you just create, like, it's just a different column type out of that library.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.180
Yeah.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.300
And yeah, you're out to the races.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.720
There's always a weird idea within GIS that, like, is spatial special data?

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.380
Are we specialists or are we tech people?

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.720
Like, there's always kind of a weird nebulous feeling there.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.880
And what it does in some ways is it makes spatial data not special.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.580
It makes it really easy to deal with.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.220
It's logical and stored exactly like any other data in a column.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.340
Associated features are right there in that same row.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.940
And you can do relationships with it, like just like an ID-based relationships.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.480
But you can also do spatial relationships.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:07.600
You can say, given this neighborhood, how many homes above this age or this price, let's say,

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.020
exist in that neighborhood?

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.440
You know, that kind of query.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:10.960
Yeah.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.120
And you can just treat it like just any other data, but there's just this couple of special

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.140
tweaks that allow it to be really flexible.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:22.880
And it's just more database queries, just like the session.query of, like, lake filter.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:28.540
And then it's like, excuse me, the geometry contains this point or it intersects this line.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.360
And presumably those are done with, I guess, some form of an index.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.080
So that's fast.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:34.440
Yes.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.460
I don't really know, right?

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.080
There's spatial indexing that improves it quite a bit.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:43.160
In fact, with the right engine underneath your database, these queries go fast for millions

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:43.700
of points.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.920
Postgres is pretty, pretty amazing for being a free digger.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.280
It's pretty awesome.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:47.620
Yeah.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.260
Yeah.

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:49.700
Yeah.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.560
It is super cool.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.960
You know, we were talking a little bit about it earlier.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.240
Like Tinder, you know, all these modern apps are geospatial because they've just integrated,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.060
you know, where you are, where are the object that you're interested in, or like Uber.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.460
Like, you know, nobody understood what I was saying when I said GIS.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:08.020
But when I finally was like, oh, it's like Uber, you know, you see where you are and you see

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.740
the car coming to you, which is...

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:14.120
And you see the roads where it can go and maybe even optimize a path if it's like a

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.820
shared Uber, whatever that is called.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.440
All of those are geospatial.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.720
Sure, they don't share anymore, but they used to.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.420
I know, right?

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:21.620
Yeah.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.580
They used to work together when they had to.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.120
Yeah.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:28.820
So it's built into our modern lives in ways like you were talking about mapping, you know,

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:34.240
but it's mapping plus information overlay and sorting through that information to find the

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.100
things that are interesting to you across a varied and unique space that you may not be

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:39.700
familiar with.

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:40.420
A new city.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:40.820
Yeah.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.340
Yeah.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:48.020
Well, when you were first talking about studying your master's degree in geography, just thinking

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.920
back of when I was in middle school or something, I was like, well, what you're going to have

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.060
to do is name all the states in the US.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.420
You have to name all the countries in Europe.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:00.200
Like, okay, well, not super interesting, but I guess I'll like, I'll commit that to memory

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.980
and we'll just, we're going to do this, right?

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.440
And then probably forget most of them.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.420
And, you know, that's kind of was my like young mind's impression of that.

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:07.840
Yeah.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:12.800
But, you know, if you think of like space overlaid with flowing data and all the questions

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.200
and answers that you have, all of a sudden it becomes this really interesting programming

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.480
problem and a really important for people's lives.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.220
Well, let me have a quick diversion here.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.820
So back in the thirties, especially there was a lot of geographers hired to like make flood

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.360
maps or other kinds of maps.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.440
They were trying to figure out like, where are disparities across space and how can we help

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:31.780
people?

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.400
And it was a top level science.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.520
Geography had departments all across like Harvard, Yale, all of those schools.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:44.260
But then to be honest, there was like a supposed like homosexual scandal at one of these schools

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:48.960
where like, you know, a geography professor was living with one of his grad students and

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:54.580
president who had skepticism around the science itself kind of decided just to cut it out.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.940
And because like he gave a different reason for it, but that was the rumor behind it all.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:35:59.700
Oh my gosh.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.080
Yeah.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.700
So it was Harvard or Yale.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:02.440
They cut it out.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.480
And then all the other top IVs followed.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:09.360
But in most other countries, geography is a top level study because you're really understanding

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.860
like, why are these people suffering from pollution more than these people next to them?

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.060
What are the prevailing winds?

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.620
What are the reasons that they live there?

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:21.480
What are the historical, you know, why were black communities affected by freeways in the

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.220
seventies more than other communities?

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:27.840
You know, it was partially their political power, partially where they were living because the

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.480
elevation was flatter and it was more prone to floods.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.740
There's just all these geographic questions that are kind of amazing to study and you can

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:39.640
get hyper-specific with it, but didn't appeal apparently to these top level schools until

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.800
around 2005 when Harvard started its spatial library.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.220
And that was like a GIS focused library.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:50.820
And they brought back geography or at least some component of it that was tangible to them.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.220
Oh, wow.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:51.520
Yeah.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.700
I had no idea about that history.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.900
Nobody does.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.700
It is sort of a unique component to this like science.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.800
That's everywhere and nowhere.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.460
No pun intended, really.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.100
Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.320
So we talked about geo-alchemy.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.780
There's a geo-alchemy there.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.420
It's called geo-alchemy 2.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.560
What happened to 1?

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.840
Or no suffix.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.300
Do you know?

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.420
Go straight to 2.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:15.100
You know, whoever started 1 abandoned it and somebody else took it over.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:15.540
Yeah.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:15.820
Yeah.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.920
But they didn't want to edge it out or say, all right, we'll call it 2.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.200
Yeah.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.980
If we're in Django, we have geo-django.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.260
That sounds better.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:22.840
Geo-django.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.580
Sounds fun.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.300
But maybe it's got to live within the Django models and stuff like that.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:27.720
Yeah.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.580
Obviously, if you're using Django, you probably would consider that.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.020
It's actually right built in.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.640
You just have to import one more thing in your admin.py.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.800
I believe that's what it's called.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.260
Or I haven't used geo-django in a few years.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.580
But it's like, you know, right from the get-go, when Adrian and his buddy were designing Django,

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:48.740
they were doing the EveryBlock project that they ended up selling to CBS, which was kind

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:53.480
of like a citizen app in 2007 where they were saying, like, here's what's happening on every

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.260
block in America.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.900
And so, geography was built in early into Django.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.780
Oh, interesting.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.160
I had no idea about that history.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:00.480
Yeah.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.040
I mean, Django comes out of newsrooms, right?

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:03.180
Yeah.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:06.780
It came from the lore and internal world or something like that.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:10.540
So, it makes total sense that it would have that, some of those ideas in there.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.000
Yeah.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.220
As soon as he left, Adrian, I forget his last name right now.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.580
Anyway, he started EveryBlock and I think he did well selling that.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.300
It was like a huge part, as you said, and it's very much related to reporting.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.780
So, I was like, yeah.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:27.340
I'm more into Flask these days, which it's just kind of simple and you can just add what

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.480
you need when you need it.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.820
No disrespect to Django.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.560
Django's fantastic.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:30.900
Yeah.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.120
So, if you're in Flask, GeoAlchemy too, obviously, right?

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:34.480
Yep.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.840
But if you're in Django, probably you just use the features that are

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.860
built straight into it, right?

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.840
Tons of tutorials about it all around.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.140
Yeah.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.340
It was well supported.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:41.800
Yeah.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:48.400
So, you have some that are on ArcGIS, which is the Esri commercial package, which they actually

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:53.400
do a ton with Python as well over Esri, which, so if you're doing Python, you might, it might

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.940
still be a great place to be, but it's also, you know, something you pay for.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.200
So, you might alternatively consider some of the piecing together things from some of the

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.100
open source tools, right?

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.580
But yeah.

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.540
So, tell us about your books.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:02.960
Sure.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.320
Yeah.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:09.280
I got the opportunity, having volunteered to review some books in like 2012, an early

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.420
open source Python GIS book.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.100
It was great.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:16.940
And I was on PAC Publishers list and they kept emailing me like, can you write a book about

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.240
network security and Python?

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.700
And I was just thinking, no, I can't.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.080
I don't know anything about that at all.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.700
How about cutting edge cryptography?

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.400
Have you done that?

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:24.640
Yeah.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:24.920
Exactly.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.580
I also know.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.240
Sounds like you've got the same emails, huh?

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.060
Yep.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.740
So, I finally wrote back to them.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.460
I was like, look, I am a GIS professional and I can write about that.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.400
If you have any interest, let me know.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.800
Otherwise, stop emailing me.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.700
And they said, yeah, actually we do.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:45.600
So, they recruited me to write a book on ArcPy, which was at that point about five years old,

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.720
but it was just getting more and more prominence.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.260
And I was obviously an early proponent.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:56.060
And I wrote that first book, ArcPy and ArcGIS, Geospatial Analysis with Python, which we did

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.800
a second version of me and my coworker, Dara.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:05.260
And that one focused more on the newer ArcGIS Pro, which uses the Python library for that as

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:05.900
Python 3.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.840
The problem with ArcPy is it's Python 2 based.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:14.320
So, it'll be supported for a while in terms of Esri, but the greater Python world is rapidly

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.280
leaving it behind.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:15.660
Yeah.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.880
There are some interesting industries that kind of get stuck.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:24.180
They so embrace Python, but they embrace it in a way where they package it into their tooling.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.420
And I'm thinking of the movie and entertainment workflow industry.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.920
There's all these tools like Maya and whatnot that have Python built in.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.220
And a lot of them embedded the Python 2 runtime.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:41.240
And they're just, until they as a group decide to change, they're like, that's how it is,

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:41.520
you know?

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.460
Yeah, exactly.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:48.100
You know, Esri keeps trying to retire its ArcMap product in favor of this new ArcGIS Pro.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:53.260
But it's not going to happen because they have a huge sort of lazy, let's say, no offense,

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.080
workforce that doesn't want to learn a whole new software.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.100
And I totally get it.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:02.380
Yeah, maybe they have stuff that works and they don't consider building those things

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.760
or maintaining their job.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.580
They just need that to work for their job, right?

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.640
And that's good for them, but it's a tough place to be.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:14.200
They wrote this software called Avenue, which was their original programming language or one

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.560
of them in the early aughts.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.420
And people are still using some of those scripts, I'm sure, in places.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.120
So, you know, things stick if they work, just like you said.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.060
And it makes sense.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.180
Yeah, so you took another take on this.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.340
Yeah, and it was fun.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:31.560
I actually recruited some help because writing books is a lot on Twitter and found a couple

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.200
guys that I follow on Twitter.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:39.660
And we wrote this book, Mastering Geospatial Analysis with Python 3, which is like a 16-chapter

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.180
review of available modules.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:47.440
Does a pretty good job of going from like very specific geospatial stuff all the way up to big

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:47.840
data.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:52.240
And there's a couple chapters in there on interactive web mapping that I wrote around

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.160
Flask and GeoAlchemy as well as GeoDjango.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.400
I thought it was great.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.700
We even touched on, do you know what MapD, they became OmniSci.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.840
It's sort of a...

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:02.420
Oh, I don't know.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:08.380
It's like a GPU database tool that does some pretty amazing visualizations.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.640
And they have a Python module, PyMapD.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.680
They may have changed the name.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.700
Yes, things like that.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.940
Like all these incredibly cool modules that just kind of blew me away.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.700
We just touched on it really because there's so much to touch on.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.200
But I think it's a great book.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.040
I really liked writing it and it's so wide.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.360
Well, it sounds like it really does a good coverage of all these things if you're into

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.980
Python plus geospatial.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:30.980
Yeah.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:31.540
Well, yeah.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.320
It's not like it's selling like hotcakes or anything.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.120
You know, these...

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.220
Well, not before your appearance on the podcast.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:38.900
Yeah, there you go.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.200
Yeah.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:39.520
Yeah.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.620
I'll be looking for those checks rolling in, right?

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.140
That's right.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:43.720
Yeah.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.760
I would say it's only 30% like the App Store.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.420
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.960
No, just kidding.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:55.620
But speaking of podcasts, you spent close to a year doing a podcast on GIS topics, right?

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.220
I did.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.280
And that was a joy.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.380
I mean, it's fun being back here and remembering how much fun this is.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:04.180
My co-host, Todd Barr, who is the spatial punk.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:09.060
He's sort of Esri's aside and the thorn of Esri is sort of his like thing.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:15.260
And, you know, he's just criticizing like the lack of support for big data and just really

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:19.040
innovative or any kind of innovation the way he sees it.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:24.020
I think like there's some great tools coming out of Esri like ArcPy and ArcServer is very

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:24.320
cool.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.900
But he felt like within the realm, they had too much dominance and not enough like push

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:35.080
towards really cool, new and fast pipeline supports, especially for big data.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:40.200
So we had a lot of discussions with all kinds of different users, though, around like different

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:44.180
focuses, cartography to big data to archaeology.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:50.100
We had a journalist up in my hometown who does like a, it's a Django based website that gets

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.540
like 3 million hits a month.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:57.820
And they use a lot of GeoDjango to like locate where all the different, say, arrests or accidents

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:58.260
happen.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:03.140
They just pull in records from the courthouse and automatically add location to it.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:07.260
It's one of those things like you were saying about just adding in just a little bit of Geo

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.780
that makes your field, whatever it is, way better.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:11.160
Yeah.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:16.440
I recently did an episode on Python and AI ML in journalism.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.780
And there was a lot of geospatial stuff there as well about like automatically understanding,

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:27.320
you know, like earthquakes in real time or crime in real time and those types of things as

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:27.480
well.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.000
So yeah, I think it spans a lot.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.160
Have you heard of a hood line down here?

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:31.740
Hood line?

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:32.060
No.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:33.260
They've gone national.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:37.080
In fact, I think they were purchased by Nextdoor, but it is a journal.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.720
It's like a local neighborhood journalism site focused on all kinds of different cities,

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.820
but it started here actually in the neighborhood.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.500
I live in San Francisco in the lower Haight.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:51.360
And it was all about trying to automate a lot of the like exposition within a story.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.640
If like a restaurant opened or something, they could tell you about all the other restaurants

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.960
that opened within a certain radius, that kind of thing.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.680
So machine learning and ghostwriting a lot of their stories was a big focus.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.420
I thought it was amazing.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:01.820
Oh, yeah.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.440
How interesting.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.420
That makes perfect sense for Nextdoor, of course.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.180
They're trying to like hyper local stuff.

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.760
Maybe just give us a quick couple of your favorite episodes for your podcast.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.020
People, I'll link to the show and people can check it out if they're interested.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:18.200
The cartography one with Sarah Bell was really fun because we talked to her about just kind

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:22.920
of, you know, cartography and her GIS career, but also like what it's like being a woman in

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:27.180
the field and how she's loved it and hated it at times.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.320
That one really resonated.

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:32.360
I thought the journalism one was fascinating because, you know, we're talking about all kinds

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.580
of different crazy stories that they've covered.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.820
For instance, they did a, you know, where I'm from, Humboldt County, there's a lot of

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.780
marijuana up there.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:44.020
And so they did like a comparison with satellite imagery saying like, do you think this satellite

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.700
has marijuana grown in it?

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:50.140
And it pissed off all the locals, but it made for an amazing like application through their

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.040
website.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:46:00.500
It's kind of a crazy mix of GIS and crime and reporting, which is just such a fascinating

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.740
way to approach the world because that's really how things work.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.100
You know, things are located somewhere.

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:05.420
Yeah.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:09.200
And a lot of those things are affected by the location that you're in, right?

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:15.620
Quality of schools, the attitude or predispositions the police might have and perceiving the people

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.260
in that neighborhood may vary a lot, right?

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:19.140
Things like that.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:19.660
Oh, yeah.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.280
You know, you can tell these stories with data, right?

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:22.580
Yeah.

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:27.940
Well, I was, so the CEO of Hoodline, when she brought me on as a consultant, I was encouraging

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:33.580
her like, you have to know every gang territory in LA, you know, like that's the kind of thing

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:37.020
that would really make for an amazing story, especially for automating it.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:40.660
So we never went that far with it, but I think there's still room to do that.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:40.960
Yeah.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.140
I guess there probably would, right?

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.820
Yeah.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.520
So the Mappiest Hour was really fun.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.500
And Todd was a great co-host.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.780
We're still talking about doing some more maybe next year, but it was a very big year for

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.120
us both.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:52.280
Yeah.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.820
So you had, you had season one and then maybe you could do season two.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.540
There you go.

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:56.880
Yeah.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.280
Well, with this kind of encouragement, I'm loving this.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.480
So yeah, maybe I'll just ride this wave.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.460
Call them out.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.620
It's always fun.

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:04.800
Yeah.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.240
You're just like sort of a bit of a sidebar with fellow podcaster.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.820
Like it's really interesting that the people that you get to meet, right?

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:17.380
If there's so many folks that I've spoken to that generally, at least before I got into

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:21.280
the podcast, you know, five years ago would have not really bothered to give me the time

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.700
of day, or at least they wouldn't have been excited about it.

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:23.960
Right.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.160
And now I, almost everyone I reach out to is excited to be part of the show, to share

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.940
their story, to talk, and you just get to meet so many interesting people.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.040
It's just such an honor to sort of be part of that.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:34.240
Right.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:34.660
It's cool.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.440
Oh my God.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.280
It really is.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.140
I'm loving this.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.880
And you must have just so much fun.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.540
You're doing this full-time now or?

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.560
Full-time.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:41.940
Yeah.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:42.760
Two shows a week.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.040
Yeah.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:43.380
It's great.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.240
Oh, that's great.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:49.900
It's just such a cool dive into who we as developers are, which is much more, much less

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.900
monolithic than it sounds like initially.

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:55.280
And there's just so many different ways and things you can do with code.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:55.540
Yeah.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:00.440
And you touched so much on it when you talked about that person who, not necessarily a CS grad,

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.820
but some other expertise, but now has the magic programming power that

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:05.560
most people don't.

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:10.480
And there's just so many interesting stories and use cases and libraries and applications

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.660
coming out of that side of the world that it's bottomless.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:14.020
It's cool.

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:17.020
Just got to grasp what a for loop is and you're well on your way.

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:18.480
Exactly.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.760
Pip install and you're going to be good.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.120
All right.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:21.540
Let's see.

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:26.740
One more thing that we threw out to talk about was WebGIS for Flask or Django APIs.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:27.920
Tell us maybe about that real quick.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:33.740
Well, you can just do some amazing APIs with Flask or Django in general, but with Geo, especially

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:37.540
with if you're building like a phone, an iPhone app or an Android app, you know, you can just

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:43.220
send your location and have all kinds of context sent back to the application based on these

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:43.880
APIs.

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.320
So they're quick to put up.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.140
They're easy to maintain and you can integrate spatial right into it.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.620
It really isn't that much work.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:54.780
There's a little bit deeper understanding of like the type of spatial function you may

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.140
need for a specific moment.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.780
But none of that is going to take a master's degree.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:02.940
In fact, I think just like reading some online tutorials or some stack.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:06.040
There's a Geo stack overflow even, I think.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:06.480
Oh, cool.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:06.940
Yeah.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.560
The GIS dot stack overflow.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.360
Something like that is very, very useful.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.300
A stack exchange.

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:11.560
Yeah.

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.060
Probably.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:12.620
There you go.

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:13.180
That's it.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:13.440
Yeah.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:13.720
Yeah.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.640
Or you can buy my books.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.660
Yeah.

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:21.580
Now, the amount of data that you have to exchange is actually pretty small for these applications.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.920
Like where am I or what path have I taken?

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.500
Yeah.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:25.240
And so on.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.440
But it's easy to build APIs random.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:32.280
I would suspect like on the back end, have it something like Geo SQL, Geo Alchemy 2.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.480
Just indexes.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.580
Make sure you have indexes.

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:39.500
The coolest thing I ended up doing at Zillow was building what we called the Surveyor.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:44.520
It was just a working title, but it was a just literally a web map built in Flask, PostGIS,

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.720
to be able to actually see a lot of the data that we were building and creating and comparing.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:56.040
Because internally, we didn't have like a mapping tool that could really speak to all of the geospatial data that we had.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.720
It was such a surprise to me.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.580
And I ended up winning the Hack Week there earlier this year before I left.

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:06.000
And that was just like so fun because I presented it at the end of Hack Week.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.680
And they instantly were like, yes, why don't we have this already?

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.100
That's awesome.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.160
That's super cool.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:11.660
Congratulations.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:15.820
One more thing on the library side, I guess, is probably worth throwing out.

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.160
So we've talked a lot about server side things.

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.740
And you talked about your cool experiences with JavaScript in the front end.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:25.860
If I'm going to do mapping data, especially interactive maps,

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:30.580
there's got to be some fancy library that goes on the front end that makes this happen.

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:33.200
So what would you recommend to check out?

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:33.760
Sure.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:39.400
Yeah, there's less fancier ones, I would say, that Leaflet is considered, which is a JavaScript library.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:44.000
It's considered a medium level knowledge that you could use.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:51.180
And then MapGL, Mapbox GL, I'm sorry, is a little bit higher level, but it has really fine controls over what you can do.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.300
And you can have all kinds of events.

00:50:54.540 --> 00:51:02.320
There are some pure Python front end tools like Dash and a few others that do have mapping integrated as well as graphs.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.300
And that can be really useful.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.680
You don't have to handle much of the HTML if you don't want to.

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:14.720
But I find it, if you're going to get into interactive web mapping, really useful to know both Python and JavaScript to make them work together.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.140
Yeah.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:19.680
A lot of the interactive stuff happens on, it has to happen on the client side, right?

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:19.800
Yeah.

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.020
So that means some kind of JavaScript.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.120
Get used to curly braces, right?

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.420
Yeah, exactly.

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.480
Don't forget the semicolons.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.360
Actually, in JavaScript, you can forget them, which is kind of good, I guess.

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:34.540
It took me a long time to get into JavaScript because I was so used to the clean nature of Python.

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.340
Like, and no joke, that attracted me to Python.

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.640
It was so important to be able to read the code.

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.180
Yeah, and I feel like JavaScript used to be closer to that world.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.180
It used to be pretty simple.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:46.840
Now it's like, you know, all sorts of dependencies require this.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:51.260
And then like, you know, you pack up these things and it's just like, oh my gosh.

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:56.780
Or, you know, you pre-compile or transpile your TypeScript over to this and then you pack it up and you minify.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.860
It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.580
What happened to just including something in the page?

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:08.160
I mean, when I do demos or proof of concept, it's always pretty vanilla with like one mapping library or something.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:13.280
There's some other cool ones too that Uber is putting out a ton of really cool stuff like deck.gl.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.140
And there's another one I forget.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:22.160
But if you want to get into super fancy data visualization, I recommend looking into Uber's set of JavaScript tools.

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.340
It's pretty amazing stuff.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:32.020
But yeah, I prefer a much more vanilla implementation of myself just for my brain to manage it and to understand it.

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.220
Yeah, super cool.

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:37.940
All right, let me close out our conversation with one sort of more general question here.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:43.720
So people out there listening, a lot of them have Python skills, obviously, or building up their Python skills.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:53.140
How much do you need to know to be useful and powerful?

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.580
Like, do you need to go get a degree?

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.020
How much work is it to get into this?

00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:10.920
If you want to really understand the theories behind geography, yeah, I think grad school can be really useful or just an undergrad degree because it really helps you understand like just why it's cold in the Arctic and warm at the equator.

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.140
Like just at that basic level.

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:13.080
It is amazing.

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:17.200
And the relationship between the two and the relationship between that and human culture.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.640
So if you want to really understand humans, yes, go into geography.

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:30.440
But if you want to make a geospatial data pipeline, I think what you really have to know is just like what is the data you're getting in and what is the data you want to get out and what are your resources in between.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.420
You don't have to know much more than that.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:33.920
There's all kinds of tutorials.

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.740
There's books.

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.600
There's a weekend of exploration ahead of you.

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.900
It's not that hard, but it is really powerful.

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.620
Well, it does sound like a really fun area to get into.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:49.660
And a lot of times these visual aspects are pretty cool for people who are not sure that they're necessarily programmers.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:54.920
But then if you build something that you can see and touch and share, like all of a sudden it makes a big difference, I find.

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.620
Completely agree.

00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.960
It's one of the coolest things you do.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:03.720
And I still get that thrill I got, you know, from showing my grandmother the little lat long that I was able to pull from a shape file.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.140
Super cool.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:07.020
All right.

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:11.140
Now, before I let you out of here, you got to answer the two questions I always put at the end of the show.

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:13.600
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.120
Lately, it is PyCharm.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.120
I really like it.

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:20.020
Before that, it was sublime because it's just simple and you don't have to think too much about it.

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.380
But PyCharm is fantastic.

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:21.720
Yeah.

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:22.820
It's my favorite as well.

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:23.160
I love it.

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.240
And notable PyPI package.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.860
I mean, we definitely threw a bunch out there.

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:36.880
I think PyShape is the lowest level one because unfortunately still this really ancient data format is the major data format in

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:37.180
GIS.

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:42.240
So PySHP, that tool will allow you to read and write it just in pure Python.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:42.740
Awesome.

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:43.260
Cool.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:43.780
All right.

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.320
So final call to action, people are interested in GIS.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.360
What do you say to them?

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:47.860
And Python.

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:48.980
It's an amazing field.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:49.640
How do I put those together?

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.040
Yeah.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:50.800
This is the future.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.000
Or maybe the future is here.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.900
But either way, there's so much that can be done in this space.

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.380
We're just touching on it.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:01.280
People are just hearing about it, let alone realizing that there's so much more to do with it.

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.460
So, yes, come join me.

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:02.700
Yeah.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.260
It definitely feels like maybe the future is here.

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:06.680
It feels like part of the future.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:13.940
Like I remember so many of these things, the GPS stuff, the Zillow stuff, all those different just literally blew my mind when I saw them.

00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:17.300
And I'm reminded of the William Gibson quote.

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.400
Like the future is here.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.000
It's just not evenly distributed.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:20.620
Exactly.

00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:21.080
Yeah.

00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:21.520
Yeah.

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.320
That is so true.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:26.480
The future is generally in your hands these days, but not everybody has the same phone.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:26.960
That's true.

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:27.440
That's true.

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:27.800
All right.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.020
Well, Silas, thank you for being on the show.

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:29.820
It was great to chat with you.

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:30.680
It was so fun, Michael.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.320
Thank you so much.

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:31.560
Yeah.

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:31.720
Yeah.

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.260
Thanks for sharing this.

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:32.620
See ya.
