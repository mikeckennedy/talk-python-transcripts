Not everyone comes to software development and Python through four-year computer science programs

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:10.320
at universities. This episode highlights one alternative journey into Python. Over the course

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.560
of two episodes, you will meet people who started in other industries and specializations and now

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.220
make Python part of their daily experience. Some of them have used programming to power up their

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.180
specialization. Others decided they'd rather just be doing programming full-time and made that switch

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.840
over. This episode is part one of a two-part series. Our guests this time are Derek Chambers,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.340
Jim Taysom, Arash Shoheli, and Rob Ward. This is Talk Python To Me, episode 173, recorded July 25th,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.040
2018.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.080
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.820
they're offering during their segments. It really helps support the show. Derek, Jim, Arash, and Rob,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.600
welcome all of you to Talk Python.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.520
Thanks for having us.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.040
Thank you.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.740
Great to be here.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.220
Thank you.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.220
You're welcome. It's good to have you all here. I'm really excited about this short series of shows

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.080
that I'm doing on people getting into programming in Python from other disciplines like chemical

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.720
engineering or accounting, things like that. So I guess we'll get started by kind of setting the stage

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.140
and talking about where you're coming from because you're not really full-time developers.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.340
you're doing other stuff and using development as kind of a superpower. So I guess the first thing I

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.780
want to ask you guys is what is your industry? What is your specialization? What do you study? What

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.020
are you doing day to day? And I guess we'll start with Derek.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.140
Great. Well, I'm a mining engineer who studies earthquakes and works for the Centers for Disease

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.840
Control. So I usually get a lot of blank stares when I introduce myself that way. Essentially,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.420
the Centers for Disease Control has a group that does occupational safety and health research,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.740
and I work within that group studying the mining industry.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.840
That sounds really interesting. What kind of background do you have to work in this? Did

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.920
you go and get like a bachelor's degree in mining and geology?

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.980
Yeah. So I have a bachelor's degree in mining engineering and then I did my master's work in

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.500
geophysics.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.760
Very awesome. Jim, how about yourself?

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.560
I work for Radiant Solutions. We're federal contractors in the DC area. My background is as a

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.980
geographer. I got my bachelor's degree in geography with a focus on geographic information systems.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.160
And more recently, I've been transitioning into a full-time developer role because of picking up

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.100
Python and all the things that's led me to.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.340
Yeah, that's pretty awesome. You know, I had a similar path. I studied something else and I just

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.100
did more and more programming until I'm just like, why am I doing that other stuff?

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.420
But are you still doing programming around GIS? I know Python and GIS are like a really good fit.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.380
ArcGIS and the Esri folks do a lot with Python, for example.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.080
Yeah. So I'm still very involved in the GIS community. The project that I'm on is very GIS

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.280
centric, although I'm doing more of like the web backend for the project right now.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.880
Okay, cool. Arash, how about you?

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.900
Yeah, I'm working for MarketSmart and we do like software and services for nonprofit organizations

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.300
exclusively. And I was traditionally trained as a organic chemist, but I've pretty much transitioned

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.780
over now. So I'm not really involved in doing really chemistry anymore. Maybe in the future,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.380
I'll maybe get back to a cross section of doing something with software and chemistry, but I'm

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.580
pretty much doing software engineering now full-time and not really as much doing it, not really doing

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.560
any chemistry anymore.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.940
That's pretty interesting. How do you feel that studying like a science, like a hard science

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.300
background sort of helped you become a programmer or did it not help at all?

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.780
I think it helped. And what I realized is the skill that I had as a scientist is basically

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.780
the scientific method and the problem solving approach is actually exactly the same as software

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.580
engineering. When I came over, I realized that the approach to solving problems, you know, forming

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.980
a hypothesis, researching what's out there, testing something, feedback loop. That's literally

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.740
what I did in as organic chemist every day. And so the same process is really applied to

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.160
software engineering. It's really the tool set that's changed. Obviously, I'm a guy chemist,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.280
so you're in the lab messing with chemicals, trying to make stuff. And in software engineering,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.760
you know, you have a computer and you're trying to build software, but the approach to how you're

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.180
going about solving a problem was actually the same. And it actually really, I think, kind

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.180
of helped me be able to make that transition.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.080
Yeah. I had it, like I said, a similar background. And I feel like, you know, people will joke like,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.640
Michael, you almost got your PhD in math, but does that seem like a waste? Right? And I don't

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.520
think it was. I think like those types of thought processes are really, really similar. And like you

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.280
say, the problem solving and stuff like that. So I think it prepares you pretty well. Yeah. So Rob,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.780
how about yourself?

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:13.560
Yeah. So I got my bachelor's in accounting and had some accounting jobs early in my career. And I've

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.340
always been technically savvy and kind of along the way, I got exposed to SQL and that kind of led to,

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.180
Hey, this is kind of cool and more interesting than accounting. And then from there decided I wanted

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.220
to learn Python. And I will say like some of the others, I am not doing accounting anymore. I'm a data

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:38.340
analyst. So working my way towards data science and working on a master's in analytics. So that's cool.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.040
So you're still going to school for your master's degree right now. How far along are you?

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.640
Right. Right. I'm about a year and a half in and I got a year left. So I'm just taking one class at a

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.260
time. Just keep it simple. Yeah. No reason to go full time. Right. Yeah. Kids and all that. But,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.340
but yeah, from an accounting standpoint, I did actually use Python when I was still doing accounting

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.520
work a few years ago, which, you know, we can get into more a little later. Yeah. Sounds good.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.260
So I guess maybe go back in reverse order with you, Rob. If you're in accounting, you know,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.160
Excel is programmable, right? People do ridiculous stuff. I think I've seen a flight simulator created

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.620
in Excel. Have you seen this? I have not seen that. There's a pretty intense stuff done in Excel.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.940
So, you know, it's probably like the natural place to do like automation and stuff like that. So why do

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:30.280
you learn Python and programming? I had years ago, I had, I tried to learn C and that failed miserably.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.880
I mean, it's hard, man. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, what is this stuff? And so then I kind of decided

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.580
again, you know, data science was starting to become a thing and I knew I wanted more of a

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.320
business intelligence or data analyst type of role. I was doing accounting and, not the name drop,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.360
but my brother works for GitHub. So he's like, you should learn Python. I'm like, okay, I'll learn Python.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.080
So, you know, I think it was about, it was five years ago and, I just started on,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.480
I think it was that learn Python the hard way, which I know that's going to be controversial

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.760
to some people, but, it was a good starter. And then also took some Coursera courses. They have a

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.480
lot of Python, courses, got through about half of it until I got to, object oriented programming and

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:23.280
was a little dumbfounded at the time. And, I was able to, to see the value and see that there

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.500
were things that could be applied to things I was doing every day in my accounting work,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.200
which I don't know if you want to get into that right now or a little later.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.840
Yeah. Let's get into it maybe a little bit later, but I think there's definitely some really cool,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.260
like automation of, of sort of Excel and processing of those files. And there's lots of

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.120
cool stuff in there. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. We'll dig into that. So Arash, why did you get into

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.720
programming in Python? You were in the lab, your hands are already got like gloves on. It's hard to

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.180
type. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I mean, honestly, I went down a path where I was trying to do

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.080
in chemistry, but I got into pharmaceuticals and, and I started not liking the big companies in the

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:05.820
pharmaceuticals. I thought about, academics and it was not looking good as a very few jobs.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.800
Funding is kind of bad. And I'd always been interested in technology and I was doing some

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.340
web development, not really much programming, but I was doing that stuff. I was getting more and more.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.080
And then eventually I kind of just, I don't know. I've always been someone that,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.620
that kind of takes chances. And so I kind of just was like, well, let me try to see if I can,

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.880
you know, work my way into, into this field. And I kind of, and I got there and I kind of

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.600
pulled myself up, and learned and, and made it through. So it was really kind of been the

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.160
industry of, of chemistry, at least for me, didn't really kind of, kind of failed me.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.400
At least for me. Yeah. But actually the Excel thing you were talking about, I will say something.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:46.340
We actually had an entire application here. We built Marcus Smart out of this, Excel. We had this,

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.520
uh, this guy who was working for one of these nonprofits who had this crazy Excel file

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.940
that he, nonprofits would send him his data and he would just, had this,

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.620
basically these macros he had written and it would take like, some of it would take like a data run.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.900
And he finally came to us and we talked to him. He's like, you know, this is, this is awesome.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.340
People are sending me this stuff. They love this thing, but it takes me so long to run. I'm like,

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.180
can you put, make the software as it? We're like, yes, that's what it should be for. So we actually

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.020
built an entire application. it's called the fundraising report card.com that is out of,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.060
came born out of literally of Excel files. That's awesome. Yeah. I think there's so much

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:29.740
programming happens in Excel, honestly. So one thing I wanted to ask you coming from on that path,

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.800
do you feel, I know a lot of people talk about imposter syndrome, not coming with a computer

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.180
science degree. Was that a problem for you or were you okay with, did you feel like, do I belong in

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.440
this programming world? Like how do I sort of prove that I earned my chops here? Yeah. Yeah. No,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.360
I think that's real. I mean, I think people feel it. I've definitely felt that. I think the first

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.120
year was really tough because there was a lot of nomenclature, a lot of words. I just didn't

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.540
understand. And literally there was a moment I, even though it was an accumulation, I literally

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:04.140
remember a moment after a year where one day it just kind of like clicked and I was like, okay,

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:10.020
I understand. Like, I don't understand. I don't know everything, but now I can understand. I can read

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.860
an article. I can go through something and comprehend and work my way through it. Where before,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.120
you know, I would get lost sometimes just completely not understand concepts. So I think

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.680
it's real. And you got to, you know, read, read, read. I read constantly and you got to just always

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:30.680
train yourself and always be training. So to keep, and I think at some point you get over that to a

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.040
level, you're like, okay, I think I got, you know, through it. So yeah, I think it's, I mean,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.260
you got, and you got to work through it. Yeah. I agree with that. I feel like once you get to the

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:43.200
point where you've learned enough new things repeatedly, you're like, there's a lot of stuff I don't know,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.920
but if I need to know it, I can learn it really quickly. And once you kind of get that skill and

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.100
experience, I think the posture syndrome really fades pretty quickly. But yeah, if you don't like

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.780
continuously learning, this is not the industry that's going to work out so well.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:00.100
Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think learning is, is a, and things change so much in software engineering,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:05.440
I mean, almost on a weekly basis that you, you better be ready to be learning all the new stuff

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.160
and at least keep up to date with it.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.240
Yeah, for sure. Jim, I think probably your introduction may be the simplest. If you're

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.580
in GIS, you almost have to learn Python to do some of that stuff, right? But what, what was the

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.300
motivation for you?

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:23.160
So for me, the first couple of years of doing GIS, I didn't really need to use Python at all. I ended up

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:29.000
in some mandatory training that I didn't need. And so I would spend hours and hours and hours every day,

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:35.740
just completely bored out of my mind. So I started going through all the ArcGIS documentation on how

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:42.060
to use ArcPy and started teaching myself Python enough that within my realm, I was willing to put

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:49.320
it on my resume. And then there was another position at work that needed someone who knew Python because

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:56.120
they had this old VBA application that was written for ArcGIS that they needed to replace because

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.120
Esri was...

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.580
Because it's VB6.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.380
I don't even remember what it was.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.200
Or VBA or whatever it was, yeah.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:07.860
They needed someone that could take what they had and recreate it in Python because Esri had been

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:14.240
telegraphing for a while that they were going to be dropping VB support. And so it was more than I

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.140
was ready for, but they couldn't find anyone else. And so I just told my boss, I was like,

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.120
I can do the project, you just have to give me at least a little bit of time every week so I can

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:29.260
do some at-home Python training and figure this out. And I did it and loved it and started doing

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:29.840
more of it.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.960
That's really cool. It's cool how you're able to sort of laterally move in your company because

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.240
of it too. It's not great to be stuck in mandatory training that's super boring, but at least you

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.120
made a really good use of it.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.700
Yes. I use my time well.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.100
Awesome. Derek, how about you? What was the motivation for getting into programming?

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.980
Yeah. I first got into programming when I started graduate school and I had an advisor

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:54.100
that was really hands-off. And so his charge was kind of just go figure out something new

00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:01.240
and novel and useful and do it. So I ended up changing my research topic, I think three or

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.960
four times, but I was finding that it was very hard to use some of the existing tools that I'd

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.980
known to build sort of a larger system that would do something interesting. And so I run across this

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:19.200
Python package called obspy, which implements a lot of format parsers and data classes for handling

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.880
seismology data. And so once I found that, I got into Python and I was able to build this bigger

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.960
system that actually looked at implementing a newer method for detecting very small seismic events.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.980
Like micro earthquake type things?

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.800
Yeah, exactly. The typical seismicity associated with mining is pretty small, so you have to have some

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.020
clever methods for detecting it in most cases.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.320
Nice. And you said that you're now a contributor to that project, right?

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.900
That's right. Yeah. I'm a maintainer for obspy. I really enjoy when I can find some spare time,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.020
you know, making improvements or suggesting different things we can do in the future.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:59.740
Yeah, that's awesome. So what are my feelings about sort of people becoming programmers and having

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.480
these skills is it's great to just have like a computer science degree. You can solve problems and

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:11.200
programming stuff. But I think the real value of many more people having programming skills and Python

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:17.920
skills is like it's kind of a superpower for the thing that you do do. So I wanted to ask you all

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:24.860
sort of how you saw that in your industry. I know not all of you are still doing that day to day, but you know,

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.460
it sounds like all of you sort of got started in programming while you were still in that industry.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.980
So Rob, what do you think about this sort of power up idea?

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:41.380
No, yes, I can attest to that firsthand because in my last job that was truly an accounting job,

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:49.320
I was I was the accounting manager for a small company in my hometown. And we had they were a

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:57.720
property manager and had over 500 homes or mortgages that that I had to manage. So every month I was

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.820
sending out these mortgage payments and I have to put them in the in our accounting package, our software,

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:09.900
right. So I found out there was an easy way to or there was a way to import the data. But there was

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:15.660
no easy way to create that in Excel, at least not that I could find I didn't want to manually type

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:23.500
these out. So I, my first project in Python, you could say was, I figured out how to do all the loan and

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:29.640
amortization payments and the principal and interest, and make them basically batch load this entire file

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:34.820
for the month. And that's been my workflow, you know, made made paying the bills so much easier

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.720
from a daily on a daily basis.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:43.600
That's great. And there's so many examples, I'm sure that are out there like that, like even in my stuff,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.720
you know, obviously, I have to write code to run websites and things. And I've done other types of

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:55.780
programming for many years. But like, one example was, I have all of these, these videos for the courses,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.380
courses, and I had to import them. It's when I load a new course, and it doesn't sound like a big deal. But

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.100
you've got to set the time and like the duration, there's just tons of stuff. I was even thinking of

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.940
hiring somebody to like do that. And I'm like, wait a minute, I want to just write a program. And now it's

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:16.360
like, you know, a five second command line type it and boom, it's done. It's, it's just so nice when you have

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.580
those realizations, like, why am I doing this by hand? There's something surely this, this can be automated,

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.340
right? That was the impetus for me, you know, everything was doing, doing in my hand. And I,

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:32.640
and I had played around with, you know, maybe people have heard of auto hockey, you know, I'd done made

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:39.840
macros with auto hockey before years ago in windows. And so this is kind of a similar idea, like, just

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.340
automating simple tasks that you have to do anyway, but might as well just speed it up.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:49.020
Yeah, I can see somebody actually deciding, I'm going to go do that from the coffee shop,

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:55.600
taking every other Friday off as their code runs and, you know, does the work they did for half a

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.400
day. All right. So, Jim, how about you with this, this power up idea?

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.600
So it was actually really, really amazing. Some of the things that I was able to do

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:10.440
like really early on in learning Python. So a lot of the GIS workflows are really intensive and you're

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:15.020
doing a lot of steps over and over. There's been a couple of things where I've done where you might be

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:20.780
taking and doing like four things, but you do them a thousand times in a row. And without something

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:27.000
like Python, that's almost impossible to do. And my favorite example is there was a coworker who was

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.160
working on trying to do some correlations between some various data sets and his manual workflow that

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.420
he was using would take him between three and four weeks. So he was spending 120 to 160 hours,

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.040
like just manually just going through the data.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:48.820
It's like, not only is that inefficient, but that's got to be terribly ungratifying type of work.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:55.300
Oh, just terrible. Cause it was just like, click, click, click, wait five minutes, click, click,

00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:01.840
click, wait five minutes for weeks on end. And when I heard about that, I was like, all right,

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:09.140
let's fully explain what you're trying to accomplish. And I'll work something out. And a week later I had a,

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:17.320
just a little script written in Python that did his entire workflow. But instead of being able to like

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:23.500
correlate, like, like the top three correlations, I was able to correlate all of the data sets

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:29.840
and the entire script would run in eight minutes. So I replaced a month's worth of work with an eight

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.140
minute job and it only took me a week to do it.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.380
That's incredible. What was the reaction of this guy?

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:41.020
He was just completely blown away because like he went from being able to do like this type of analysis

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:46.540
12 times a year to being able to do it 12 times before lunch.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.860
Yeah. That's amazing. I've worked at companies before where there are a lot of like real scientists

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:56.820
doing scientific work. And it was this kind of thing. It was like really manual involving lots

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.780
of different sort of software pieces like Excel or other MATLAB or stuff glued together. And there's

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.540
they did the tedious little steps thinking like, this is how you do it. And it just, you have to do it

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.760
this way. And me and a couple other folks, we sort of systematically started automating like the

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.520
worst of these things like you're describing here. And every time something amazing like that came

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:22.240
out, it was like, oh, you're going to automate us out of a job. It was like, oh, yeah, this was my job.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.560
And now I don't do it anymore. What am I going to do? But of course the next week they were doing

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.540
higher level stuff or doing it more in more depth or whatever. And those people never got automated out

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.280
of a job. As far as I could tell, there's always more problems that can be solved once you free up some

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:42.840
time. This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Linode. Are you looking for bulletproof

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:43.620
this. The first one is scale. You can usually do a process a lot bigger data sets with Python or some

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:48.160
other programming language than you would normally with Excel or some other tools that you might be using.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:54.820
The other one is maintainability. You know, you can put Python scripts into proper version control like Git,

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:59.820
see what changes and when it changes. Unlike Excel, where you might have people that are working on a

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.920
common workbook and change different things and you don't know who changed what. And then also really

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.440
increasing the level of automation. Just like Jim had mentioned, I've had a few experiences, nothing

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.740
quite as dramatic, but you know, co-workers have come to me with a really manual process and asked for

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.660
help automating it. And we've been able to do that in Python and save a lot of time. That's cool. Are

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:23.220
you, are you known as like the guy that you can come with manual stuff and you can fix it? I'm trying

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:28.720
not to let that reputation spread, but yeah, a little bit. This podcast won't help, I'm sure.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:34.760
Arash, how about you? An example we have is, and I think, yeah, it's very important to kind of get

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.380
everybody to understand that, that a little bit of programming knowledge can really make you very

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:45.220
powerful. We have account managers who, similar story, were doing some manual stuff that, some

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.880
campaign data that wasn't available via an API. So they were literally going to every account and like

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:55.200
putting copy and pasting it to an Excel. And of course that made it tedious. So eventually they came to us

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.840
and I kind of, with a, with somebody helped them write a web scraper with Selenium to just basically

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:06.440
scrape that data. And so something that took her basically eight hours or a whole day, or, you know,

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.540
would just bog her down. We were able to do it like basically the same thing in five minutes, which, you know,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:17.100
they were very thankful for. And she is actually somebody who is starting to learn Python. And I think that's the

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:24.280
thing, like for people to get into using programming to make themselves super powerful, they do need somebody or

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:30.360
somebody to really kind of show them the benefits of it and kind of get them in the direction. Because I think it's,

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.240
that's not the first thing they're going to think about, because it's not natural for them. And also,

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.700
they don't really know how to get into it. So I think it really, to kind of make that happen,

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.100
you kind of do need somebody to kind of show them the way. And then hopefully that gets them excited

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.340
enough and realizes the benefits that they can start to go down that path and realize, yeah,

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.080
I could be an account manager, I could be a product manager, I could be kind of anything, but with a

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.620
little bit of programming, I could be a really powerful account manager or a powerful product manager or

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.020
whatever field you're in.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.360
I think that's a really great point about sort of seeing the light and realizing that it's not

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:09.280
all that complicated. Because to me, before I got into software development, programming computers

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:15.980
seemed really like a deep, complicated thing that took years and years and years of studying. And you

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.640
had to be the right type of person to have that kind of thinking and that just that knowledge,

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:25.240
right. And while there is some type of like, some types of software that probably is that way,

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.340
like writing a kernel for a new OS that you've invented, probably is like that. But a lot of the

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:34.440
stuff that we're talking about, and what most people need is actually not that that bad. But

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.760
you kind of have to see the light, right? You're like, wait, you did that in 15 minutes. And now

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.360
my horrible job I did for eight hours once a week is now five minutes in automatic, like,

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.420
maybe I could do that.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:48.440
Exactly. I think it's also and I try to tell everybody in our company that it's like,

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.000
you know, you don't need just because you do a little bit of programming, or you're going to

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.320
use some tool doesn't mean you're a programmer doesn't mean you're going to be an engineer.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:01.280
That's not the point of it. It's just a tool set that's going to help you do whatever is your job

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.420
better. So you don't need to think that I have to be a programmer or have to be an software engineer

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.880
to do it. It's just a tool set that you can learn just like any other tool set.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.740
Yeah, maybe you are into psychology, and you don't want to be a programmer, you want to be a

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.000
psychologist. Well, I'm sure there's awesome stuff you could automate and discover and make you a

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.920
better psychologist, right? You don't have to give that up.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.660
Exactly.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:26.960
All right. So let me ask Derek and Jim this one, because you guys are still doing the sort of

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:34.060
what you studied day to day. How has learning programming changed what you do day to day? Like,

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.660
has it changed your job? Or has it not really?

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:41.540
So I guess I'll start, I would say that it's completely changed almost everything that I do,

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:48.900
because ArcGIS, it's very good at what it is. But it's also very expensive. And so a lot of places

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:54.100
don't necessarily want to use it. And it's also quite slow. And so there's a lot of things I can do in

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:59.820
Python that are a lot faster. But one of the things that you end up missing is that like that interface

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:05.720
that ArcGIS provides. And so now I'm doing a whole lot of like, web programming and back end

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:11.580
development to like, like build up a core system. But then you still need something that like can be

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:18.920
provided to a UI so that when my teammate makes a really beautiful UI, it can consume everything that

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.060
we've processed on the back end.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.880
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think this is really great. Derek?

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:30.820
Yeah, so a lot of people that study seismology are already kind of halfway programmers, you can't

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.440
really do much in seismology without having some programming knowledge. But a lot of tools that were

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.500
common there were things like Fortran and scripting things together, stitching them together with bash,

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:46.980
that sort of thing. So I think Python has given me maybe an advantage over a lot of those

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:53.740
old workflows and that I can prototype things faster, maybe try out a new research idea much faster than

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.620
than I would have if I wasn't using Python.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:59.240
Yeah, there's probably a lot of MATLAB and those types of things going on as well there.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.180
Right. Yeah.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:08.200
Yeah. So what type of packages and tool sets do you guys use? Is it like Anaconda? Is it Django?

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.800
Derek, I'll keep going with you first, I guess.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.860
Yeah, I mostly use Anaconda. That's been a really great system for us just to avoid a lot of the

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.540
compilation, especially when we have to work on Windows systems.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:24.320
Yeah, a lot of the scientific tools can be a pain to install. So getting them pre-compiled

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.220
and just download.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.360
Yeah, very much so.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:26.420
Yeah.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.020
VC var all bad or whatever that is.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.360
Yeah, I've seen that a few times.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.840
Yeah, for sure. Jim, how about you?

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.540
So at first, when I was just learning, really the only thing I had available was the Python

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:45.520
installation that came with ArcGIS. So I had the core library and ArcPy and nothing else for

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:51.700
probably the first like two years of using Python. And then when I got Anaconda, it was fantastic

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.860
because I had all these great extra libraries that I could use. And now at this point, it's

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:02.300
a whole lot of web programming. So like right now I'm working with Sanic. We're using Postgres

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:08.000
and the Postgres extension. So because of that, we're using asyncpg to connect to Postgres. We're

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.660
Docker and Kafka and all these other things. I'm using PyKafka to communicate with Kafka.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:21.460
So it's gotten to be very, very diverse compared to where I started with Windows and ArcGIS.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:26.900
That is a serious change there. That's amazing. How do you like Sanic?

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:33.620
So for the most part, I really do like Sanic. It's very responsive. Every once in a while when I get

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:38.840
like down into a rabbit hole and there's just like not nearly as like many things on Stack Overflow of

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:44.860
like, how do I fix this problem? And I'm still wrapping my head around the whole async thing. So

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.720
it's definitely different, but I do enjoy it. It's fast.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.540
That's cool. Yeah. I've definitely wanted to do more Sanic, but I actually have a little,

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:58.880
a little bit of that feeling like, well, not necessarily that there'll be not enough answers

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:04.400
on Stack Overflow, but there's also all the other support stuff. Like here's an example of how you

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.920
do this, or here's a library you plug in that like fills this gap and things like that. So,

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.380
but it definitely looks like a cool framework.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.380
There's definitely some of that missing. And so there's been times where it's like,

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.540
I really wish I had just started this project using Flask instead of Sanic, but.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.560
But now, now you get these flask.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.720
We had very good reasons for choosing Sanic at the beginning.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.320
Yeah, absolutely. Arash, how about you?

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.160
Yeah. As far as toolset, I mean, we're mainly doing some of the typical Python web stuff. So we use

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:36.440
Flask, Frontend, we use Angular. We recently got into like Airflow, which I don't know if everyone's

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.260
familiar, but it's from Airbnb.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.600
Yeah. It's like a data pipeline thing, right?

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:45.460
Yeah. It's data pipeline. So we'd originally doing a lot of our data pipeline still is, was with

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:51.480
Pentaho. And I really hate that software. It's good at some stuff, but it's really annoying. I hate using

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.140
it. And so I started looking at Airflow and that's really nice because it's Python. We know Python,

00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:02.220
it's code. And it's just a lot easier to kind of get it up and running. That also does suffer a little

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.200
bit right now still from, I mean, it has decent documentation, but there's still a lot of stuff

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:11.600
there that it's kind of hard to find when you run into some issues. So, but it's really growing.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.840
And I think Google just brought out a product, which the underlying platform of it is using

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.260
Airflow. So I think that, you know, Airflow is probably here to stay and it's going to probably

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:25.740
grow. So, and then we're also using a Falcon framework for like an API that we've set up.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.460
So yeah, Falcon, I've had those guys on the show a while ago. It's like a really low level,

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.940
low latency API framework, right?

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:38.220
Yeah. I mean, I originally, I used to set it up maybe like two years ago when maybe I still wasn't a

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.460
little bit understanding of all the frameworks at the time, but I'm kind of glad I did actually,

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:49.540
because it was strictly for an API for our company and it is really fast and it's held up. And although

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.740
I probably would have used one of the, if I had to do it again, I'd probably use one of the other

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.680
frameworks that's built on top of Falcon, like is it Hugs or?

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.900
Yeah. Hugs is one of them.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:03.100
Yeah. Yeah. I used, we used one of those, but still it's, it's a really good fast framework for what we

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:03.400
want it.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.520
Okay. Yeah. That sounds really interesting. I haven't really talked about Airflow on the show.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:13.700
maybe give people a quick example of like what problem or what job you're accomplishing with

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.980
Airflow, like describe like why you're using it.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:21.360
Yeah. So, I mean, basically it's kind of in the real, it's not technically an ETL, which is

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.520
extract transform layer. So in a lot of companies, office software engineering, you get data,

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:30.320
but a lot of times you need to get data from one place and kind of transform it and do some

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.400
things to it and then bring it over to another place, usually to another database.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:39.180
And so that's where like an ETL comes in. And so those are usually workflows that you want to set

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:44.140
up that maybe go through many steps. And there are different like sort of softwares out there to

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:50.540
accomplish this. And Airflow is technically just like a scheduler of these flows, but it's got a nice UI

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:57.540
to it. You can kind of put tasks, you know, one after the other. It's, it uses directly acyclic graphs.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.660
So you can, and then the thing is it's code. So because the, you write Python code for those tasks,

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:07.560
you bring in a lot of programmability where a lot of the other ETL software,

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:13.120
if you ever use it, they're not like that. They kind of come with prepackaged sort of modules and

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.720
you kind of just have to use those prepackaged modules. And then it gets transported like,

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:24.660
like Pentaho is, it's really a Java XML. So it's, it's taking XML code and eventually it's,

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:30.480
you know, it's run by Java. So it's not, you know, that sounds fun. Yeah, it's, it's,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:35.900
yeah, I hate it. I love Airflow so much better. Although there, you know, there are differences

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:40.460
and there are some things that, that sort of like Pentaho is better than an Airflow. I mean,

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:45.180
right now, just to give a use case, which also brings in async is that one thing we're using

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:49.840
Airflow mainly for right now is that we're, we're, some of our stuff is done in some other

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:55.180
software, some email platforms. And so we need a lot of their data through their API. So

00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:00.980
instead of at real time getting that data API, we're like making tasks where we, where we hit

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:06.060
those APIs, get all that data, transform it the way we want, and then, and then put it in our database.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.820
So then when we run our application, we don't need to rely on the API anymore. We just pull it from the

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:17.880
database. And we actually ended up using asyncio and IO HTTP to, to speed up those tasks, which came

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.860
really in handy and was, a great example of using async at that point because we make,

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:28.000
we're making thousands of API requests. And so instead of like a task original, we were running

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.160
was taking two and a half hours. We got it down to like 10 or 15 minutes.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:36.340
That's really awesome. Yeah. Some of that IO HTTP stuff, the client side stuff is really powerful.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.200
Yeah. So we're basically pulling all this stuff, pre-fetching all this stuff from APIs,

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.980
from our different, softwares that we work with and then, transforming it into the

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.960
forms that we need and dumping it in our database. So then that way we don't have to rely on them when

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.080
we actually run our application.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.260
It sounds like a real cool use of airflow. Nice.

Rob, how about you? Tool set.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.900
Sounds like I need to learn airflow, but

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.520
I, yeah, I'm primarily use

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:03.400
Anaconda and all the associated or many of the associated

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.560
packages that come with it. So pandas I'm using every day

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:12.840
and I love Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab now. I have transitioned over to that. That's

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:17.880
mainly what I'm using at work. And then on a personal level, I, you know, still, of course,

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.480
love requests and beautiful soup, but that's my personal project.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.460
The whole web is your API. It's sweet.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.260
Yes, exactly.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.720
So you switched from Jupyter to JupyterLab. Why was that?

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.740
That's kind of where Jupyter is headed from everything I've read. They're going to eventually,

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:45.140
I think they're going to sunset Jupyter Notebooks and it's going to move exclusively to JupyterLab. I don't know the timeline. It's probably a few years off still, but they had released the beta.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:35:00.160
I believe it was December or January. I can't remember for sure, but I jumped on board right away and it works. I haven't had any trouble. There's a few features that are missing from JupyterLab still compared to Jupyter Notebooks.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:11.220
But the nice thing is if you have the latest version of Jupyter installed, you can run as long as the Jupyter server is running, you can run both. It doesn't care.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.640
It's just a UI front to the server.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:26.780
Yeah, it's just a different UI than the Jupyter Notebooks. I mean, it'll look familiar, but then there's like the file browsers is built in right there. And so is the command palette. So it's all, it's just all built in right there.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:39.320
And then you can, the nicest thing about it is you can have, you know, multiple tabs so you can compare notebooks side by side. You can actually copy cells or drag cells from one notebook to the other.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.080
Oh, wow.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:50.240
So, you know, I'm, yeah. So anytime I, which is really nice for reproducibility, because, you know, sometimes I might get a request at work like, hey, can you, you know, run this report, but change this.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:36:06.560
I actually had that happen this morning where it's basically just, you know, I had to drop in like a lot of the same code, but then make a few small changes. So you just literally, I just copy or three or four of the cells and drag them to the new notebook and run it again.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.440
It's cool. It's a little bit like, like an IDE version of Jupyter, right?

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.980
Yeah, that's actually a really good description for it. Yeah.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:17.720
Yeah. We started using that a little bit. Our style, we were, we were also using Pandas and JupyterNova.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:30.160
We started using JupyterLab and actually talk about empowering. This is another example. We had one of our colleagues who's working on this app and he would get requests of these files that they would send him that are like over a million.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.900
And so Excel actually has real trouble when you get to really large files and he had to segment them.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.340
So it would crash constantly. So he kept sending it to me and be like, hey, can you take care of this?

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:43.060
So finally I was like, you know what? I'm going to teach you Jupyter. It's not that hard.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:54.300
And I did teach him. And once every week he comes to me and says, Arash, thank you so much for teaching me this. Now I can just take care of this stuff and I feel more empowered.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:37:02.480
So that's another example of that empowerment. And then, and JupyterLab notebook, whichever one you use, like really makes that really easy actually.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:11.800
I wonder if Jupyter for those types of folks almost is like a Trojan horse for teaching them programming. Like, look, you're not a programmer. You're not writing source code.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:22.980
You've got this thing and it does like computation and you type in it. You know what I mean? Like, of course it's still Python and stuff, but like, I wonder if it's perceived differently by people who, who come at it from that perspective fresh.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:30.700
Yeah, I think it could because the interface is not, you know, because I guess there's some web versions of it, or if you run it locally, you got that kind of web looking interface.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:39.700
So it doesn't, you know, you don't have to pull up a dedicated editor that you have to install and things like that. So yeah, I think it probably is a good, you know, and it deals with data.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:52.200
And most people in some area have to deal with manipulating data. And once in Excel, yeah, you can start getting large files or having to do any kind of manipulation of sorting or any kind of complex thing in Excel.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:59.460
And it starts taking like two minutes to do that. And you're sitting there with the spinner and you're like, okay, I got to find something, something else.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.640
It's got to be a better way.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:10.080
I think on the flip side too, though, I mean, a lot of people can use Jupyter as kind of a crutch and build some really big systems that really should be put into proper packages and things.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:18.400
So it's kind of hard to know once you've made the transition from exploratory data analysis into something that should be, you know, more software engineered.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.500
That's a really good point.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.820
I'm probably guilty of that myself.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:30.260
There's probably cases where I should just be putting them into a script and not running it in the Jupyter notebook itself.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.880
It's hard to know, though. It just sort of creeps up on you.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.600
Yeah, definitely.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.920
Yeah, that's really interesting that you could take it too far, right?

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.900
Like eventually you might want to break out of it.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:44.840
To me, doing traditionally like web development and database stuff and so on, that's usually across lots of files.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:50.420
And it's like a different way of programming than people do with exploratory data.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.600
And it took me for a little while to get my head around like what is the real value?

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.940
Like why do people love Jupyter and these notebooks so much?

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:05.820
But when I saw people really doing the exploratory data stuff with them, oh, this really is pretty amazing for that type of work.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:06.360
I agree.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.680
I didn't get Jupyter.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.320
I kept hearing people talking about it.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:15.120
And it was really only about probably about a year and a half ago that I saw someone demonstrate it.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.160
And then it clicked.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.660
I'm like, oh, that makes a lot of sense now.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.400
And it really has changed, you know, the way I can do a data analysis.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.140
I hardly ever open Excel anymore.

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.600
I kind of hate it now.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.940
Yeah, you've got to be pretty good with pandas for that.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:29.540
But that's awesome.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.500
Yeah, yeah.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.000
That's, I mean, for sure.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.800
I mean, panda, but I'll echo, you know, you get with large files.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:46.960
You know, Excel just kind of starts crashing if you're trying to do a lot of, especially if you throw, you know, multiple view lookups in, you know, or literally a large data set.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:52.760
But pandas, unless you're dealing with gigabytes of data, it is really, really fast.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.800
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.720
All right.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:01.720
So I want to sort of do a little bit of forward looking stuff with you guys here, maybe by starting looking backwards.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:10.040
So I guess if you have people who are coming into your industry and they don't have any programming background, what advice would you give them?

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.080
Let's start with you, Derek.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:11.520
Okay.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:19.080
Well, I think the first one, a lot of people that I've told about programming coming from my background have said things like, well, I haven't had a class in that.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.380
Or I don't know about that because no one is, I just don't have any experience with it.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:32.220
And so I think getting over this mental block that you have to have taken a university or a high school course on something in order to learn it is a real barrier for some people.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:37.340
So the first one would be just understand that you don't have to be taught everything formally.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:42.880
And the second one would be to be a little bit humble and try to be comfortable being uncomfortable.

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:52.540
And what I mean by that is when you try something new, especially when there's other people around you that are really good at it, you're kind of putting yourself in a position of inferiority, right?

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.800
It can be kind of intimidating.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.660
Maybe it's not the best feeling.

00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:04.540
But if you can really just kind of take it step by step and learn what you can in those situations, I think you can really grow professionally and as a person as well.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:16.040
Yeah, that's great advice, especially in today's age, you know, like if you could either take a semester long course and disrupt your life Monday, Wednesday, Friday for two hours plus homework and exams.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:25.980
Or you could take a weekend and an online course and get pretty close, honestly, you know, even free stuff on YouTube, you may be able to sort of teach yourself.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.980
So it's definitely a different perspective.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.800
I think that people probably got to write their minds around.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.560
Yeah, cool.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.980
I think, too, if you have a specific problem that you're trying to solve, that really is a good way to learn.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:44.620
You just learn enough to solve a problem and then you get a harder problem and you kind of build your knowledge of programming as you solve the problems you have to address anyway.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.440
Yeah, because you can't learn it all at once.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.620
It just becomes overwhelming.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.180
All right.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.680
So if you can focus it, like I need to do these three things.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.120
How do I do those three things?

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.540
And it becomes way easier.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:58.120
I'll echo that, you know, the statement about solving a specific problem because that was my advice, too.

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:03.840
I set out to learn programming just because and but I didn't I didn't have a problem to solve at first.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.560
But then once I did and I didn't really make a lot of progress until I did have a problem to solve.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:13.100
You know, once I was doing that accounting job and said, oh, I can automate this step.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:18.160
And that's where I made progress because I was figuring out how to do a specific task.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.920
And then I'm just like he said, you move on from there and solve bigger problems and take it step by step.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.480
Don't feel like you have to learn everything all at once because you're you're not going to.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.740
And it takes time to for things to come automatically.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.860
I mean, there's things that I do now in Python that, you know, just come naturally.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:41.220
But a year or two years ago, I would have had to look it up on Stack Overflow again, you know, for the hundredth time.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:47.500
It's hard to realize that things like that will become automatic and you sort of go on autopilot like driving a car.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:51.940
It's like there's so many inputs and things and stuff you got to juggle.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:56.580
But eventually most of it becomes sort of just stuff you do automatically.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.620
Yeah, even Pandas.

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.420
I mean, I've only been using Pandas for just over a year.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:06.260
But because I've been using it every day for about almost a year, it is natural now, you know.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.400
And and I know, you know, the documentation is there.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:13.800
I know how to figure out how to do something, even if I don't know how to do it off the top of my head.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.680
Yeah, that's excellent.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.560
Jim, what's your advice?

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:24.960
So I would say for anyone who's working with ArcGIS, I would start by just looking at what your daily workflow is, whatever you're doing day to day.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:31.960
Go look at Arc's help docs because they've got for every function that you can use.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.040
They've got a Python example of how you do it with Python.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.300
And it's not just like the one line of how to use the function.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:43.300
It's like a short little script of beginning to end how you would use this.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:49.320
And then look at your workflow, start grabbing all those like pieces of scripts, customize it to whatever you need.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:54.620
And then all of a sudden you've replaced an entire workflow with a Python script that's your own work.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.900
And after you've done that, learn a little bit more about just like generic Python.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:15.840
And then even though this isn't necessarily Python related, I would highly recommend learning PostGIS and SQL because there's a lot of things that you can do in PostGIS that just aren't readily easy to do in ArcGIS.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.340
Right.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.000
Have a little bit of database knowledge, possibly.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.040
Yeah, great.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:20.460
Arush?

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:25.860
I actually probably have a lot to say on this topic, but I'll try to keep it to some main points.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:26.960
I think it's a combination.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.760
I think one of the two main points is a combination of learning and doing.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:37.000
And I think you've got to balance it in the sense that some people might realize you don't do anything on titles.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.560
And some people might just rush in and just do stuff but not really even pick up a book and learn some fundamentals.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.520
I think you've got to kind of do both.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.720
You've got to pick up the book and learn the fundamentals.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:52.080
But most of the time you won't truly understand all of it until you actually start doing some stuff.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.920
So you've got to kind of do that back and forth.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.080
And a lot of times, decide to build the application for Flask while you're reading your Python book.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.500
And then after you finish the Flask, you probably want to go back and read that Python.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:07.600
Because then a lot of the things in there will start to click better for you after you've had the experience.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.060
And so you've got to kind of go back and forth.

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.140
Almost an iterative learning style, right?

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:12.700
Yeah.

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:16.720
It's like, yeah, because I know a lot of times the stuff I read, I thought I understood it.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.520
Or maybe you think you understand it, but you don't really understand it.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.440
So you actually are somewhere stuck and you're trying to do something.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.760
You're like, oh.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.400
Then you refer to it.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.080
And then you're like, oh, now I understand what they were talking about in that book.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:32.480
And so going back and rereading some of the stuff that you're trying to.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.100
So try to learn the fundamentals.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.140
But don't let that from stop you trying to build stuff.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.260
Because as I said, as everyone said here, especially if you have a specific problem.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.280
Or just decide on some project.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.640
And just start working on it.

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.720
And then try to read and work sort of concurrently as best as you can.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:53.880
And I think that will set you on a good path to try to learn.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.700
Yeah, that's great.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:59.880
So the last one, I guess, is think about the industry that you came from originally.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:04.580
Where do you see programming and things like artificial intelligence?

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.540
And just people having these programming skills increasingly over time.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:13.820
Pushing the industry and changing the way that people do their jobs there.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.140
Derek, let's just start with you.

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:15.420
Okay.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.540
I've seen a lot of hype around artificial intelligence and machine learning.

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:23.600
And there's some bigger companies that are doing some things that are pretty significant with it.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:27.180
But I think there has to be a lot of footwork on the ground level.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:39.240
Maybe the average engineer is going to have to gain some more data literacy before you can get data into a format or a sensible database in order to be able to do these bigger analyses on them that really can add value.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:48.040
And so I see a lot of emphasis on data literacy, maybe simple scripting becoming part of the curriculum for a lot of engineering disciplines.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.660
And then I'd also like to see a lot more open source being used.

00:46:51.660 --> 00:47:04.620
A lot of companies will pay a lot of money for, I would even say, subpar proprietary packages that a lot of open source libraries can do for free if you just knew that they existed and knew how to install them.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.080
Yeah, that's a really good point about the open source stuff.

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.640
And I think open source is definitely going to drive a lot of change for a lot of areas.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.080
Jim?

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:18.820
In the GIS realm, one of the things that we have always had to deal with is the fact that we almost always have more data than we can actually handle.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:23.240
Because the whole world is our subject.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:31.260
And so a lot of times we'll scale our data back to a lower resolution so that we can just even begin to do the processing.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:38.720
So as new things come out that lets us work with bigger and bigger data sets, we already have those data sets available.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:49.740
We've got petabytes of satellite imagery that just, for the most part, goes relatively unprocessed just because there's nothing that can process that much data all that easily.

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.200
Yeah.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:56.920
And as the processing power gets better and people are more capable to take advantage of it, you know, larger problems will be solved, right?

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.200
Yep.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:57.480
Yeah.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:57.960
Very cool.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:58.680
Arash?

00:47:58.820 --> 00:47:59.000
Yeah.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.380
Actually, you know, even though I'm not in organic chemistry anymore, I still read a few articles here and there about what's going on.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:19.660
And actually one that I saw, which I was not surprised that things were in this direction, was that MIT, someone at a group at MIT, I come up with an artificial intelligence that was significantly better at predicting medicinal chemistry compounds for clinical trial type of stuff.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:27.980
So basically, you know, medicinal chemists, if people don't know chemistry, are the people who sort of investigate the type of compounds that eventually will become drugs.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:43.680
And that's a very slow, costly process of iteratively making compounds, thousands of compounds to even see, whereas eventually there is definitely a solution here for software to really step in and make that process faster and cheaper.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:50.840
And this MIT team came up with this article about it being vastly improved as far as predicting better compounds.

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:53.560
And I see that's really where the direction is going.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:57.440
And there's already lots of robotic automation happening in organic chemistry.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.160
When I was there, I'm sure that's expanded.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:15.420
So along with artificial intelligence, you kind of see where now computers can fairly accurately design drugs for diseases and push it through the pipeline, which, you know, hopefully should reduce, we would hope to reduce the cost of drugs and be able to discover drugs faster.

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.580
I mean, that's ultimately the goal.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.680
Right now, the process takes anywhere from 10 to 20 years.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.660
I mean, if we could discover a drug for disease in two years, that would be a lot better.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.280
Yeah, that would be great.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.620
Maybe, maybe even lower the price of.

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.140
Maybe.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.400
Probably not.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.740
Just raise the profits, probably.

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:44.280
But one thing I'm really surprised about is how much programming and automation are affecting medicine, actually, because that seems like a really human hands-on sort of thing.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:56.760
But we've got, you know, AI doing the job of radiologists in cancer detection for Google did a thing on studying readmissions and, like, finding out that people are going to have to come back to the hospital sooner.

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.480
I believe this example.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:05.540
Like, it's really interesting how these sort of good doctor medical jobs are almost under threat from software.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:16.700
Yeah, I think it's a case where a lot of this feels like, if you're talking about medicinal chemists, I mean, the lore was you had the old medicinal chemist guy who, you know, had been making compounds for, you know, 20 years.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.580
And he just knew which one was going to be the right compound, right?

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:25.520
So that had been basically an operation for a very long time just because there really wasn't an alternative.

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:34.620
There wasn't the data, be able to crunch data, analyze it, and do the type of things predictably that we do now that we are starting to be able to do now just wasn't available.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:42.300
So you kind of had to rely on this sort of people who had just experience in the field and just sort of their experience guiding it.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.680
But now I think we have more data.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.880
We can analyze it.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:46.980
We can predict it.

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:57.700
And that's going to start to replace those, unfortunately, in some level, replace those old guys with the feel of, yeah, I know this is going to be the right thing or that's going to be, you know, the right way to do it.

00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:59.980
And it's like, no, the data is going to drive us now.

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.380
That's really interesting.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.680
Rob, how about you?

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:20.660
Yes, I'm not sure from an accounting standpoint, since I'm not in the industry anymore, but I would imagine there are companies already working on, you know, the AI machine learning side of things to automate the more manual sides of doing accounting and bookkeeping and things like that.

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.380
And probably tax wise, too, I would imagine.

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:31.300
I think it's what H&R Block already advertises how they use IBM Watson for calculating your taxes or something like that.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:31.860
Oh, interesting.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.180
Yeah.

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:45.520
So I'm sure, you know, down the road, there's going to be a point where, you know, you click two buttons and all your tax data is imported and your return is filed automatically without having to do much of anything.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.480
But we're probably still a little ways on.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:47.940
Yeah.

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:54.580
So kind of folks can become almost like advisors more than like computers, I guess.

00:51:54.760 --> 00:52:00.280
Yeah, I think it kind of goes back to what some of the other guys talked about where, you know, oh, you're going to take away my job.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.460
Well, no, not really.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:09.820
You're just going to work on higher level, you know, planning type of things versus the actual manual work of calculating taxes or doing keeping.

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:10.200
Yeah.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.240
And that sounds like a good thing.

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.820
Yeah, probably.

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:14.700
All right.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:15.880
So I think we have to leave it there.

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.280
We're pretty much out of time, everyone.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.380
But I wouldn't be Talk Python without the final two questions.

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:22.860
So just quickly, I'll go down the list.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:23.900
You guys can let me know.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.580
So Derek, favorite editor and notable PyPI package?

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.160
I don't really have a favorite editor.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.360
I'll use Vim or Spyder or PyCharm just depending on what I'm doing.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:42.700
Notable package, I found this package called Sorted Containers, which basically I had run into some software that had used this custom AVL implementation.

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:47.000
And I was able to basically get rid of a lot of the compiled C code using this package.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.360
So check that out if you're in the need of something like that.

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.060
Oh, that's sweet.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:50.440
Jim?

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.080
So I spend most of my time using PyCharm if I can.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:53:04.760
And my notable package would be Huppr, which is a great development package where if you've got like a web server running and anytime you make a change to your code, you want it to automatically restart.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.680
Huppr takes care of that for you.

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:12.440
Yeah, that's really cool because normally you've got to like restart the process for it to redetect and reload the Python modules.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.140
But I think Flask does this automatically.

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:15.880
All right.

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:21.680
You can say like --debug or reload or something and it'll watch those changes.

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.300
And maybe it's even using Huppr inside.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:23.960
That's cool.

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.200
Definitely a nice feature.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:25.740
Arash?

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:29.620
I used to be a PyCharm person, but I have switched to VS Code.

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:33.660
I'm really loving VS Code, so I think I'm pretty set on sticking with it.

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.720
And then for a package, I'll reroute it Airflow.

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.440
I think it's still fairly new.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.220
I don't know how many people are using it, but if you have data pipeline workflows,

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:48.120
I need to do some data processing and you want to do some scheduling, check out Airflow.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:52.580
It's a really good package and it can solve a lot of those kind of problems.

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:52.980
Nice.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.560
It sounds like you guys are doing cool stuff with it.

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:54.880
Yeah.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.180
Rob?

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:56.120
Favorite editor.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:03.280
I'm doing, I mean, a lot of my work is, you know, Jupyter now, but if I'm doing just stuff locally,

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.760
it's sublime generally or occasionally then.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:07.400
Okay, great.

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:07.800
And package?

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.140
Yeah, package a little one called PiperClip, which is really simple.

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:17.840
It can, you just give it a path or anything and it will copy something to your clipboard,

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:24.700
which is really handy when people send you files that you have to load into Pandas and the name is never consistent.

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:31.520
So we literally just copy the file name and have the path set up and you concatenate together.

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.240
It's all set to go.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.420
Oh, that's cool.

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:35.720
I really like PiperClip.

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.000
I use it for some automation as well.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.840
And just like the results will pop out and I don't want to save them to a file, but I just,

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.200
I need to paste them somewhere else.

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.440
And so the last bit in that step is just copy to clipboard.

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.380
And, you know, if I want it, it's there.

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.080
If not, like, you know, I just ignore what's in my clipboard.

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:56.860
Yeah, I just, I usually just use it to grab something and put it in my clipboard and grab it from there without having to paste it.

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:57.100
So.

00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:57.720
Yeah, great.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:58.220
Very nice.

00:54:58.220 --> 00:54:58.660
Yep.

00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.100
Very nice.

00:54:59.100 --> 00:54:59.740
Good recommendation.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:01.120
All right, everyone.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.700
Thank you for being on the show.

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:06.620

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:06.960
Thanks.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.100
Thanks.

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.440
Thank you.

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:08.700
Thanks.

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:09.060
You bet.
