00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:06.340
Hey everyone, Michael here. It's just about time to close out 2016, isn't it? Well, I have a few

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.660
comments and a bonus episode for you. So first of all, thank you so much for listening to Talk

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.940
Python, helping make it a success. It really means a lot to me and I love all the listeners. I love

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.360
the community around it and just want to say thanks for taking the time and subscribing and

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.840
listening. I've had so much fun that I decided to start a second podcast. You may have heard of it.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.680
It's called Python Bytes and I launched this podcast with Brian Okken. The whole idea behind

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.200
it is that we're going to bring Python headlines and news and kind of just new cool items to your

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.000
earbuds, right? So every week we'll try to cover some timely news and maybe just something cool that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.100
we found. It's much shorter. It's not really an interview format or long form format as I think

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.080
of Talk Python. So I've decided to post this single episode of Python Bytes to the Talk Python listeners

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.780
so everyone gets a chance to check it out. I know many of you have extra time around New Year's.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.400
So here's one more episode for you to listen to while you're driving to and from relative's house.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.860
If you like what you hear, just visit pythonbytes.fm and subscribe to get episodes like this weekly.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.860
So I want to wish you all a happy holiday season and happy New Year. And I'll be back on Talk

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.360
Python in a few days with Software Carpentry and the Sciences with Jonah from software-carpentry.org.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.680
Until then, enjoy this episode with Brian and myself and have a great break.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.180
This is Python Bytes. Python headlines and news delivered directly to your earbuds. It's episode 6,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.100
recorded Monday, December 12th. This episode is brought to you by Rollbar. They help take the pain

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.240
out of errors. Thank you so much, Rollbar, for sponsoring the show. And this is Michael Kennedy,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.760
one of your hosts. I'm here with Brian Okken, my co-host. Hello, Brian. How's it going, man?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.440
Hello. It's going really good.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.880
Good, good. This year's gone by quickly, hasn't it?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.800
It's gone. It's super fast.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.360
Yeah. I feel like everyone was fixated on the election because it was so unique. And then

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.000
kind of nobody knows what to do with the rest of the year. So I'm going to go on vacation. How about

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.160
you?

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.040
I'm going to start writing. So yeah, you got a book to finish, man. Anyway, so the point is,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.320
this is actually our last episode of the year. So I want to say thanks to everybody who subscribed and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.280
listened and shared this podcast with their friends. We're taking a break and we will be back first

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.760
thing in January, first week. We'll have even more news to share, won't we?

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.000
Yeah. That'll be, I have like three weeks of stuff to catch up on.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.100
Yeah. Hopefully no drama. Okay. So what's the first item you want to share with everyone? What

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.400
do you find?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.280
Well, there's an article by Dan Bader, make your Python code more readable with custom exception

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.360
classes. This is great. He wrote up a little tutorial along with a five minute video where he

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.900
walks through stuff. He talks about the, including your own exception classes can make your errors

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.820
more readable within your code and also communicate to the users of your functions or whatever your

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.560
intent and what the errors are. And also you can add more context. I like it because it's one of

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.740
those things that I was afraid to add custom exceptions and it's really just pretty darn easy.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.220
The main points I think is to remember to derive from either exception or one of the other built-in

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.280
Python exceptions.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.160
Like value error or something like that, right?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:25.060
Yeah. Whatever sort of makes sense. And, and it's a, it's a good one. I also wanted to add that if you

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.480
are, there's extra things you should do if you're releasing a package and, or even within, within your

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.000
company, I think it's good to derive from your own, create a custom exception and then derive all your

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.380
other exceptions from that one. And I got that tip from another article that we'll link to in the show

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.180
notes by Julian Danju.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a really great point actually, because it would be great to do try

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.720
except all of the errors from this package. Like whatever's happening in here, I want to start by

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.100
handling those and maybe get more specific ones. Maybe not, but yeah, I hadn't really thought about

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.780
that. The make your own special base exception.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.940
even the reverse try to do specific first and then, and then do a catch all of those. And then

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.360
if it isn't one of your package ones, then you can also still catch the general exception and do

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.200
something different there.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.420
Yeah. That's cool. There's two, there's a couple of things about this article. I like

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.100
when Dan Bader is doing a bunch of cool videos on YouTube, he really seems to be putting a lot of

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.720
effort to frequently get those out. And so here's an article that takes like five minutes to read,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.180
but there's also a five minute video screencast to go along with it. So well done on that, Dan.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.620
And then more generally, this idea here, it makes it easier for one of my favorite programming

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.960
patterns, which is also quite Pythonic is in that it's the pattern is it's easier to ask for

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.520
forgiveness than permission, as opposed to like the C++ style. Look before you leap programming

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.620
model where you test the heck out of everything that you try thing. You just here, you just do it.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.540
If there was an exception, you know, you catch it and then accept block and it's all good.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.560
Yeah. I definitely like a, at a high level, like for instance, if I were, as an example,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.680
if I were using requests, I could have a special handler that dealt with exceptions from requests

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.800
and know that, that I, cause I understand what part of my system's dealing with that. I could

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.720
handle it in one place. right. Absolutely. Yeah. Could not contact server. The web service

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.920
seems to be down something like this, right? Beautiful. Wouldn't it be awesome if like artificial

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:33.140
intelligence could just like sit there and just like help you code? I mean, we all know of AI for

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.440
like Siri and silly things like that, but I feel like actually 2016 is a little bit where the future

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.500
kind of intersected with now it like things became the future came to us. There are so many things

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.720
with AI that are really awesome. Like there was several AIs that actually on their own invented

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.520
encryption. But what I want is an AI to help me as a developer. How about you? Sounds great. Yeah.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.460
That'd be super cool. So, so I actually ran across this thing. one of the listeners,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.380
Gilberto Diaz was nice enough to send me a link and, an email and say, Hey, there's this thing

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.080
that is so cool. You must check it out. It's not technically built in Python, but it really supports

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.620
Python developers in a crazy good way. So there's this thing called kite at kite.com and it's in

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.180
private beta. We were lucky enough to get some early access to it. And what it is, is like you install

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.280
it in your OS and it sits in kind of like a sidebar and it takes up maybe like, I don't know, a fifth of

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.520
your screen. If you have two screens and you know, stick it on the other one and it watches what you do

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.900
in all sorts of different programming environments in sublime text and Visual Studio Code in pycharm,

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:45.220
even Vim or Emacs has many, many plugins. As you type, it helps you. All right. So, if you're

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.020
writing Python code and you type import space, it'll show you a list of the most popular packages. If you

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.660
type R, it'll show you the list of the most popular packages that start with R like request right at the

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.400
top. Yeah. And then once you import a thing, it'll start showing you documentation about it. Here's

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.480
some examples on how to use that thing you just imported. As you start to like, you know, interact

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.440
with it, like request dot, it'll say, well, the most commonly called function here is get, you want to

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.180
see some examples, how to use request dot get or like the documentation. And it just, it just really

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:21.540
is quite cool how much it knows. And you know, it does auto completion. Like many editors do it'll,

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.080
it'll like show you on the left, like, here's the things you can complete. But what I like about it is

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:32.180
it uses like crowdsourcing for popularity. So there's like, you know, 10,000, developers

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.140
working on this and they'll say, well, this is the most popular completion in this situation here.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.560
Base, not just alphabetical or something. So I think it's cool. There's, there's a great video.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.880
You have to watch if you go check this out at kite.com. It's like right there in the homepage.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.980
I'm, I'm looking forward to playing with it. Yeah. You, you'd mentioned it seems like AI pair

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.880
programming and, does sure sound like that. It's, it's quite interesting. I feel like it's

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.220
more like an artificial intelligence mentor rather than paired programmer. Like it's going,

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.760
Oh, by the way, did you know that the, you actually can call this function? Oh,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.140
that package is really cool. Cause it has this thing you might not know about. It's kind of like

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:12.180
the wiser, wiser version rather than like, you know, pair programmer, but I think it's great.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.660
Oh, definitely looking forward to trying that. Yeah, for sure.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:20.740
I hate it when my data gets messy. Yeah, definitely. so there, there's an article,

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:28.080
uh, by, I'm going to even try this John Nicholas hold, I think tidy data in Python. This article

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.300
was pretty interesting. It caught my attention because I often have data that's in a format that

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:39.060
I can't use right away and I need to transform it into something else. And I didn't ever think of it

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:44.520
like, changing tables around and, and completely changing things automatically. Anyway,

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:50.300
this article gives some, some attributes of what problems to look at and data sets. He based it on

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:59.300
a paper named tidy data by Hadley Wickham. He takes the idea of the paper and then transfers it to,

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:06.460
into Python and how to, how to utilize it in Python with the pandas library. And like, so this seems

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:12.900
very abstract right now, but he has some examples of, data that's, that's really data is in the,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:19.260
the column headers. He has some attributes to look for, like each variable forms a column and contains a

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:28.180
value and each observation forms a row and the type of observation units form a table. And it still sounds

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:34.320
kind of complex or kind of abstract, but the examples really are pretty easy to follow. And I, it's just a,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.860
a neat idea of, of taking a look at your data and making it more useful.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:44.660
I had never really thought about data in this sense, but it seems to me like this talks about how you put

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.800
your data together so that you'll be, it's most natural to take advantage of it with things like

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:56.380
pandas and the various, data science tools and all sorts of languages, but he's focused on Python,

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.780
which is extra cool. And so he's, he has several examples on, on, you know, do things this way,

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.760
not that way. And your life will be much easier. And I just never thought of systemizing that, I guess.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.360
Yeah. And also, looking at the different comparison of before and after tables, you can

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:19.300
definitely see how it's definitely the, the converted table is easier programmatically, but the from table,

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:26.160
the, the dirty one is, it's, it's more broken up, like how people look at stuff. I,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.820
I didn't think there would be a difference, but it does appear to be it's, it's easier for,

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:36.480
to visualize smaller tables as people, but, as computers, we need things a little bit more

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.060
broken down.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.760
Yeah, it's cool. So if you've got a lot of data, especially in tabular form, check that out.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:46.560
We're going on break. Like I'm actually heading out on vacation somewhere away from home and,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.840
you know, I'm still taking my laptop with me because that would be kind of insane, but you know,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.480
our sponsor roll bar, they, they were going to let me just chill out and not worry about

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.660
whether the web app is working and not check it all the time. Like I might not use my computer for

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:05.500
a few days unless I get notifications on my phone or, you know, text messages or Slack or something

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.280
like that saying, Hey, your website's down. There's this problem. You know, things are going to be good.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.600
I'm not going to worry about it. That's because I got roll bar integrated with all the talk Python

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.840
stuff, which is really cool. So if there's a problem, you know, I can just read what the error

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.860
is and probably fix it pretty easily. So all the Python byte listeners, they can have the same

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.820
peace of mind. They just have to go to rollbar.com slash Python bytes and sign up for the free tier.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.580
Sounds cool, huh?

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.560
Sounds very good.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.580
Yeah. Yeah. It's good. It's good to be on vacation and you'll not worry about things working. Just

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:37.800
set up the error notifications and you're all good. I'm really excited that there's a new version of

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.680
Python. I'm, I think people are starting to move on from legacy Python and there's just end of this

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.780
week. There's going to be one more reason to do so. So we actually have as our next item, a video,

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:55.560
a conference presentation at PyCon Canada, 2016 by Brett Cannon. He did a talk called what's new in

00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:01.180
Python three. And I think it's interesting. You look at all the peps and all the stuff that's coming

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.840
and you think, well, okay, they're doing little tweaks here. I guess it has new string formatting,

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:11.660
whatever. It turns out there are over 16 peps in Python three six. And that's more than any peps

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.860
that have been in Python three other than the actual creation of Python 3.0 itself. That's pretty cool,

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:17.060
right?

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:22.960
Maybe we should have had another role before now then maybe, but I'm excited for all of these.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.960
Yeah. It's going to be great. It's going to be great. The reason I like this video and I want to

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.980
point it out is we could all go to, you know, what's new in Python three and we can read the list.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:37.640
Like, okay, well here dictionaries will be ordered. there's now a private identifier or like a

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.480
versioning number on dictionaries. Like, okay, whatever, who cares? This gives you the story

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.120
behind all the changes coming to Python three six, right? Why did the core developers of which Brett

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.680
is one think that this is a good idea? Like, how does it help? What, what really problem,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.600
what problem are they really trying to solve deep down when they made this change? And it really is

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.140
a cool look inside what's coming with Python three six. that sounds great.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:07.020
I think it's, it's good. So Python three six release candidates available right now if you want to

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.800
download it, but you know, if you can wait like five days, you should have the final version of Python

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.000
three six. They did something with virtual environments, right?

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.980
Yeah. This is one of the things I, I was stumbled across. I think it was in a Reddit line somewhere.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:26.900
The command command line command of pyvenv, which I can't remember which version that came in on one

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:32.840
of the three O's that's being deprecated. And the reason, and they want people to use the dash

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:40.900
M V E N V instead. And that's so that you specifically tell the virtual environment system,

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:47.500
which Python to use. And it makes the programmer know, need to know how to get to Python first before

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.160
they create a virtual environment. I think that it totally makes sense. It's just something to point

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.040
out. I think it's important. It, I'm going to have to actually edit my book because of this,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.820
because, I think I, I recommended pyvenv in mine. So time to un-recommend it.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.360
Yeah. That's cool. No, I do think it is good. I mean,

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.720
you can say Python three --version. You'll see what that is. And then you can say

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.840
Python three dash M V and V, and then that's the thing you're going to get. Right. So it is a little

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:20.240
more clear, I guess. Very cool. Yeah. It wouldn't be a week in Python without some form of testing or

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.380
code coverage, right? Yeah, definitely. And, Ned Batchelder, who we all owe some gratitude for,

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:32.800
for coming up with, or for taking over the coverage package. He's, I interviewed him,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.520
about that on episode 12 of testing code, but, he's planning a new feature for coverage up high,

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:45.360
um, which will tell us which, so when you, when you run a coverage report, also what functions

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:51.800
caused this or how did you get this stuff covered? And, he covers it in an article. He taught,

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:58.240
he titled, who tests what this is a discussion about kind of, how I like the discussion because

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.840
those, those, those people new to coverage can kind of peek inside and see the different stages

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.700
of how coverage works. It goes through measurement and storing the data and then combining the data

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:14.500
and reporting because you can't have multiple tests, most multiple runs and combine them into,

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:20.260
to one report. This idea of, trying to figure out which code was covered by which tests

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:25.980
is how it started, but he comes up with some, some reasons why there may be more,

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:32.440
more uses than just in testing. And it's a, it's a good discussion, but part of one of the things he,

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.840
why he wrote this article is, is to try to get some help. He wants some feedback.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.660
So some of the questions are, he discusses the memory, memory usage and, and the data model.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:48.060
And he wants to know if there's something we need more sophisticated problem solving on this,

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:53.960
or should we be more conservative with memory? And then the output, the output right now is intended

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.040
to be in Jason, but he wants to know if somebody could use a different data format. I like the

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.320
direction he's going with it. And I think I'll use it. And I encourage anybody that has sort of a

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.200
non-standard usage of coverage to take a look at this article and give Ned some feedback.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.600
Yeah. I really like it as well, because a lot of times, unless you're actually a contributor to the

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.260
project already, you feel like the fate of the thing has already determined, but this was much more like,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.480
look, we have this challenging problem. these are the ways and the trade-offs were

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.980
thinking about the ways we're thinking about solving it. The trade-offs were contemplating.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.140
We're not sure where to go. If you want to help, here's how to help. If you want to give us feedback

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:36.920
before we jump in and go the wrong direction, do it. So this is a really cool article just on philosophy

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.340
as well.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.600
Yeah. I think it's great.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.620
And being able to know which tests actually triggered the covered line when you run a thousand

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.720
tests. Well, with these three, like, that's pretty interesting.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.340
Yeah. And you know, before I talked to him, I didn't realize that there was,

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.160
there were so many features of coverage that I didn't realize, like being able to have multiple

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.100
test runs and combine that data and HTML output and things like that. It's pretty cool.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.540
Yeah. Yeah. Quite cool. Quite cool.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.120
So what do you got for us, Michael?

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:07.980
All right. I got one, one final glorious topic for the rest of the year to round out 2016. So

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:14.840
here it is. Threaded asynchronous magic and how to wield it. So this is a really cool article by

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.700
Christian Medina. You know, we had talked about the, I don't remember exactly the title,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:26.460
but that asyncio tutorial that was like the G event tutorial remade for asyncio and Python 3.4.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.220
And we're like, well, wouldn't it be cool if there's a great one on async and await, like the really,

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:37.360
the truly new cool features of Python for threading and parallelism. Well, Christian Medina wrote it.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.020
Awesome.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.260
He wrote a really nice one and it has a bunch of bite-sized examples. You can, you know,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:48.980
they're not too, they're not too large, but they don't seem entirely fake. So he has one example of

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:54.000
like sending email notifications, sort of asynchronously, but it's like, you know, but you

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.640
realize there's no awaitable asynchronous, like way to send mail in Python. So, well, we're just going to

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.640
block, but at least we can use this asyncio loop for that. That's cool. And then also talked about the

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:12.480
aiohttp library, which is an HTTP client server for asyncio and how to do a bunch of parallel web

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:19.160
requests. So we often think about requests being the primary way that we do programming against web

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:25.540
services and generally HTTP, but this is another option that's really simple that fits exactly into

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:31.160
the asyncio. So you can easily block on the network calls, which will then free up the thread to go do

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.520
other stuff because it knows it's waiting on the network. That sounds cool. Yeah.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.240
Yeah. It's really cool. It covers things like tasks, scheduling tasks, scatter, gather styles of

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:44.620
programming, and then even moving the asyncio loop to a background thread. So you don't block up your

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.980
main thread, but you kind of have a place to put all the asynchronous work and let it run on that other

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:54.140
one thread, which is pretty cool. So yeah. So thanks Christian for doing that. Got to meet him at

00:18:54.140 --> 00:19:00.780
PyCon last year. And so that was fun. And hopefully everyone else is going to PyCon. If you don't have

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.540
your tickets yet, you need to be getting it right, Brian. Definitely. I missed out last year. So

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:10.820
don't be sad. Get tickets before they sell out because this I'm sure it will sell out. It sold

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.700
out early last year. And plus it's in Portland and Portland rocks. Portland definitely rocks. It's

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:21.500
going to be weird. They're going to be keeping it weird. All right. Well, that's it for me. I don't

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.780
really have a whole lot of news to share other than just saying thanks to everyone for listening,

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:29.920
you know, for our new podcast. It's been fun to do for you and I appreciate all the feedback.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:36.420
I appreciate it too. Speaking of feedback, we did get one person. I think it's Harry J. I hope I

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:42.080
didn't pronounce that wrong on Twitter said that he listened to episode three and I had mentioned that

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:48.000
a library called Pianini that don't know if I'm pronouncing that right, but I assumed that these were

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.680
that maybe it was named after the Knights who say knee. We thought that would be fun anyway. Yeah,

00:19:53.740 --> 00:20:01.040
definitely. But Harry J. tells me that this is not true. It's named after a Sanskrit grammarian

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:07.160
with a P-A. I don't know how to pronounce that either. It's P-A-N-I-N-I. Anyway, thanks. I like

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.600
fact checking. Yeah, it's great to have fact checkers. Awesome. I'm still going to call it Pianini.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:19.180
Knee, knee, knee. Yeah, definitely. Just know it has a different origin. Okay. Well, thank you,

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.580
Brian. Thank you everyone for listening. Thank you, Royal Bar for sponsoring the show. We will

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.140
see you all in January. Until then, you know, enjoy the winter wonderland unless you're down

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.000
in Australia, then have a nice summer. Yeah, definitely. See you next year.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.640
Yeah. See you next year. Bye everyone. Bye.
