00:00:00 Ever since Python 3.5 was released, we've had a really powerful way to write I/O bound async code

00:00:06 using the async and await keywords. On this episode, you'll meet Nathaniel Smith, who wrote

00:00:11 the Trio async framework that significantly simplifies complex coordinating operations

00:00:16 using async and await. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 167, recorded June 21st, 2018.

00:01:01 show. Nathaniel, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:05 Hey, thanks for having me.

00:01:07 It's great to have you here. I've wanted to have you on for a long time. I, you know,

00:01:10 listeners of the show probably know that I'm a fan of async programming and parallel programming.

00:01:18 It's definitely gotten some feedback and some attention, but I think it's super important

00:01:23 for Python. And I think what you're doing is incredible. Some of the stuff you showed at

00:01:27 PyCon this year was incredible. So I'm just, I'm really excited to talk about it. Yeah, it's

00:01:33 going to be fun. Before we get to that though, let's get your story into programming and Python.

00:01:36 So let's see. So for getting into programming, I mean, I guess I was fortunate in my choice of

00:01:41 parents. I was sort of, you know, born into sort of a relatively affluent family. And my mother was

00:01:47 also a professional programmer. So she mostly stopped, you know, switched to sort of part-time consulting

00:01:52 consulting when the kids came along. So she could be a stay at home mom. So actually I first learned a

00:01:58 program through in my elementary school, they did have this program, this teaching logo to us that my

00:02:05 mom created this project at my elementary school. Wow. That's pretty awesome. Many moms volunteer at

00:02:13 schools, but not any of them. Right. Learning programs. Yeah, no, you know, my mom is pretty

00:02:20 incredible. She also loves podcasts. So I mean, I guess, hey, hi, mom. Maybe she'll listen to this.

00:02:26 Yeah. I mean, she later went on to get a master's in education, and now teaches art and science and

00:02:34 programming. Yeah. But so yeah, so I got started early and was fortunate enough to have my own computer

00:02:39 starting around like age 10 and so on. So this was like in the days when I was like,

00:02:43 it was DOS. Windows 3.1 was pretty exciting. Like 386, 46 type thing. Oh yeah. Yeah. Turbo button to

00:02:50 like make it go faster. Yeah. Yeah. We don't have turbo buttons anymore. No, it just always goes fast.

00:02:55 Isn't that weird, right? Yeah. Yeah. Isn't there a little button to make your laptop half the speed?

00:02:59 Why would everyone want that? So, and then I, from there I installed Linux when I was like 13 on my

00:03:07 computer messing around. I had no idea what I was doing. It was Slackware 96 because like, was the name of it?

00:03:12 It was, it's like, you know, Windows 95 was the big thing then. So like, this was one better, right?

00:03:16 96.

00:03:17 Exactly. Yeah. Right. So yeah. So I've kind of been, you know, bumming around that kind of,

00:03:23 you know, programming open source world for something years now. It took me a little longer to get into

00:03:28 Python. I don't remember exactly when it probably, you know, five years later. So I know the first time

00:03:34 people were talking about, you know, Python was this cool new thing. It's, you know, kind of like

00:03:37 Perl, but so forth. first time I read the tutorial, I got to the point where it said that

00:03:43 Lambda was syntactically limited to a single expression and just like rage quit. I was like,

00:03:47 whatever, stupid language.

00:03:49 Where are the curly braces? Come on.

00:03:52 Yeah. Well, it wasn't, I mean, I guess also like, so like, but I had like sort of like logo,

00:03:55 I learned scheme and things like that. So like, this was like obviously terrible. I'd later came

00:04:01 back to it, got over that. And I, and under, you know, understand now why that makes sense in terms

00:04:05 of the block structure and everything, but the statement expression distinction that Python has,

00:04:10 but, it took me a little while, but yeah. So I, yeah, I guess I got into Python around

00:04:16 like 2.2 or so. And it sort of gradually become, you know, just sort of my main language.

00:04:22 In the meantime, I was also like, you know, I was getting a PhD, stuff like that. So using Python

00:04:27 for both like hobby hacking stuff. And also like for my, in my work, you know, for data analysis,

00:04:34 I wrote some various libraries there. What's your PhD in?

00:04:37 Yeah. Cognitive science.

00:04:38 Oh, right. Okay. Very awesome.

00:04:39 Yeah. Yeah. So it was like studying how people understand language and brains understand language.

00:04:44 Yeah. So yeah. So along the way, and then, yeah, getting embedded and all these different sort of,

00:04:49 you know, entangled in all these different sort of open source projects, like NumPy and so on.

00:04:53 Yeah. Yeah. That's really great. So what do you do these days?

00:04:57 So I'm actually kind of in a bit of transition right now. So the last few years, I've been

00:05:01 working at UC Berkeley at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, which is a sort of new

00:05:07 data science center. That's what started up on campus. And so in my position has been sort of

00:05:12 this unique, one really where it's, been, I've been grant funded to sort of figure out how to,

00:05:19 you know, make sure the Python, you know, continues to work well, works better for scientists. There's

00:05:25 a, actually there's a blog post we can like put a link to there. I wrote just sort of talking about

00:05:30 all this sort of stuff I've done there, but some highlights being like, I got, some grants for

00:05:35 a NumPy development, $1.3 million over a few years, which is basically the first time NumPy

00:05:41 has been funded. We'll have full-time people working on it. Did I made a color map people like,

00:05:48 did some work on packaging? So like, many Linux sort of led that effort so we can have wheels on

00:05:54 Linux now. That sounds like a really fun job. Like you get to actually make a difference in

00:06:00 the open source space. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, it partly it's, it's sort of funny. Like this is what

00:06:04 I talk about in the blog post, but like, you know, open source is just sort of like desperately underfunded.

00:06:08 And like, it's amazing how well and effectively we can use the little bits of volunteer time and

00:06:14 things that people manage or, you know, people have spending, you know, a few hours a week.

00:06:18 But there's a lot of things that like larger projects that have huge impact that can't be

00:06:24 done in that mode where you actually need to like sit down for a little while and think about it and,

00:06:28 you know, understand the landscape, put some focused effort into something.

00:06:31 Yeah. It's a difference on like what you take as your goal. If you have a month of uninterrupted full

00:06:38 time, some project or a goal part of project versus I'm going to squeeze this in

00:06:44 Saturday morning before the kids get up, right? These are the same types of things you attack.

00:06:49 Exactly. Yeah. I mean, it's like a month of time is not that much in the grand scheme of things. One

00:06:53 person, one month is like compared to, you know, the amount of labor that like, you know, Google has

00:06:58 available. Yeah. But it's still, you know, enables all kinds of things that right now just

00:07:03 aren't happening. And so there's actually lots of low hanging fruit because no, there is nobody

00:07:07 almost who has that kind of time to worry about these sort of broad open source ecosystem kind of projects.

00:07:14 There's just, there's all kinds of... We saw how much of a difference was made with the Mozilla

00:07:19 grant, the Python package.

00:07:21 Or the PyPI. Yes.

00:07:22 Yeah. The PyPI, like that was like, hey, look, $170,000. Oh, actually this can happen. It's

00:07:27 been dragging on for years. Now it's, you know, it's real.

00:07:29 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, getting the team together to make that happen. Yeah. I had a little bit of

00:07:34 involvement on that. I'm on the PSF's packaging working group. I didn't, I wasn't heavily involved

00:07:39 in that. You know, I like made some introductions, gave some feedback on the grant and things.

00:07:43 So it was, yeah, it's just super exciting to see that up close. Because yeah, it was very successful.

00:07:48 And it wasn't...

00:07:49 Like it really got a lot out of how much investment was put into it.

00:07:53 Yeah. I mean, it was like, that had been dragging on for literally six years. The old PyPI was just

00:07:58 totally unworkable. But, you know.

00:08:03 It was like Kryptonon for people who wanted to contribute to open source. They looked at it and

00:08:08 like, oh, no, no, I'm not touching that. That's...

00:08:10 Yeah. I made one patch to the old PyPI. And it was just a trivial thing. It was just that we wanted it

00:08:16 to start to say that, oh yeah, many Linux is now a legal thing for a wheel to have in its name.

00:08:21 So it was just like, there's like a list of strings that allowed, I'm just adding one new string,

00:08:25 right? That was the most terrifying patch I've ever made. PR I've ever made. Because it's like,

00:08:30 if I have a typo, then PyPI dies, right? And there are no tests. There's nothing, right?

00:08:37 The consequences of failure is so high.

00:08:40 Yeah. Exactly.

00:08:41 Yeah. The new PyPI is way, way better. You should all go and help make it contribute. Because now

00:08:47 it's all set up. You can develop locally and there's a real test suite.

00:08:52 Yeah. It's really nice. I had the people involved on the show a couple episodes back too. So it

00:08:58 definitely got a chance to dig into that. Oh yeah. Right. That's right. Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:01 So let's talk a little bit about async. Yeah.

00:09:04 Yeah.

00:09:04 Because I think that that's one of the sort of revitalized areas of Python last,

00:09:09 since 3.4, 3.5, it really started coming along, right? So what, in 3.4, we got asyncio as a thing.

00:09:16 And in 3.5, it really, I feel like it really got more accessible with async and await.

00:09:22 Right. With the new syntax features to make it easier to use. Exactly. Yeah.

00:09:26 Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like the keep it, the foundation was built previously, but it was,

00:09:31 it was still this sort of callback hell type of programming, right? Right.

00:09:37 Right. We should maybe take a little bit of a step back and just, you know, let people know about

00:09:42 the presentation you gave at PyCon, which introduces your project TRIA, which is what we're going to

00:09:46 focus on. But in your talk, you sort of set the stage and said, look, there's these two

00:09:51 philosophies or types of async programming that you might consider. So maybe, maybe you could touch on

00:09:58 that a little. Well, so, I mean, I think the first thing to say is for those who aren't kind of already,

00:10:03 you know, up on the jargon, async is sort of a subset of concurrent programming. And so concurrency,

00:10:08 meaning writing programs that do two things at the same time, which is very handy. You know,

00:10:14 it's something in our real life we do all the time, you know, you know, I'm working on one thing and my

00:10:18 friends working on another thing at the same time. It's very natural. But writing a program that does

00:10:22 that is a little bit trickier, especially, you know, in Python is kind of generally a sequential

00:10:27 language, right? It makes it easy to do, I want to do this and then that and then the other thing.

00:10:31 It doesn't directly have built into like the syntax, whatever ways to say, I want to do these

00:10:36 two things at the same time. And then when they're both done, do these other things.

00:10:39 So, so generally, there's this general question of like, how do you write concurrent programs in Python?

00:10:43 And then I think what you were thinking of, there's kind of two philosophies of concurrency,

00:10:48 which is one is the kind of preemptive concurrency that threads give you, where just everything

00:10:56 just kind of runs all the time interleaved kind of in arbitrary ways.

00:11:00 To be clear, this is in general threads, not Python threads, because we have this whole

00:11:04 thing called the gil.

00:11:05 From the programmer, from the user's point of view, the gil doesn't make, gil makes things

00:11:09 slower, but it doesn't make it really change what it feels like to use it compared to threads in

00:11:14 general. True.

00:11:15 So in general in threads, you might have like two threads actually running at the same time,

00:11:20 like on two different views. Because of Python, we have the global interpreter off the gil,

00:11:24 multiple, then it means that mostly only one thread can actually run at a time.

00:11:28 But because in Python interpreter controls that, it can decide at any moment to switch which thread

00:11:33 is running. From your point of view, as writing code in Python, it might as well be running multiple

00:11:38 things at the same time, basically, right? Because since it could switch at any moment,

00:11:42 you kind of have to act like it's just constantly switching, right?

00:11:45 And the reason this is kind of a challenge is because if you have a data structure, and you have two

00:11:50 different threads or whatever, you know, you have two different concurrent pieces of code acting on

00:11:55 the data structure at the same time, if they're not like, if you're not careful, you can make a big

00:11:59 mess. So like, you know, one, you have the classic examples are things like, you know, your program is

00:12:05 like managing like a bank. And so I'm going to withdraw money from this account, and then add it,

00:12:09 put it in this account. But if you don't do that, like atomically, so like ice, you know, first one,

00:12:14 one thread says, okay, does Alice have enough money? Yeah, great. Okay, I'll take that money out and put it

00:12:19 into Bob's account. Another thread says, oh, does Alice have enough money for this transfer to Carl?

00:12:24 And then if they're in a leave right, first both threads check and say, oh, yeah, Alice has plenty of money.

00:12:28 And then both threads take money out of the account. And now Alice has spent the same money twice, actually.

00:12:33 Yeah, great for Alice, but not so nice for the bank.

00:12:35 So yeah, someone's gonna be trouble running writing that software.

00:12:40 Yeah, right. So yeah, if you're writing that software, you need to sort of manage this.

00:12:44 Yeah. So one of the things that kind of helped me this like click in my mind was

00:12:48 thinking about how programs temporarily enter these invalid states.

00:12:54 Right.

00:12:55 What you're describing is basically that like at the beginning of that function,

00:12:59 the bank is in a valid state. At the end of the function, everything is valid. But somewhere in

00:13:04 between in order to accomplish that operations as a series of steps, it has to become invalid. And

00:13:09 long as nobody observes it in this invalid state, it's all good. But when they do like, like you're

00:13:16 describing halfway through, it's not okay anymore. It's kind of like transactions and databases,

00:13:21 but in time. And yeah, they're pretty similar in some ways, I guess.

00:13:25 Yeah. So yeah, exactly. So with threads, which the solution to this is you have to sort of explicitly,

00:13:31 like, make sure you notice all those places where you're passing through that invalid state and do

00:13:36 some kind of in like market somehow in your source code, like say, okay, I'm going to take a lock here.

00:13:40 That's going to make sure that anyone else who tries to use this has to wait for me to be done

00:13:44 and things get back to the valid state before they can look at it. Right?

00:13:48 Yeah, exactly. Okay. But that's really error pro.

00:13:51 And this is preemptive concurrency, right?

00:13:53 Yeah, exactly. It's still talking about kind of how threads work, right?

00:13:55 Yep. So you would have to like find all these places where you go through a temporarily

00:13:59 invalid state and mark them in your source code. And if you forget one, then you have this nasty bug

00:14:05 where Alice gets to suspend the money twice or all kinds of weird things can happen.

00:14:10 And it usually has to do with timing. And so it's very, super hard to debug.

00:14:13 Yeah. And it's like, yeah, it's like super subtle. Like, yeah, like it only happens one in a thousand times randomly. And it happens,

00:14:20 it depends how much memory you have. And it's only happens in production and not on your tests.

00:14:23 And just all kinds of, it's really, really, yeah, it's bad. Yeah.

00:14:27 Yeah. I've heard them described as Heisen bugs. And I just love that term.

00:14:30 Yes. Yes. Heisen bugs. Right. And it's just like, and so it means that when you're working with threads,

00:14:34 you just have to be like constantly vigilant, right? Like every line of code,

00:14:37 which we think, okay, is this the one that's going to introduce this terrible bug?

00:14:40 So that's, that sucks, right? You don't want to live like that.

00:14:44 So, yeah, right. You just have to be like constantly paranoid. So yeah. So the idea for

00:14:51 async concurrency, because we kind of flip it around instead of saying that like, okay,

00:14:56 we have to go through and find all the places in the source code where something dangerous is

00:15:01 happening and mark those. You say, you know what, let's be conservative. Let's assume something

00:15:05 dangerous could be happening anywhere. That's the default. So by default, only one thing is allowed to

00:15:09 happen at a time. And then we'll mark in the source code, you know, okay, here's a place where

00:15:14 I want to let other things happen. It's okay for, I'm not in the middle of, you know, just doing some

00:15:19 delicate operation, you know, adjusting someone's bank account. This is a fine place for that to happen.

00:16:17 talkpython.fm/linode.

00:16:20 And you can still have bugs. You can still make mistakes and put that in the wrong place.

00:16:26 Because now there's only like a finite number of places to check when something goes wrong, right?

00:16:31 It's just much easier to reason about that kind of program.

00:16:34 Right. And that could be done with just straight up asyncio. But with three, five and above,

00:16:39 like basically the await keyword is the marker in your code for that.

00:16:44 Exactly. Yeah.

00:16:45 Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty beautiful. That's pretty beautiful. So I'm guessing,

00:16:50 I'm guessing most people probably under understand like how to use async and await the keywords,

00:16:54 but maybe just describe like what's, how to define like a super, super simple async method with the

00:17:01 keyword, just to the people understand this.

00:17:02 Yeah. Like you said, I'm going to be focusing on trio here and trio does kind of use only kind of a

00:17:07 simple subset. There's some extra complexity needed for like backwards compatibility with async

00:17:12 IOS sort of called that place thing. We can get, talk about that more later. But sort of for if,

00:17:17 especially if you're just, you know, if you're using trio, async await is very simple actually.

00:17:21 And so here's what you need to know is that there are two kinds of functions. There's the async ones,

00:17:26 which are these, the special functions that might let other code run during them. And so you kind of

00:17:31 need to be aware of what you call one of them that like, you know, the ground might shift under

00:17:35 feet, data structures might change while it's happening. And there's the regular functions,

00:17:40 like the synchronous functions where those always happen atomically. And so, and we're going to do is

00:17:45 we're going to make all the regular Python functions you already know, those are going to be the synchronous

00:17:49 ones. Because, you know, no one, you know, they're all written on the assumption that like, you know,

00:17:53 Python's a sequential language, it does things sequentially. And so they, no one like thought about

00:17:58 how to handle this async stuff when they were writing all these libraries that already exist.

00:18:03 So those are going to be all atomic. And then we need a way to mark these special async functions.

00:18:09 And we want to mark it at two places. So what we want to mark it when we define the function

00:18:12 so that we, you know, as part of the API, is this an async function or not? And we want to mark it at

00:18:18 the call sites. When you call one of these, when you're like reading through your code, you see, ah,

00:18:22 this is a point where I'm calling an async function. This is a point where other code might run in the

00:18:26 background, I need to make sure I'm not in the middle of some, you know, dangerous operation.

00:18:29 Right?

00:18:30 Right. Okay. So you've got like, maybe a call to a web service or something.

00:18:34 Yeah, that might return like a future, which then you hook in a call.

00:18:39 So there are no futures in Trio. That was one of the things I got rid of.

00:18:43 Yes. Yeah, that's beautiful. Yeah. But you got to, you have to wait on the result, basically.

00:18:48 Right?

00:18:49 So yeah. I mean, so yeah, so the way, yeah, the way you think about it for Trio is just that,

00:18:54 it's just like, there are these special functions and the way you call it is you type

00:18:57 a weight and then the function call. It's like a new kind of syntax for calling a function.

00:19:01 Right.

00:19:02 And that's sort of all you need to know. There is, yeah, like you said, like there's the

00:19:05 complexities around Python also supports a weighting on objects and having future objects,

00:19:09 like the function to return and so on and so forth. But it's kind of unnecessary clutter is

00:19:14 kind of how Trio's perspective on it. So we just don't do any of that.

00:19:17 Yeah. I feel like the AsyncIO layer is like, let's get something kind of working,

00:19:22 but it's not that delightful. And I feel like Trio really cleans it up. So there's a really great

00:19:28 example that you gave in your talk about happy eyeballs, which is like a way to try to use

00:19:33 basically DNS resolution to connect a socket to a server and some concurrency stuff around that,

00:19:39 which is, I don't want to talk about that yet. Maybe we'll have some time to talk about it later. But

00:19:43 basically there's a version in Twisted, which is how long was the one in Twisted? Hundreds?

00:19:49 And so, yeah, well, yeah, there's two different versions of Twisted I talked about in the talk.

00:19:54 One is the sort of the classic one that's in in master, which is like 120 lines long, I think,

00:20:00 roughly. I mean, not that it's not super meaningful to talk about lines of code like this, but like

00:20:04 just kind of give you a sense. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

00:20:07 A better sense of complicated is to reason about that is it has inside this method. It has another

00:20:12 internal function. Inside that function, there's another function defined. And then inside that,

00:20:16 there's a fourth level of internal functions. So like, yeah, that's bad.

00:20:20 Because it's all these. Yeah. Yeah.

00:20:24 Almost like it's full of all these go to's and in some weird sense. And then, and you basically say,

00:20:30 now, if we apply the building blocks or the primitives of trio to it, oh, look, it's like 20 lines,

00:20:34 and it's totally straightforward, which is really great. So I think, you know, let's talk about trio.

00:20:40 Why don't you start by telling people what it is. Trio is a library for a sink concurrency in Python.

00:20:45 It's like an alternative to libraries like a sink or twisted or so on, which NATO or threads,

00:20:52 sort of all of them. And I think there's kind of, I think it was, there's kind of two pieces. So one

00:20:57 is there's sort of the idea trio, the ideas are like a research project or something where I have,

00:21:03 I sort of did some analysis of like, what is it about twisted and I think I own someone that makes

00:21:08 it so difficult to use sometimes, or why are things like happy eyeballs so complicated?

00:21:13 Where are some common errors sort of come from? It came up like, oh, that's actually I sort of,

00:21:18 as I dug into it, I realized actually, there's, you know, a small number of things that kind of

00:21:21 seem to cause a lot of the problems, and even ended up digging into some old literature from like the

00:21:26 60s, about early programming language design. On Univac or what was that one on? That was like

00:21:32 a really old computer. Oh, oh, Flowmatic. The, that language, which is, yeah, the Grace Hopper's

00:21:38 language, the precursor to COBOL, which is a really interesting language. That's going way back. Yeah.

00:21:42 Yeah. Yeah. And sort of talking about this transition, there was a lot of debates then about like,

00:21:47 how do you structure your language, not even getting into the concurrency part, just like,

00:21:51 how do you do a language at all that's like usable? And one of the big things that happened was

00:21:56 this switch from using go to as the main control structure to having things like if statements and

00:22:02 functions and for loops and so on. And I realized there's actually sort of an analogy there that's

00:22:08 surprisingly like precise between a lot of that, a lot of these async libraries are actually still

00:22:16 kind of in the go to stage, where sort of the basic primitives are in sort of a technical way,

00:22:21 kind of analogous to a go to, and they cause similar kinds of problems. And then if you look at,

00:22:25 okay, how did, you know, Dijkstra solve these problems back in the late sixties,

00:22:29 we can take those and apply them to concurrency. And that leads to something called,

00:22:34 I call it a nursery concept. Yeah. It's so interesting. And I had, yeah. And I had never

00:22:38 thought about the relationship between go to and many of these programming, these threaded programming

00:22:44 models, but you really hit it. Well, I think it's a super good analogy and it's really relevant.

00:22:50 Because so what Dijkstra said was, look, you should be able to treat these building blocks as black boxes.

00:22:56 Stuff goes in, stuff goes out. That's all. If you know kind of what it does, you don't need the details,

00:23:01 right? I mean, this is like a huge part of abstraction and programming, like functions,

00:23:05 classes, it's modules, et cetera. Right. Like, like even just think of like,

00:23:09 like in Python, think of the print function, right? Like in actually it does all kinds of complicated

00:23:17 stuff, right? It's got talking to the operating system interfaces to do IO and it's like buffer

00:23:22 a thing and character second version and blah, blah, blah. But like, you don't have to care about

00:23:26 that. You just type print hello world. And it, you know, it prints all the world.

00:23:30 You can just treat that as like this little atomic unit. And that's great.

00:23:33 That kind of. Yeah. It's such an important part of a building block of programming,

00:23:36 but these threads mean that stuff can still be going. You're just like all over the place. Right.

00:23:41 And it's very similar to the go-to's, which I thought that was a great analogy.

00:23:44 Yeah. I mean, specifically the issue is, so like, let's say the, the analog of print,

00:23:48 like in say twisted, you have this transport object. That's like your connection,

00:23:52 like a network connection and you call it's right method. And this is like,

00:23:55 I want to send this data to the remote site now. And that's like a function. You call it

00:23:59 it returns. That's all fine. But what's sort of confusing is that when you call it,

00:24:04 it returns, it hasn't actually finished yet. What it's actually done is sort of scheduled

00:24:08 that right to happen in the background. And that makes it hard to reason about the flow.

00:24:12 Cause it's like, Oh, the functions returned, but actually in a sense, it's like kind of still running.

00:24:17 Right. And now if I want to write and then do something else that happens after that,

00:24:21 that's hard to manage because I don't necessarily know when that's actually finished. I have to use some

00:24:26 other API to like check and ask, okay, has it actually written yet?

00:24:29 Yeah. And so yeah.

00:24:30 Did it succeed? Did it not succeed? Then how do you deal with that? And then how do you get that

00:24:34 back into your, yeah, your whole, it's yeah. It feels like almost like JavaScript.

00:24:37 Well, I mean, JavaScript, you know, is also in this general family of like, yeah,

00:24:42 it is as this async currency model that's sort of endemic to it. We use all over the place and it's

00:24:48 all callback based and it's all, yeah, it has that same kind of go-to problem.

00:24:52 Yeah, exactly. So let's talk about the architecture and then maybe like we can see about how that kind

00:24:58 of brings us back into something that Dykstra might be proud of.

00:25:01 Okay. Sure. Yeah. I guess I should also mention, so I don't know how, this is a discussion that really benefits from like diagrams, which is not something podcasts or

00:25:11 there is also, I have a blog post called notes on structured concurrency or go statement considered

00:25:18 harmful, which goes into this and sort of this set of ideas and much more detailed pictures and all

00:25:23 that. But so yeah, so the basically the idea is that, I mean, so it's what I said, right? That like,

00:25:27 when you call a function, it should be something you can treat as a black box. It does some stuff,

00:25:32 it returns. That's kind of what Dykstra's point. I mean, that's the problem with go to is also that

00:25:36 like, you know, the old go to world, you could call a function and maybe it returns, maybe it jumps

00:25:43 somewhere else, maybe some other function and some other point of your code suddenly returns instead

00:25:47 because the control go to just lets, you know, functions have a certain control flow they're supposed

00:25:52 to have, right? Where you have your function and then you call something. So control jumps into that

00:25:56 function. It executes that code and then it comes back again to your function. That's kind of this

00:26:00 nice little structure. That's why it's, you could treat it as a black box because you know, oh, it'll

00:26:03 do some stuff, but then it'll come back. Right. Go to isn't like that. It's just, it's just a one way

00:26:08 you leap off somewhere else and then maybe you come back, you could jump back, it's something you do manually.

00:26:13 Choose your own adventure book. You don't know when you're done, you don't know where to begin or

00:26:19 you're just like, it's always a mess. It's always a surprise. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's choose your own

00:26:23 adventure accepted. Then you're like, you know, actually I want to switch. I'm going to, it says

00:26:26 I can go to page five or 10, but I'm going to 17. Let's see what happens. So yeah. So in that,

00:26:32 and that breaks this function abstraction, right? So it means like you call a function and you know,

00:26:36 hopefully like if it's like a nice, well-written library and people aren't like messing with you,

00:26:41 it will come back normally. But there's no kind of guarantee of that in the language. Like if

00:26:46 someone decided to be clever, they could, it could do something else. It could jump somewhere else.

00:26:50 And then it becomes very hard to sort of reason about the overall structure of your program,

00:26:54 if that's true. And it also breaks sort of higher level structures that people are using the program.

00:26:59 But like, so, so think about exceptions, right? So it's very, a handy thing about exceptions is like,

00:27:04 oh, something goes wrong. Then, you know, and I didn't think about how to deal with it locally,

00:27:09 then the exception will propagate out in Python. And so until either someone catches it and knows how to

00:27:14 deal with it, or the program crashes, you get a trace back and like, that's not great. But at least,

00:27:18 you know, you didn't just like go blindly on doing the wrong thing. At least, you know,

00:27:22 you get a trace back, you can try and figure out what's going, what happened, right?

00:27:25 But not with, not with threading. Not if you care.

00:27:28 Well, okay, well, we'll get there in a moment, right? But if you have go to,

00:27:32 then it's where do you, when you raise an exception, it goes up the stack, right? It's like,

00:27:37 okay, does this function want to handle it? Okay. How about it's caller? How about it's caller's

00:27:40 caller? Right? Because you have this nice stack kind of, you know, you know who the caller is,

00:27:45 you know who the caller's caller is. If you have go to, then control just bounces around sort of at

00:27:50 random. So who wants to know about this exception? Like I don't have a well-defined sense of a caller

00:27:54 even, right? It's just like these basic things we take for granted growing up and you know, this,

00:27:59 you know, our ancestors struggled with and sort of fixed for us. And now we take for granted,

00:28:03 right? But like these basic assumptions just aren't there in the language of go to.

00:28:06 Yeah. With blocks have similar issues, right? So like a with block is supposed to like,

00:28:10 you say with open file and then you know, okay, inside the block, the file's open,

00:28:14 outside the block, the file's closed. That's nice. It's great. It makes it easy to manage resources.

00:28:20 But if you have go to, you like, you jump into the middle of a block, you jump out of the middle of

00:28:23 the block. Like what happens is the, where does the file open and close? Like how does that even,

00:28:27 I don't even, it doesn't work, right? Exactly. Yeah. So yeah. And then, then if you look at like problems we're dealing with threads or things that are a struggle and like

00:28:38 asyncio or twisted, but these are just kind of the things that are problematic, right? So you call

00:28:43 a function, is it, you know, it's still running maybe when it returns, it makes it hard to like

00:28:46 control sequencing, hard to treat things to black boxes. Like you don't know, like you need to like,

00:28:51 go read the source code when you use some random, asyncio like based library to find out like,

00:28:57 okay, I called this function, but did it actually do the thing then? Or is it scheduled something in

00:29:01 the background? Like you have to go, does the error go to the caller or does it go to the callback?

00:29:05 Right. Yeah. So if you spawn off this background thread or background task, as I think it calls it,

00:29:10 and it crashes, there's an error. There's an unhandled exception with that. Well, you've lost,

00:29:17 you don't have a nice sort of call stack that you've, you've spun up this new independent entity that's

00:29:21 executing and it's now split apart from your original code. And so there's sort of like, where does that

00:29:27 if there's an unhandled error, an exception, then what actually happens is that in threads and

00:29:32 they sync IO and twist or whatever, is it, you know, maybe print something on standard, like,

00:29:36 hey, I hope someone's looking, something went wrong. Then it throws away the exception and it carries on.

00:29:41 And you know, hopefully... It does make your software more reliable, because there's way fewer crashes when you don't actually... Well, for some value of reliable,

00:29:48 right? Yeah. Exactly. Nice. Okay. So what are the building blocks of Trio that like...

00:29:53 Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So the main thing that is, in Trio, we have this thing we call a nursery.

00:29:59 And the idea, it's just a sort of a silly joke, right? About if you want to spawn a child task,

00:30:04 then it's not okay for it just to be go off independently. Like it has, you have to like,

00:30:08 put it somewhere and it'll be like taken care of. It's like a nursery is where children live.

00:30:13 Okay. So concretely, what it is, is if you want to spawn a child task in Trio, you have to first

00:30:19 have a nursery object. The way you get a nursery object is you write async with Trio.openNursery as

00:30:24 nursery. So it's like this open, you have like a with block that opens a nursery and then you get this

00:30:29 nursery object. And the object is tied to that with block. And so, and then once you have that,

00:30:34 you can say nursery, there's a method on that nursery to spawn a task into it. And all the tasks you

00:30:38 spawn to the nursery will run concurrently. But then the trick is that that with block,

00:30:44 its lifetime in the parent is tied to the lifetime of the child tasks. So that you can't exit the

00:30:50 with block while there's still children running. If you hit the end of the with block, then the

00:30:53 parent just stops and waits for them. The stuff within the with block could be interwoven

00:30:58 and like in certain ways, async and concurrent. But taken as a whole, the with block is like a black box.

00:31:05 You start it, it runs, and then out comes the answer at the end, and everything's done,

00:31:10 or it's gotten into its canceled state or whatever happens to it, right?

00:31:13 Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And so right. And that so that lets us do things like so right. So now,

00:31:18 if you call a function in Trio, you know, well, okay, it might internally open a nursery and have

00:31:23 some currency. But by the time it finishes, it's done, it hasn't left anything running. Or if you have,

00:31:28 if something crashes, we have some child task, you know, has an exception that is no, it doesn't catch,

00:31:34 then we say, okay, what do we do with this? Oh, well, wait, the parent is just sitting there waiting

00:31:37 for the child. So that's what we do is the exception hops into the parent and continues executing. So

00:31:43 in there, sorry, continues like propagating out. So Trio sort of follows the normal Python rule of,

00:31:48 you know, you can catch an exception, but if you don't, then it will keep propagating until someone

00:31:52 does. Right. So that nursery is a really important block block here. And I think, you know, it's,

00:32:00 it's really cool to be able to start all these child tasks and they can even be sort of children

00:32:05 of the children, right? Like you could pass the nursery and the child task could spawn more child

00:32:09 tasks and whatever. And so it's all going to sort of be done at the end.

00:32:15 This portion of talk Python to me has been brought to you by roll bar. One of the frustrating things

00:32:19 about being a developer is dealing with errors, relying on users report errors, digging through

00:32:25 log files, trying to debug issues, or getting millions of alerts, just flooding your inbox and ruining your

00:32:30 day. With roll bars, full stack error monitoring, you get the context insight and control you need to

00:32:35 find and fix bugs faster. Adding roll bar to your Python app is as easy as pip install roll bar. You can

00:32:42 start tracking production errors and deployments in eight minutes or less. Are you considering

00:32:46 self hosting tools for security or compliance reasons? Then you should really check out roll bars,

00:32:51 compliance SAS option, get advanced security features and meet compliance without the hassle of self

00:32:57 hosting, including HIPAA ISO 27001 privacy shield and more. They'd love to give you a demo. Give roll bar a

00:33:05 try today. Go to talkpython.fm/roll bar and check them out.

00:33:09 The other thing that's really important in this type of threading is to not block forever, to not wait

00:33:17 on something forever, right?

00:33:19 Oh yeah, so you're talking about timeouts and cancel scopes.

00:33:22 Timeouts and cancel scopes and all that stuff.

00:33:24 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:24 Yeah, so this is a really basic problem. If you're doing anything, kind of network programming,

00:33:29 for example, or any kind of thing, your programs talking to other programs, other resources,

00:33:36 because sometimes those will just stop responding. So it's like, if you make an HTTP request,

00:33:42 then maybe it'll succeed. Maybe it'll fail, you'll get a 404 or something like that.

00:33:48 Or, but there's also a third possibility, which is that it just never finishes, right? Like the

00:33:54 network disappeared and it just like sits there forever. And your program, yeah. And like, you kind

00:34:00 of, and I mean, if it's just writing a little script or whatever, it's like that you're running

00:34:04 at the command line, it's fine. You know, you have some point you'll get bored and hit control C,

00:34:06 it's fine. But for sort of more complicated systems, you need to be robust against this.

00:34:11 Yeah.

00:34:11 Or unattended systems.

00:34:13 Yeah.

00:34:13 Like, well, we have 10 workers, but we're only getting this super low throughput. Why? Well,

00:34:17 because eight of them are like just blocked forever.

00:34:19 Yeah. You need to somehow, you know, detect this, be able to get out and say, okay, actually,

00:34:24 let's stop doing that. Try something else, raise an error or something, but like, you know,

00:34:29 not just sit there forever. So that means, yeah, there's just like, and this is just a problem

00:34:34 that's just endemic, right? It's just every time you do any kind of networking or other kinds of IPC,

00:34:40 you need to have this kind of timeout support. So that's one thing that makes it tricky.

00:34:43 The other thing that makes timeouts tricky is that usually the place where you need to set

00:34:47 the timeout is like buried way, way down deep inside the code. It's like, at some point your

00:34:52 HTTP client, you know, is using some socket library and the socket library is like trying to send some

00:34:58 bytes or read some bytes from the network, like a very, very low level operation. That's probably buried

00:35:02 under like five levels of abstraction. But then where you want to set the timeout is like way out at the

00:35:07 top where you say like, I just want to say, if this HTTP request isn't done in 10 seconds,

00:35:11 then give up. So timeouts are this problem that's like, you need them everywhere and you need

00:35:16 coordination across different layers of your system. So it's this really complicated problem that like

00:35:21 covers, you really kind of need your timeout framework that's like used universally by everyone

00:35:28 and kind of like coordinates, can coordinate across the system.

00:35:31 And it can be super tricky. Like imagine you want to call like two web services and do a database

00:35:37 transaction. And if one times out, you want them all to like roll. Yeah. Right. Which is like super,

00:35:43 like how do you coordinate that? Like there's just, you know, like, yeah, almost impossible. Right. Unless,

00:35:49 yeah. Unless you put it in trio. So yeah. So right. Yeah. So the traditional way to do this is like,

00:35:53 you have a timeout framework sort of inside each library, like inside, you know, your HTTP client has a

00:35:58 timeout argument that you pass or whatever, but that doesn't help with people just don't do that

00:36:03 reliably. And yeah. And it doesn't solve these coordination problems. So in trio, you say like,

00:36:07 no, this is something that we're just going to bake into the library, the IO library itself.

00:36:12 So all libraries that work with trio, if you have an issue that in trio, it uses trio's timeout system.

00:36:18 And so in this, this thing called cancel scope. So again, there's a lot more details on this in a

00:36:23 blog post that I wrote called timeouts and cancellation for humans. We'll put the link up there.

00:36:28 Podcast description, I guess. But in basically, yeah, it's, it's fairly simple to use. Basically,

00:36:34 the way it works is you can just anywhere in your code, say, you know, with timeout,

00:36:38 10 seconds, and then you put code inside that with block. And if it takes more than 10 seconds,

00:36:45 then trio raises a special exception called canceled that just sort of, you know, unwinds out of there.

00:36:51 And then that with block catches the exception. So, you know, it's a way of saying, okay,

00:36:55 whatever's happening with block, stop doing that, and then carry on at that point.

00:37:00 The other nice thing that's important about this, as compared to a lot of other systems we're doing,

00:37:04 working with timeouts and this cancellation, is that we have the with block to limits, like you can say,

00:37:10 this is the operation that I want to cancel, which is really important. So like asyncio doesn't work like this.

00:37:17 So when I think IO, you can say, I want to cancel something, and that injects the special exception,

00:37:21 but then there's nothing that keeps track of, you can't look at the exception, figure out, okay,

00:37:25 did I want to cancel this specific network operation, or this HTTP request, or this like entire program,

00:37:34 like, kind of, you don't keep track of that. When trio, because we said it's with block, we can say,

00:37:39 okay, I know this is the actual set, this is the operation that I'm trying to cancel right now.

00:37:44 And these can be nested.

00:37:46 Yeah, it's awesome. And you, if you want to do like a timeout, you can create a with block that says,

00:37:50 basically, do this to success or fail after 10 seconds. What is the syntax for that? It's like,

00:37:57 async with, I forget.

00:37:58 This one is just a regular with.

00:38:00 Okay.

00:38:00 Because, so async with is just like a regular with except that a regular with does, calls a method at

00:38:06 the beginning and the end of the block. And async with does an await call of a method at the beginning

00:38:10 of the block. And we talk about a weight being the special, you know, thing we call these special

00:38:14 functions. Yeah. And so for, it happens that for tree for timeouts, for nurseries, you have to use

00:38:20 an async with because at the end of the block, it might, the parent might have to wait for the

00:38:24 children. And you want to let them run while it's waiting. Right. So it has to be an await there.

00:38:30 So let's use async with for a timeout. You're just, you know, setting something at the beginning

00:38:34 of the end, but there's, it doesn't, it doesn't have to actually like stop and wait for, let other

00:38:37 things run there. It can be synchronous. That's just a little detail, but yeah. So it's, it's basically,

00:38:42 so with block, what we, the main one, sort of this basic one is called move on after to kind

00:38:46 of remind you that it's going to run the code. And then if the timeout happened, it doesn't

00:38:51 raise an exception. Like it, you can stop and see, okay, did it, was it canceled or not? But like,

00:38:55 it keeps executing after the block. So you can like, look at it, which is, this again has to do with,

00:39:00 like, like the simplest case for a timeout is just like, okay, if the timeout expires,

00:39:04 blow up everything, give up, raise an exception, right? But a lot of times you want to say, oh,

00:39:09 well, did this thing get canceled? If so, do some fallback, do something else. So the core thing in

00:39:16 Trio is, is not to raise an exception after that. It's like to provide some object you can look at to

00:39:20 see what happened and then figure out how you want to deal with it.

00:39:23 Yeah. The other thing that I thought you did well with these cancellation scopes is if there's an

00:39:30 exception on one of the tasks and there's a bunch running in one of these width blocks, you can

00:39:35 catch that and use that to cancel the other ones and just say, no, no, things are going wrong. We're

00:39:40 out of here. Every, all threads are done. We're out of here. Yeah. So yeah. So the nurseries actually

00:39:46 kind of need the cancel scopes because what, one of the things the nurseries do is this exception

00:39:51 family thing, right? So if an exception happens in a child, it isn't caught, then it has to hop

00:39:55 into the parent. So we have this kind of, I guess the way I think about it is normally you think of

00:39:59 like your call stack. It's like this little chain of like, you know, A calls B calls C calls D,

00:40:03 right? What nurseries do is they kind of make it that into like a tree. So like A calls B, B calls C and D

00:40:10 and E sort of simultaneously. And then maybe D calls several things at the same time, right? So you have

00:40:15 this kind of like this tree structure of your, for your call stack. And now some exception happens down

00:40:20 inside one of those branches. Well, what do you do with exceptions? You unwind the stack,

00:40:24 right? You go, you run any handlers inside that function. And then you go up to the parent,

00:40:28 you kill that functions call and you move in there and run any handlers there and so on.

00:40:33 But then we have this problem. If you're going up, unwinding the stack, and you hit one of these

00:40:36 places where branch, the stack now branches, how do you sort of unwind past that point? Right?

00:40:41 You don't want to like orphan the other children, like you just unwind the parent without

00:40:46 stopping them because that's our whole thing in Trio, right? We say we're not going to let

00:40:49 orphans run around unsupervised. That's a bad idea. Dijkstra doesn't like that. So what we do is,

00:40:58 but we have to unwind the stack, right? So what we do is we use the cancellation at that point to go and

00:41:02 we cancel all the other tasks that are inside that same nursery. So we sort of prune the tree,

00:41:08 unwind those tasks back up to this point. And then we can keep unwinding from there with the original

00:41:13 exception. Yeah, that's, that's really clever. I really like the way you put it all together.

00:41:18 So there's also some other pieces, like some file system bits. I love the, the whole trick of saying

00:41:26 like a wait sleep for a little bit of time, just go, I'm basically yielding this thread to let it do

00:41:32 other work, but then just carry on as opposed to say like a time.sleep and things like that.

00:41:37 So maybe tell us about the higher order of building blocks.

00:41:39 Yeah. So I guess, yeah, so far we've sort of been talking about kind of the core ideas in Trio, which

00:41:43 are, you know, not specific to Trio the project. In fact, there's so, I've had a, talking to a number

00:41:48 of other language designers or other languages, like, oh, this is interesting. We're also struggling with

00:41:52 these problems. But then, yeah, but Trio is also a specific project you can download. It has

00:41:57 documentation and API and all that. And one of the things I try to do with that project is to make

00:42:02 it sort of really sort of usable and accessible, kind of have this philosophy of like, the, you know,

00:42:07 kind of the buck stops here for developer experience. Like if there's something that you're trying to,

00:42:12 you're trying to write a program using Trio and there's something awkward or difficult or a problem

00:42:16 you have, then it's up to us to solve that. And even maybe it's, it's so we, it's, we have the project

00:42:22 itself. We also have things like that, like, you know, has the core, like networking and concurrency

00:42:27 stuff. We also have testing helpers and we have a documentation, like a plugins for Sphinx to make

00:42:34 it easier to document these things. And so there's something called pytest-Trio. How's that work with

00:42:40 that? So the main thing that pytest-Trio gives you is that you can have, when you write a test, you can say,

00:42:46 okay, I guess we need to give a little more information here. So Trio, there's sort of a

00:42:52 stereotype pattern that all Trio programs for, where you have like an async def main or whatever you want

00:42:57 to call it. That's like your top level async function. That's like, that's where you go into

00:43:02 that Trio's magic async mode. If you use all the Trio stuff.

00:43:04 Right. So maybe you start by saying trio.run main.

00:43:08 Yeah. Yeah. So the thing about async functions, you can only call them from other async functions.

00:43:12 So you have this problem. How do you call your first async function? And that's what trio.run.

00:43:17 So you have this little bit of ceremony at the very top of every Trio program. And this is also the case

00:43:22 for like asyncio and so on. But like, you say, I have to like switch into trio mode. And that's kind of

00:43:27 annoying in a test suite to do that on every single test. So that's the most basic thing that pytest-Trio

00:43:31 does for you is it makes it so you can write async def test, whatever, and it will take care of like

00:43:37 setting up trio and turning it on there. But it also has some other handy stuff. So one thing

00:43:42 is that it allows you to have async fixtures. And it does some sort of magic to like goes,

00:43:47 it switches into trio mode, and then sets up your fixtures and then calls your test,

00:43:50 and then tears down the fixtures. So it's sort of all within this async context.

00:43:54 And it's also integrated with some of the testing helpers that are built into trio itself.

00:43:59 So in particular, the one that's sort of the most, you know, gee whiz, awesome,

00:44:03 is that trio has this ability to use a fake clock. So this is an issue when you're writing like

00:44:10 networking programs. Like often you want to like have a test about, okay, what does happen if this

00:44:15 HE request just hangs forever? Like do my timeouts work correctly? Stuff like that, right? But it's

00:44:20 really annoying to run these tests because it's like, okay, and now I have to sit and wait for a

00:44:25 minute for the timeout to fire and make sure something happens. And that happens every time you run your

00:44:29 test. It just spends a minute sitting there doing nothing. And you're like, I really like, okay, but

00:44:34 like, this is really boring. I want my test suite to finish already. And I need like 100 of these

00:44:38 tests. And yeah.

00:44:40 So killing my build time.

00:44:42 Exactly. Yeah. Right. It's like really ruins your flow. So one thing I've done, actually,

00:44:48 what I did is when writing trio itself, I said, okay, I really want trio's own test suite to run

00:44:52 really quickly. I figured that'll force me to like come up with the tools that my users will need to

00:44:57 make their test suite run quickly. Yeah.

00:44:58 So if you just type pytest trio, you know, if you want to contribute to trio, we'd love to have

00:45:03 you. We're very friendly and all that. If you type pytest trio, it runs in like five seconds.

00:45:07 It has like 99 point something percent test coverage, which is like completely, it's very

00:45:12 difficult to get there because trio is this really complicated sort of networking library. It's all

00:45:16 this stuff that's usually hard to test. Part of that is that for all the timeout tests,

00:45:21 we have this magic clock. And so the way it works is you say, okay, trio, I don't want you to use,

00:45:26 I know it says like sleep 30 seconds or whatever. I don't want you to actually use sleep 30 real

00:45:31 seconds. I only want you, I want you to sleep 30 virtual seconds. And so it's a special thing you

00:45:36 sort of pass the tree at our run to say, every time you have timeouts, sleeping, anything inside this call,

00:45:41 I want you to sort of use this virtual clock instead. And the way the virtual clock works,

00:45:45 it starts out at time zero and it just stays there. And you can like advance it manually if you

00:45:50 want or things like that. But normally what you do is you just use the automatic behavior,

00:45:54 which is, it's just, it's, it's at time zero. And then it sort of watches what your program is

00:45:59 doing. Anytime that your program sort of like finishes running everything and just stops and

00:46:04 is waiting for stuff to happen, then it looks to see, okay, looks like the next thing that would

00:46:08 wake up, there's like a sleep 10 and sleep 20. Okay. So in 10 seconds, that's the next one that'll wake

00:46:13 up. I'm just going to jump the clock forward 10 seconds and then start running again. Right.

00:46:17 So anytime it knows it's going to be waiting for a certain amount, it's like, all right,

00:46:21 we'll just, we'll let the wait start and then we'll just go right past that.

00:46:24 So it's basically, yeah, you just write your test the way you normally would with like for use timeouts

00:46:29 regularly, test your real code, but sleeps, whatever is easiest. And then what's annoying about that

00:46:34 normally is then your, your test takes like 30 seconds, a minute, whatever it is to run. Most of

00:46:39 which the time is just sitting there doing nothing, waiting for time to pass. So if you flip the switch to

00:46:44 use the special clock, then it does this exactly the same things, but it just skips over all those

00:46:48 times when it's sitting doing nothing. And so suddenly your test runs in like a few milliseconds.

00:46:52 Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. It's pretty awesome. And then it tests trio is hooked up to that.

00:46:57 So you can just turn this on with just like flip a switch on any test.

00:47:00 Oh, that's great. Yeah. So one of the things that makes me a little bit sad about Python's async

00:47:07 loops and stuff is like the asyncio based apps and the trio based apps. Those are not exactly the same

00:47:16 and they're not exactly compatible. It's not like the core you're using the same core. And so it just

00:47:22 keeps running like the asyncio loop and the trio loop. These are not the same. They got to be like

00:47:26 brought together with different APIs. Right. Yeah.

00:47:30 But you seem to have, you do have some interoperability. So like trio can work with

00:47:35 libraries that maybe assume asyncio is there or something, right?

00:47:38 Trio itself is just like a totally different library than asyncio. I've looked at, you know,

00:47:43 could I build it on top of asyncio? And there's sort of a number of reasons why that didn't sort of

00:47:47 make sense. And yes, and there is this big problem because it's just because of technical things about

00:47:55 how these async concurrency systems work. There has to be like one library ultimately that controls

00:48:00 all the actual networking like asyncio or trio or whatever, or twisted or tornado or something.

00:48:06 And that means to like, if you have a, like a say an HTTP client that's written to work on async

00:48:11 IO, it will necessarily work on trio because it's using a different set of networking primitives underneath

00:48:16 or vice versa. And this is sort of a, a larger sort of ecosystem problem, right? So there used to be,

00:48:24 there's twisted and tornado and G event and they all, none of them could interoperate. You'd have to

00:48:28 like pick which one they're using. And asyncio was sort of one of the reasons it exists is to try

00:48:33 and solve that problem and become the standard one, but then twisted and tornado and everyone can use.

00:48:38 And now they can all work on top of asyncio. And now all those libraries written for twisted and tornado,

00:48:43 you can mix and match however you like. And then here comes trio and kind of ruins that

00:48:48 by being here's this new thing you should use. So to try and kind of mitigate that,

00:48:53 there is this library called a trio asyncio, which lets you use asyncio libraries on top of trio.

00:49:00 The way it does this is kind of, it creates like a virtual asyncio loop that internally uses trios primitives

00:49:06 under the cover. And it kind of lets you, you know, kind of cordon them off and kind of a little container,

00:49:11 sort of all the weird stuff they sink IO can do. You can do that stuff, but, the kind of in a little box

00:49:17 that won't like leak out to pollute the rest of your program, your trio program.

00:49:22 I think this is really encouraging because that means if you maybe have already invested in AC IO and

00:49:27 you've already got some code written on it, like you could still Yeah.

00:49:30 Trio without going, I'm rewriting trio. And is that worth it? Is that a good idea?

00:49:34 Yeah. Or again, it gives you sort of an incremental path. You can say like, well, okay, I can at least

00:49:40 get it running on trio first of all, and then I can start porting one piece at a time and eventually

00:49:44 end up all in trio. Hopefully.

00:49:46 Exactly.

00:49:47 Exactly.

00:49:47 Now, the reason it's not, you can't just magically make this all work because

00:49:51 trio and Cinco really have fundamentally different ideas about things. Now, obviously, I think trio's

00:49:56 ideas are better. They're kind of the new thing that I try to fix all these problems, but it's not that

00:50:02 it's the differences aren't just like in terms of the internal implementation. The differences are in

00:50:06 terms of just like the fundamental concepts that are exposed.

00:50:09 Right. Like the philosophy of it.

00:50:10 Yeah. Right. It totally changes how you write the library on top.

00:50:14 Right. So it's not something you can just sort of magically switch.

00:50:17 But there's a little bit of an incremental aspect to it. So we're almost out of time.

00:50:22 Right.

00:50:22 Just really quickly, what's the future of trio? Like where is it going? What you got planned?

00:50:27 And is it production ready?

00:50:29 So yeah. So I should be clear. Yeah. Right now, the trio library itself is very solid,

00:50:33 but there is not much of an ecosystem around it. So like there is not currently an HTTP client or

00:50:39 an HTTP server that you can just use out of the box and it's like mature and all that

00:50:43 for trio. There are some solutions for these kinds of issues. And I don't want to say too

00:50:47 much because, you know, this will change quickly. We have a chat channel. If you go to our

00:50:51 documentation or whatever, you can like find out what the latest news is about what you should use.

00:50:57 But it's not something that, you know, is ready today to run big websites or something like that.

00:51:01 Okay.

00:51:02 Just because the libraries aren't there yet. If you'd like to help, you know, write those libraries and

00:51:05 make it happen. I'd love to have you. We have a really solid contributing policy and things like

00:51:11 that. You can check it out. The other thing that's happening is asyncio. So I also, I spent a lot of

00:51:17 time. I am a core Python developer. I talked to Yuri Selvanov as the main asyncio developer and Guido

00:51:22 about all this stuff. And so there is this, Yuri is quite keen on saying, oh, well, right. You know,

00:51:27 trios ideas are better. We should add them all into I sync IO. This is quite complicated. There's a lot

00:51:32 of, I mean, we could probably do a whole other podcast about all the trade offs there. And maybe

00:51:36 we should, I don't know. It's pretty interesting. It is interesting.

00:51:38 Maybe relevant. So that's something that's also happening is that Yuri is going to be trying to

00:51:42 add nurseries and cancel scopes and things to I sync IO. So I think there's a lot going to be a lot of

00:51:47 limitations. It's a lot of the value in trios of things people can't do. And I sync IO has already

00:51:52 got like six layers of abstraction built in there or I don't know. It's not actually six. It's like

00:51:57 four. And they're all totally doing all the things that trio says, these are, these are things that

00:52:02 should never be done. It shouldn't be possible. So you can't, that's also, you could fix just adding

00:52:07 a new layer on top, but you know, it's still better than nothing, right? Like, you know,

00:52:11 I think it would continue to exist. So we do want to make it as good as possible.

00:52:15 By these ideas. Yeah, absolutely.

00:52:16 And ultimately we don't, I mean, maybe like no one knows for sure whether like the make a new thing

00:52:21 plus a compatibility layer, like trio, the trio, the single thing I mentioned, is that going to be

00:52:25 the best thing or is making asyncio better going to be the best thing? We'd, none of us know for

00:52:28 sure. So we are trying both versions. I will sort of see.

00:52:32 I'm super excited just to hear that that collaboration is happening. I think that's great. All right.

00:52:38 I think that we're out of time for trio. It's super interesting project. I really love what you've

00:52:42 done there. I think it's, I think it's brilliant. So, people should definitely check it out.

00:52:46 Thanks a lot.

00:52:47 Yeah, you're welcome. So quick two final questions. If you're going to write some Python code,

00:52:50 what editor do you use?

00:52:51 I use Emacs. I've been using it for 20 years. I'm stuck.

00:52:55 It's great. It's not any, I don't know that it works for other people or not just because,

00:53:00 yeah.

00:53:01 Yeah, sure. I definitely, I started on Emacs as well. And notable pipe effect.

00:53:06 Yeah. Well, trio, obviously.

00:53:07 And, pytest.strio?

00:53:10 Yeah. pytest trios, Sphinx controlled trio. There's, if you go to the, you know,

00:53:15 github.com/python-trio to see all the different projects under the trio organization. And they're

00:53:21 sort of trying to build up that ecosystem. Like I said, so.

00:53:24 Yeah. Sounds cool. Yeah. So final call to action. People are excited. They want to try trio. Maybe

00:53:28 they want to contribute to it. What do they do?

00:53:30 Yeah. So check out, start with the documentation trio.readthedocs.io. That also will give you

00:53:36 links to our chat is, sort of a place to hang out. it has our contributing docs. If you want

00:53:41 to get involved like that, we give out commitments on your first pull request acceptance. So there's

00:53:47 lots of people. Yeah, we, we want, you know, this is a project for everyone. I don't want to just be my,

00:53:52 you know, personal little thing.

00:53:53 Yeah, that sounds great. Awesome.

00:53:55 Yeah.
