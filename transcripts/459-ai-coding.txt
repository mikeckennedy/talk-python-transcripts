00:00:00 We all know that tools like ChatGPT have really empowered developers to tackle bigger problems.

00:00:07 Are you using Tailwind CSS and need a login page?

00:00:09 Try asking chat, what is the HTML for a login page with the login, username, password, and a button

00:00:16 in its own section in the center of a page?

00:00:19 It will literally give you the first pass version of it.

00:00:23 But how far can we push this?

00:00:24 Fred Toubiran may have taken it farther than most.

00:00:28 He built a functioning SaaS product with paying customers by using only ChatGPT and Python.

00:00:36 It's fascinating to hear his story and see what he's built.

00:01:48 - Brad, welcome to "Talk Python to Me." - So great to be here.

00:01:52 Thank you so much for the invitation.

00:01:55 Nice to be here.

00:01:56 - Yeah. - Yeah, it's lovely to have you.

00:01:58 We're gonna have a lot of fun talking about this app that you've built using a highly powered by AI

00:02:06 and in different ways.

00:02:07 It's both powered by AI, but also largely built with AI.

00:02:11 And I think it's gonna give people an interesting look into what is possible these days.

00:02:17 - What is possible and the journey of a middle-aged coder also maybe.

00:02:21 - That's really an interesting thing to discuss.

00:02:24 And maybe we could just start a little bit with the introduction about yourself

00:02:27 and then talk a bit about that.

00:02:28 So before we dive into talking about how you use ChatGPT to largely build this app that is a SaaS product service

00:02:37 on the internet, people pay, subscribe to, which is the dream of many people, it's awesome.

00:02:43 With AI, just tell people a bit about yourself and then we'll, I wanna talk about this journey.

00:02:48 - It's a long story because I'm turning 50 in June, 2024.

00:02:54 If you listen to this before June, 2024, I will be 49, after I will be 50.

00:02:59 So yes, that will be-

00:03:01 - You're a spring chicken.

00:03:03 I'm older than you, Fred.

00:03:05 - Oh, you're older than me.

00:03:06 Okay, cool.

00:03:07 I found someone older than me to talk to.

00:03:10 Oh, that's fine.

00:03:11 - You can still write code into your 50s.

00:03:13 Let me tell you, the keyboard still works.

00:03:15 It's amazing.

00:03:16 - And I started when I was 48, but maybe we'll get back to this later.

00:03:20 So originally my professional journey started as an interpreter, Russian, English to French.

00:03:27 So I graduated as an interpreter, so in languages.

00:03:31 And then I started being involved in music.

00:03:34 I was head of sponsorship for a big music festival in Belgium.

00:03:38 I had rock venues, live music venues for a few years.

00:03:42 And then I started being involved in tech as a head of product, head of paid acquisition

00:03:48 for a few startups.

00:03:49 I had my own startups.

00:03:50 I exited one startup in the FinTech space in the early 2000s.

00:03:55 I had a circus for two years.

00:03:57 That's quite- - A circus?

00:03:59 - That's quite an interesting story.

00:04:00 Yes, family circus with four big tents, eight tons of equipment.

00:04:05 So that was quite a story.

00:04:07 - Was this like Cirque du Soleil or was it with animals or what kind of-

00:04:11 - It was more like, I would say like Cirque du Soleil, but at a smaller, smaller scale, of course.

00:04:16 - Okay, amazing.

00:04:17 - But four tents and circus artists and actors and musicians.

00:04:23 And that was, yes, an original show, an original story.

00:04:26 I also produced rock bands.

00:04:28 Maybe I can give a shout out to one of the bands that I love, that I contributed to, The Boxer Rebellion.

00:04:34 Maybe you heard about them, The Boxer Rebellion?

00:04:36 - Yeah. - It's a British band based here in London, but with a singer from Nashville, Tennessee, Nathan Nicholson.

00:04:44 So I was involved in music, in tech, I mean, in all of those things.

00:04:48 And I think that the project that we're going to talk about is kind of a good mix between music, tech,

00:04:54 and all my passions.

00:04:56 I was also a radio DJ for you, so that's why.

00:04:58 - That's the audio side, right?

00:05:00 That kind of brings you some together in the music, I suppose, as well.

00:05:03 - Exactly. - Amazing.

00:05:04 You know, listening to you tell the story, first of all, what a diverse set of experiences.

00:05:09 That must've been really fun.

00:05:11 - It's not a career, that's the problem.

00:05:13 Unemployable. (laughs)

00:05:15 - Yeah, that's, but in terms of thinking about products and coding, I know when I experience different areas,

00:05:22 I always see like, oh, this could be way better, and that could be way better, and why is that so hard?

00:05:26 Surely we could create some software to fix these things.

00:05:29 You must've had a lot of ideas about programs you would like to see and stuff you'd like to work on.

00:05:35 - And multiple times, the solution for me was to hire people to do it.

00:05:40 I had my own startups in the past, and I always had a team of, let's say,

00:05:44 two to five developers working for me when we were doing that.

00:05:48 So I kind of understood all the structure, the architecture of the apps,

00:05:52 but I'd never really coded myself.

00:05:57 So I was always relying on other people.

00:05:59 The difference today is that I spent most of my days coding, which is quite different.

00:06:04 - Yeah, and you said you started coding when you were 48.

00:06:08 - Yes.

00:06:09 - Roughly, almost two years ago.

00:06:11 - Yes.

00:06:12 - That's awesome.

00:06:13 You know, I do hear from a lot of people, or see comments like, oh, I think I'm too old

00:06:17 to learn this, or, oh, you have to have done this when you were a kid, or maybe gotten a degree in college,

00:06:23 otherwise you're doomed.

00:06:25 You surely have an alternative viewpoint on that, given your success.

00:06:28 - I thought it would be like that also for me, because I would say I'm quite a perfectionist,

00:06:34 so if I learn something, I want to achieve something with what I learn.

00:06:39 And the problem, the issue with code for me for a long time had been that I could go through

00:06:46 the basic tutorials, the first lessons, watching some videos or reading some tutorials.

00:06:53 It was difficult for me to really achieve something meaningful, something that I could really share,

00:06:59 that could become a product, because you always end up doing the same little exercises and little tutorials,

00:07:06 and that doesn't end up anywhere.

00:07:08 - You learned how to do a loop, but then that doesn't really help you get any closer to an app, right?

00:07:12 - How to do a little to-do list or a little calculator, or something very simple, nothing that would be worth

00:07:19 sharing as a product, and especially as a paid product.

00:07:22 So I always thought, okay, if I want to build a SaaS, the only solution for me is to rely on a freelancer

00:07:29 or on an agency or on a team of people.

00:07:33 I was doing it until I discovered--

00:07:36 - That's a big risk, and it's also not that easy to hire a team to build your product,

00:07:42 when you're still trying to figure out what a product is and all these things, right?

00:07:45 - Even if you hire non-expensive developers, it has still a cost, and if you want to,

00:07:52 you know, just, if you don't want to take too much risk, and if you want to test your product to see if you have

00:07:58 product market fits, I mean, you don't want to spend 5,000, 10,000, 15,000 on a product.

00:08:03 It's difficult, and the alternative that people are most of the time advocating these days, it's no code.

00:08:10 So it's building stuff with, let's say, Bubble, which is pretty popular.

00:08:16 - Got Retool, they've been a sponsor of the show before.

00:08:20 - Retool, obviously, that's pretty nice, mostly for internal apps.

00:08:24 And also, you can just connect stuff through Zapier, through Make, formerly IntegraMAT.

00:08:30 You can achieve something, but you don't have the control on the UI, you don't really have the control exactly

00:08:37 on what's happening behind the scenes, and you don't have the flexibility that you have

00:08:42 if you really code yourself.

00:08:44 So if you can really get your hands dirty and code on your own.

00:08:47 So I use also to be a strong advocate of no code.

00:08:50 So I was using, I'm still using firstly Zapier, and then later on Make.

00:08:56 But once I discovered Python in August, September 2022, then everything changed for me,

00:09:05 because then I could really start doing my own stuff, and I started with the backend stuff,

00:09:11 with the backend scripts, for let's say to create competitive intelligence scripts,

00:09:18 things like that.

00:09:19 And I slowly moved into frontend, but first for a few months, it was mostly local scripts on my computer.

00:09:27 - That's really interesting.

00:09:28 The low code, no code stuff is super powerful.

00:09:31 I think it does make it possible for people to build apps.

00:09:35 I have a friend who built a platform a little bit on top of something that's kind of a low code thing.

00:09:41 And it's, what they're doing is really impressive.

00:09:43 And they've got lots of customers and it's going really well.

00:09:46 It's a vibrant business.

00:09:48 It's always you're beholden to whatever that platform does.

00:09:51 If the platform has downtime, you have downtime.

00:09:54 If they're changing their feature set in a way that doesn't quite line up with what you're trying to do,

00:09:59 well, that's too bad because, you know, that they've changed their direction or whatever.

00:10:04 And it's really powerful, but it's also a little bit of a risk, right?

00:10:08 To be built on top of that.

00:10:09 - A risk, yes.

00:10:10 But for me, it was even more, I would say, the arbitrage was even more about flexibility.

00:10:16 So when you code something on your own with Python, JavaScript, as I'm doing now,

00:10:22 it's faster in many cases than trying to figure out how to connect, let's say, Airtable with something else.

00:10:29 Then you've got to think about how the data is structured in Airtable, how the data has to be structured on the other side,

00:10:36 and then how to connect them together.

00:10:39 Sometimes it's easier if you just have a SQLite database or MySQL database, and then if you do your own stuff

00:10:48 on your own without trying to connect existing SAS together.

00:10:53 It was more about flexibility for me.

00:10:57 The main reason why I switched almost completely from no code to coding.

00:11:02 - That's really interesting.

00:11:03 I guess one more that would be worth considering is price.

00:11:06 Some of these low-code, no-code platforms are really powerful, but when you start to look at price

00:11:11 for a decent number of users using your app, a lot of them are built for internal use cases.

00:11:16 They're not really built for having a bunch of multi-tenant style users and so on,

00:11:21 but also they can just get real expensive real quick.

00:11:24 - Yes, because they are based usually on the amount of transactions or scenarios or zaps that can run.

00:11:32 So if you want to transfer one piece of data from one software to another one, it's one transaction.

00:11:39 If you have, let's say, 10,000 transactions per month for a certain price, then yeah,

00:11:44 you can run out of transactions pretty quickly.

00:11:46 And very quickly, you end up paying 25, 30, $40 for a pretty low amount of transactions,

00:11:56 API codes basically, between the different SAS.

00:12:00 - And if you glue them together, one tool connects to another, which connects to another,

00:12:04 then you've got to pay for kind of the traffic and the activity in all three.

00:12:08 It's not just like, well, I'm talking to my database.

00:12:10 I'm now talking to some other service that's got something going on.

00:12:14 - And the fact is also that there are a few tools that enable you to create a UI user interface

00:12:21 for your product, but you're limited to the building blocks usually that they offer, even if you can tweak them

00:12:25 with some code.

00:12:27 And it's a bit the same, I would say it's a bit also the same issue that I've experienced on WordPress,

00:12:32 let's say.

00:12:33 The problem is that if you use something like Bubble and you want to build something with it,

00:12:38 you bring to your app or the mothership, the core of the big app of Bubble as a whole,

00:12:45 when you want to build something on top of a platform like that.

00:12:49 It's a lot of things that you don't really need for your specific apps, but it has to be there

00:12:54 because the whole engine has to run.

00:12:57 That's usually what you also experience with WordPress, for instance, when you have a site on WordPress,

00:13:04 maybe sometimes or even most of the time, you don't need that big engine.

00:13:07 You could work with a static website with a few HTML, CSS, JavaScript pages, that would be much lighter.

00:13:14 There would be less code to activate to have your website up and running.

00:13:19 So in terms of performance, if you can code your own stuff, I think it's also a good reason to choose coding

00:13:27 versus no code, if you can do it.

00:13:29 - Totally agree.

00:13:29 Price, performance, control, all those things.

00:13:33 That said, you do have to understand more about the world.

00:13:37 Like one thing we were coordinating around is just like understanding web app architecture.

00:13:43 I don't know how you feel about it, but I feel like a lot of the guidance that is out there

00:13:48 is too intense.

00:13:50 There's too many moving parts.

00:13:52 Everyone thinks you need to have some kind of background worker service like celery,

00:13:57 and you need a caching layer, and you need this, and you need that.

00:14:01 And it just starts to be like, whoa, this is like running Netflix.

00:14:05 You know what I mean?

00:14:06 Whereas a lot of times what you need is a backend, a front end, and some kind of data store, and that's it.

00:14:12 And that data store, you mentioned it before, the data store can be in the early days,

00:14:16 could be SQLite, which doesn't require another server or another thing to maintain and connect and secure.

00:14:23 And it can just be a file that you back up.

00:14:25 - Exactly.

00:14:26 And you're proving out the idea, right?

00:14:28 So maybe you're coming from a place where you weren't a DevOps expert, you know, like how'd this transition go for you?

00:14:35 - When I started developing an app, for some reason I came across Flask as a solution for Python.

00:14:44 So I started developing the app on Flask.

00:14:47 And what I like about Flask is that if you compare it, let's say you use Flask,

00:14:54 and then for the pages you use HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

00:14:58 What I like is that you can deploy an app which comes from a single folder

00:15:03 and you've got everything there, your main Flask file, and then all the, let's say the sub files in Python

00:15:11 with all the business logic that you can isolate in one file or another.

00:15:15 It's one project.

00:15:17 And then you deploy the project to GitHub, and then let's say you connect GitHub to Railway.

00:15:21 I'm using Railway for my deployment.

00:15:24 So you connect GitHub to Railway.

00:15:27 And then once you update your code in PyCharm or in Visual Studio, then you have the automatic deployment to Railway.

00:15:36 But it's one project.

00:15:38 If you want to decouple completely the backend from the front end, let's say you work with something like Next.js,

00:15:45 for instance, and then you want to have a backend in something else, then you've got to have multiple instances

00:15:51 and connect them together.

00:15:52 It becomes more complicated.

00:15:54 But if you want to create something simple, you can keep it simple with one single Flask web app.

00:16:01 And that's what I've been doing so far.

00:16:03 Most of the Django maker that I built, that I've been building since September 23,

00:16:10 is a Flask web app.

00:16:11 So it's one project, one big project.

00:16:14 It's one project.

00:16:15 It's interesting that you mentioned, Celery, a few moments ago, because I'm about to ship a new app,

00:16:21 which is coming in the next two weeks or three weeks, I think.

00:16:24 And that's the first time after almost 18 months of development that I've considered using something like that

00:16:32 because I needed it for performance reasons to process something.

00:16:37 - Something you want to start off in the background and get back and just let it be done later, right?

00:16:42 Yeah.

00:16:43 - And it was not that easy.

00:16:44 We had a discussion with someone who is amazing on the Discord of Railway two, three days ago,

00:16:52 because if you're deploying things on Railway, you would usually use, and that's what they advise you to do as on Heroku,

00:17:01 a proc file.

00:17:02 And the proc file, you've got the start commands that will start your project.

00:17:07 But on Heroku, which is a competitor of Railway, you can start both the web app

00:17:13 and the worker in the same file.

00:17:17 But you can't do that on Railway.

00:17:18 You've got theoretically to have two different projects, which kind of defeats the purpose.

00:17:23 - You kind of deploy them both, right?

00:17:24 But then you get to more coordination.

00:17:27 - Yeah, but fortunately, and there is a discussion on the Discord between me and one of the guys there,

00:17:33 they had a way to create a custom JSON for me, which managed to start both the web app

00:17:40 and the worker in the same deployment.

00:17:44 But I had to fight, to be honest with you, for like four or five hours to find a solution.

00:17:49 Because sometimes the problem, and that's the issue that I've seen a lot,

00:17:53 is that traditional developers, like professional developers, not people like me, not random guys like me,

00:17:59 usually they assume that the people that they're supposed to explain things to

00:18:04 know much more than what they do.

00:18:07 And so they just write a few instructions, like cryptic instructions that nobody really understands.

00:18:16 And they would assume that everyone reading those instructions would understand

00:18:20 what they have to do to, let's say, use this worker service, for instance.

00:18:25 But that's not the case.

00:18:26 - I totally agree.

00:18:27 This portion of "Talk Python to Me" is brought to you by MailTrap, an email delivery platform that developers love.

00:18:47 Try for free at mailtrap.io.

00:18:50 You know, it's kind of the curse of knowledge.

00:18:53 Like once you know all of these things, it's really hard to remember, oh yeah, so then you just,

00:18:58 oh, just run that in Docker, and then link it and set up a network over there.

00:19:02 You're like, wait a minute.

00:19:03 - Yeah, I'll do it. - I don't know how to do that.

00:19:05 I'm just trying to run my Python app.

00:19:07 Like you're bringing a whole new thing in that you think makes it sound easy,

00:19:11 and it makes it sound real hard to me.

00:19:12 I totally agree this is a problem.

00:19:14 - So many moving pieces.

00:19:15 When you start coding, I mean, obviously you know that because you've been in this game for much longer than me,

00:19:22 but once you start coding, there are so many little things that you have to know

00:19:26 to make this thing work.

00:19:28 So it starts with how to just configure GitHub and connect it to your--

00:19:34 - How do you use Git?

00:19:35 If you have a Git conflict, you might be like, well, this is done.

00:19:38 I can't do anything else anymore.

00:19:39 It's broken. - Yeah.

00:19:41 - I mean, it's really overwhelming when you're new, right?

00:19:43 - Yeah, it's a lot.

00:19:44 And that's where AI today helps you because in most cases, if you know how to talk with the AI,

00:19:52 you will get answers that are much easier to understand than what you would have on Stack Overflow, for instance.

00:19:58 - I agree.

00:19:59 It's very interesting how helpful it is.

00:20:00 I think it's a good time to about jump into that.

00:20:02 But before we do, tell people about Railway a bit.

00:20:04 How does this work?

00:20:05 I haven't used Railways before.

00:20:07 - It's a platform where you can deploy your apps, basically.

00:20:11 It connects to your GitHub account.

00:20:16 It's not only, I mean, you have on Railway not only a possibility to deploy your Flask app

00:20:22 or other types of apps also, but they also offer all the database aspect.

00:20:29 So you can spin a Redis database.

00:20:33 You can have a MySQL database.

00:20:35 I think they also have Mongo.

00:20:37 I mean, they have most of the formats that you can expect.

00:20:40 And the great thing is that everything is on the same platform.

00:20:45 Let's say that I've got another project I'm involved with a developer, with a real developer.

00:20:50 Hi to Alex, if he listens to this podcast, a professional developer.

00:20:54 For that project, for instance, we have an app on Heroku.

00:20:59 We have a database on MongoDB Atlas, and we have the files uploaded to S3, to Amazon S3

00:21:10 for the file storage.

00:21:11 On Railway, you can, at least it's what I do, you can have at the same time, the deployment of the app,

00:21:17 so which replaces Heroku, and you can have the database also together.

00:21:22 And the cool thing is that they are, I would say even physically at the same location.

00:21:26 So in terms of performance, it's pretty easy to handle.

00:21:31 And it's very user-friendly.

00:21:32 I mean, very, very easy to use.

00:21:35 From what I saw, even easier to understand than Heroku.

00:21:39 And I tried also some things like Versal or I use for some project also,

00:21:46 but that's more for static website, Netlify.

00:21:48 But for this type-

00:21:50 - Netlify is fantastic for static, but yeah.

00:21:51 - For static, Netlify is just amazing.

00:21:53 And just the one where you can just drag and drop a project, for instance, for a static website, so easy.

00:21:59 But for a more multi-tenant dynamic web app, like the Jingle Maker, Railway was really cool.

00:22:06 And as you can see from the presentation, it's very user-friendly.

00:22:10 - It definitely is.

00:22:11 And the pricing is actually really decent.

00:22:14 They have a free trial and then $5 a month.

00:22:17 But that gets you eight gigs of RAM and eight CPUs per service.

00:22:20 That is really good.

00:22:22 - I started it on the OBI plan.

00:22:24 And I think that today, just to give you an idea, with roughly 500 users coming to the app per day,

00:22:33 and a lot of them using the product, I pay for that roughly $15 a month.

00:22:41 - Incredible.

00:22:42 - For both the app deployment and the database, which is in MySQL for the Jingle Maker.

00:22:49 - That's pretty impressive.

00:22:51 Good one to know about, this is cool.

00:22:52 - Yes, nice one.

00:22:53 - They have good Python support?

00:22:54 - Yes, yes, very good.

00:22:56 And they have, as I said, like most people do today, a Discord server monitored also by volunteers.

00:23:03 And there was a guy the other day, I didn't even know he was not part of the official team of Railway,

00:23:08 and it really helped me.

00:23:09 He wrote some code for me to make this thing work with Celery.

00:23:13 So it was really, really amazing.

00:23:15 And it was on a Sunday in the evening.

00:23:18 So really nice.

00:23:19 - Yeah, that's amazing.

00:23:20 One thing I just wanna give a shout out to that I came across recently, and that's interesting is Coolify.

00:23:25 - Coolify.

00:23:26 - Which is, it's self-hosted Heroku Netlify Vercel alternative, and you just get pushed to it.

00:23:33 I don't know if it's better than this though, because you gotta have a decent server to run it on,

00:23:38 and you gotta run the Docker stuff and whatnot to sort of do it.

00:23:42 But yeah, anyway, speaking of interesting deployments.

00:23:44 - Yeah, you're gonna manage also.

00:23:46 Because the other day, I think it was 10 days ago, there was a DDOS attack, I think, against Railway

00:23:52 for the European part of their network.

00:23:56 But they were very quick jumping on it and managing all of that and doing all the mitigation against it.

00:24:03 If you run your own service, then you've got to take care of all of that

00:24:07 on your own security and all of that.

00:24:09 - There's benefits, but there's also drawbacks there.

00:24:12 All right, let's talk about, I think the right way to start talking about this,

00:24:17 how you're using AI and the journey you went through.

00:24:20 I mean, we've talked a lot about foundations already, but let's talk about your app.

00:24:24 You mentioned a couple of times AI Jingle Maker.

00:24:27 Tell people what it does.

00:24:28 - It's a web app that you can find on AIJingleMaker.com.

00:24:31 And if you enter the app, you can create your own sweepers, radio jingles,

00:24:38 podcast intros, audio promos, as if you were playing with Lego bricks, I would say.

00:24:44 It's not the usual DOE experience.

00:24:48 If you'll be using things like GarageBand or FL Studio or Pro Tools to edit your audio,

00:24:56 you can imagine those waves that you've got to move around to create your jingles or your sweepers.

00:25:03 If you're using, for instance, the open source Audacity software also on your computer,

00:25:08 you can do that.

00:25:09 But still, you've got to know how to move these things around and how to play with the volume, the fade in, the fade out,

00:25:17 the reverb, the chorus, the flanger, I mean, all the effects.

00:25:21 And I mean, it's not that easy for many people.

00:25:24 And so I thought that I could build something that made it as easy as pressing on a few buttons.

00:25:31 That's the idea of the product.

00:25:34 So the way you use it when you enter the product, you've got four different parts.

00:25:41 You've got the intro, the background, the outro, and the voiceover, which is on top of the background.

00:25:47 And the voiceover, you've got, now you've got three different options.

00:25:51 You've got the possibility to record your own voice.

00:25:53 So I rebuilt a voice recorder, an online voice recorder, where you can quickly record your voice,

00:26:00 add a few effects, and then, boom, use that as your voiceover.

00:26:04 You can also upload an existing recording that you have on your computer.

00:26:08 So if you've got something that you recorded with FL Studio or something else,

00:26:12 you can upload it and use it as a voiceover.

00:26:15 Or you can use AI.

00:26:17 So I'm connected to a bunch of text-to-speech API.

00:26:21 So I didn't develop the models myself.

00:26:23 I'm not someone smart enough to develop a foundational model, but I'm connected to the APIs,

00:26:29 and you can pick one of the voices.

00:26:32 You can write your text, generate the voiceover, and once you have the voiceover, you just select it.

00:26:38 And when you have the voiceover, you choose a background behind it.

00:26:41 So let's say groovy music, house music, rock music, romantic music, whatever.

00:26:47 You've got some pre-made sounds in the app.

00:26:51 You choose an intro, an outro, and then you press on generate jingle.

00:26:55 And in five seconds, you've got the jingle.

00:26:57 That's basically the idea.

00:26:59 - I'll put in the jingle so people know exactly what this sounds like.

00:27:04 I'll put it in right now.

00:27:05 (electronic music)

00:27:06 - Party time!

00:27:07 This is Martin Superstar, your number one favorite DJ in New York City.

00:27:11 - It's really cool, and it's something that I've seen people hire voiceover actors

00:27:19 on like Fiverr and stuff like that.

00:27:22 They'll maybe pay 30 bucks to have somebody do a couple of trials and throw some music on top of,

00:27:27 or something like that, right?

00:27:29 - And I'm a voiceover artist on Fiverr.

00:27:31 I'm doing that also.

00:27:32 So I know exactly what it is.

00:27:34 - Let me see if I can automate my job away.

00:27:36 - It was not really the idea of automating completely a job away.

00:27:40 It was more like the, how can you create something that's self-service and that can meet the needs of people,

00:27:47 as you said, who don't want to spend 50 bucks or 100 bucks for something,

00:27:51 but who want to have an easy way to create basic sweepers, jingles, or some other things.

00:27:58 And the first target was mostly indie radio stations or small podcasts.

00:28:06 But then I saw many brands coming, like I wouldn't say, like not the big brands,

00:28:12 but small brands coming, like apparel brands or coffee shops, or I had the other day,

00:28:19 a bar in Ibiza signing up and paying for credits to generate a promo for the bar in Ibiza.

00:28:27 So yeah, it's not only radio stations and podcasts.

00:28:31 It's also anyone who wants to create a promo for their business.

00:28:36 So that's also one of the services.

00:28:39 And when I started, it was only short sweepers, jingles, radio station IDs, stuff like that.

00:28:45 But then I added something which is called the promo maker, which you have in the jingle maker,

00:28:51 where you can create something which is up to 30 seconds long.

00:28:54 So more like a radio ad.

00:28:55 That's an, and there you can also use AI.

00:28:58 It's connected to open AI, to be honest, but you can also use AI to generate the text of your promo.

00:29:04 So just put the name of your business, what you're selling, your service, your product.

00:29:08 Then it will suggest the text.

00:29:10 Then you choose the voice, generate the AI voice, and then you add the sounds and then it's finished.

00:29:16 So let's say in 20 seconds, you've got a note you add.

00:29:19 So that's the promise or the promo maker.

00:29:22 - It's a cool app and it's really impressive to look at this and think that you built this

00:29:27 with less than a year of Python or really any coding experience, right?

00:29:31 Roughly that amount?

00:29:32 - To put things really in perspective so that people know what they can expect

00:29:37 if they start their coding journey.

00:29:41 So I started coding in Python in September, September, October, 2022.

00:29:48 For a few months, as I said, I was mostly coding scripts on my computer that helped me in my daily business

00:29:54 because I didn't tell you in the beginning, but most of my activity, it's online marketing.

00:29:59 It's working for startups and bigger companies also.

00:30:02 So I need scripts, you know, to, for competitive intelligence, for SEO, for even content production, this type of thing.

00:30:10 So I created a lot of scripts locally on my computer before considering the front end part.

00:30:17 Then that's when I discovered Flask.

00:30:19 That was just before the summer of 2023.

00:30:23 And yes, the first version of the Jingle Maker that I launched, it was just on the home page.

00:30:29 You couldn't basically tweak anything.

00:30:32 There were just four different jingles and just put the name of your radio station.

00:30:37 You press on generate and it generated one thing, the same for everyone.

00:30:41 And it started getting some traction between May, 2023 and August.

00:30:46 And then I said, okay, I'm gonna really dive into this project and develop something more sophisticated.

00:30:53 I started working on that on a Monday in September.

00:30:58 It was released on the Friday, the V2.

00:31:00 - And I gotta tell you, your website now looks really nice.

00:31:05 You've done a lot of good design work on it as well in the last couple of months.

00:31:09 - Yeah, it has evolved because maybe you saw it for the first time when we decided to do this podcast.

00:31:15 It was a white page.

00:31:17 The logo was the same, but it was different.

00:31:19 Originally, it was only in material design.

00:31:22 I was using material design via the CDN from Google.

00:31:27 But then I wanted to use Tailwind.

00:31:30 The new version that you see is using Tailwind.

00:31:33 So people might recognize the Tailwind vibe.

00:31:37 And I worked quite a lot on this thing that, okay, we said it's audio, so people don't see it.

00:31:42 But if you go on the website, you will see it.

00:31:44 There is this rotating list of things that you can create with the product.

00:31:51 It was inspired by some code that I found, but I had to retweak it for, you know,

00:31:55 make it responsive and all of that.

00:31:58 And you know, also a big shout out to my son, who is 18, you know, is learning Python a lot.

00:32:03 He coded a few things recently.

00:32:06 He's coding something to play darts at the moment, like to calculate the scores in darts.

00:32:11 And two months ago, he said to me that, "Your site is nice, but it looks ugly.

00:32:18 So could you make something that looks better?" I said, "Yeah, yeah, but you know, I kind of like it."

00:32:25 I said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that.

00:32:27 It's not the way it should be.

00:32:29 So do something better.

00:32:30 I know you can do it." So that's why also we've got something which looks better today, thanks to my son, Maxim.

00:32:37 - It's a huge improvement from where it started.

00:32:40 So nice work on that.

00:32:41 All right, let's talk about some of the techniques that you used here to, first of all,

00:32:46 what LLM did you use to go on this journey?

00:32:49 - When I started, I wasn't even aware of GitHub Copilot.

00:32:52 So I started only with the ChatGPT.

00:32:55 I was an early premium user of ChatGPT.

00:32:59 So I started paying the 20 bucks very, very early for GPT+.

00:33:03 So I started using ChatGPT.

00:33:05 So basically switching between the ChatGPT UI and the IDE.

00:33:10 I started using PyCharm.

00:33:14 So that's the first one I used.

00:33:15 So I was creating some code in ChatGPT and then jumping to PyCharm, test the code.

00:33:23 And then if there was a bug, coming back to ChatGPT.

00:33:25 So this back and forth journey.

00:33:26 - You asked it at the beginning.

00:33:28 How do I make a Flask app?

00:33:29 Or what did you ask it in the beginning?

00:33:31 Like, how do I make a Flask app?

00:33:33 How do I make a Flask app that does audio?

00:33:36 Like, what did you?

00:33:37 - I knew that I wanted to use Flask.

00:33:40 So the first thing that you would ask is to ask a ChatGPT for a boilerplate of a Flask web app.

00:33:46 And it will give you pretty quickly the basic building blocks.

00:33:51 I don't know if it would give you straight away the architecture with a template

00:33:56 inside of the templates folder, but no, it gives you here.

00:34:00 - Hello world.

00:34:01 - Yeah, bring on hello world on the page.

00:34:03 But then if you know that you need HTML, then you will ask a ChatGPT to tweak it

00:34:09 to render index.html from the templates folder.

00:34:14 And there you see, there it starts.

00:34:17 And it gives you some boilerplate for the HTML that you put in the templates folder.

00:34:21 And then you learn that you need, ideally to have some JavaScript in a JavaScript file

00:34:29 and that you need some CSS in a CSS file.

00:34:32 And that those two files will be in the static folder of a Flask web app.

00:34:37 So now I've got, let's say my routine, I've got all of that ready.

00:34:41 And if I start a new app, I don't even need, obviously, a ChatGPT.

00:34:46 I just create my structure.

00:34:48 I put index.html, script.js, styles.css.

00:34:53 But then what you can also ask ChatGPT to do, for instance, is if you've got your HTML page,

00:35:00 you can say, "Restyle this HTML page "with Tailwind CSS using the CDN," for instance,

00:35:06 and it will give you a full restyling.

00:35:08 And then you can ask it, "Okay, I want on this page four buttons, "and those four buttons should do X, Y, Z."

00:35:16 And then you start moving into the JavaScript part of it for the interactions on the page.

00:35:24 And the interesting thing maybe, which would explain also why I haven't really started

00:35:30 using Next.js or Vue or things like that, is that by default, for some reason,

00:35:36 you've got to ask OpenAI why, maybe because of some legacy importance of vanilla JavaScript.

00:35:42 But if you ask ChatGPT to start creating some interactions on an HTML page, it won't just tell you,

00:35:50 "Okay, you know, these days people use React "or Next.js or something like that,

00:35:55 "so maybe you could, or you should consider that." It will go deep into vanilla JavaScript.

00:36:01 And after developing the Jingle Maker for a few months, I showed it to my friend Alex,

00:36:07 who is this developer I was talking about earlier, who has graduated, I would say,

00:36:12 from vanilla JavaScript to React, and he looked at my code and said, "Man, that's crazy.

00:36:17 "It's all vanilla JavaScript.

00:36:19 "There's not a single line of React.

00:36:21 "So everything in your app, "it's lines and lines and lines of JavaScript."

00:36:26 - That's a benefit and a drawback.

00:36:29 - He said that he would not even be able to write it this way from scratch today.

00:36:34 That's not something that he would really consider doing because it's more verbose,

00:36:39 there's more stuff to write to achieve what you want to achieve.

00:36:43 But the thing is that with ChatGPT or today with a GitHub copilot embedded in the IDE,

00:36:50 even if it's longer, that's not a problem because you don't write a single line of code.

00:36:55 I think it's important to point that out is that in the Jingle Maker, there is not one single line of code that I wrote, not one.

00:37:03 - That's insane.

00:37:04 - There's not a single line of code that I typed from the first curly bracket to the last curly bracket.

00:37:11 Nothing.

00:37:12 Everything is written like that.

00:37:14 Yesterday, for instance, I was working on something completely different now

00:37:18 for a friend who is also a client who are working on a Gmail add-on.

00:37:22 So I don't know if you're familiar with that, but you're using Apps Script from Google

00:37:28 and then create a manifest and blah, blah.

00:37:32 And I didn't know anything about Gmail add-ons until yesterday in the morning.

00:37:37 And after now five hours of work, we've got a fully working product in Gmail.

00:37:43 - That's amazing.

00:37:44 - That's crazy, 2024.

00:37:46 And it's only the beginning.

00:37:47 I really see that evolving super fast.

00:37:51 I think that now the most important thing is to be able to talk to the machine,

00:37:56 to explain the structure, the architecture of what you expect, and to be clear in your head

00:38:03 about the code has to be developed for the pages to interact, for the elements to interact together.

00:38:10 And if it's clear in your head, and if you can explain it clearly to the LLM,

00:38:15 it's just magic.

00:38:17 - It is like magic.

00:38:17 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:38:18 It's pretty wild.

00:38:19 If you're a regular listener of the podcast, you surely heard about Talk Python's online courses,

00:38:26 but have you had a chance to try them out?

00:38:28 No matter the level you're looking for, we have a course for you.

00:38:31 Our Python for Absolute Beginners is like an introduction to Python, plus that first year computer science course

00:38:36 that you never took.

00:38:37 Our data-driven web app courses build a full pypi.org clone along with you right on the screen.

00:38:44 And we even have a few courses to dip your toe in with.

00:38:47 See what we have to offer at training.talkpython.fm, or just click the link in your podcast player.

00:38:52 So you can see on the side here, I have these really weird recent chats I had,

00:38:58 like a skilled baker Q&A and survive a plane crash in the wilderness.

00:39:03 And so these things are actually related.

00:39:04 And what I was trying to do was I was trying to understand how much prompt engineering

00:39:10 and sort of setting the stage for the questions matters.

00:39:14 So like this one, I said, you are a very skilled baker.

00:39:18 You have run a successful restaurant in the city for five years.

00:39:21 Now I will ask you questions.

00:39:23 As opposed to this one, you are a very skilled outdoorsman and you've been on multiple reality shows.

00:39:29 Now I'll ask you some questions.

00:39:30 And they were both the same question.

00:39:32 If I'm in a plane crash and I need to survive, what do I, I wanted to see how much like the baker

00:39:37 would focus on food and stuff versus the survivalist on others.

00:39:41 And I feel like, you know, that's a real clear way to understand this kind of stuff

00:39:46 in just a real general way.

00:39:48 But I think there must be a code aspect of that as well.

00:39:52 Like rather than just tell me how to do this in Python, like you have written this app in Python

00:39:58 or you're an expert on FastAPI.

00:40:00 Now I want to talk to you.

00:40:01 You may get different results, maybe better, maybe worse, I don't know.

00:40:04 But did you try any of this techniques or was it just straight down the middle?

00:40:08 Tell me how to do this with Tailwind.

00:40:10 - To be fair with you, because I was a total newbie in the beginning, I was making sure to ask the AI to explain to me

00:40:18 almost as if I were a five-year-old, you know?

00:40:22 - Yeah.

00:40:22 - Because I could have told the AI, you're an expert Python developer and then just give me the code.

00:40:31 But then I don't have all the explanations because then it behaves like an expert Python developer.

00:40:37 And there are many shortcuts that it will take and not really give you all the details,

00:40:43 documenting all the code.

00:40:44 So I'm still more like in a, explain to me in layman's terms, you know?

00:40:50 - Yeah.

00:40:51 - How to do this.

00:40:52 Because then also I understand the code.

00:40:54 So it's easier for me to debug it.

00:40:57 I usually take the analogy that when you said that sometimes you think it might be too late

00:41:02 to learn to code or to learn to do something.

00:41:05 Let's say that you want to learn to play music, to play the piano.

00:41:08 At a certain age, it becomes very difficult because you don't have the reflex, the muscles,

00:41:13 agility that you can have when you are a young kid to learn how to play the piano.

00:41:18 But still you could understand what's on the score written on the page from the music.

00:41:23 So in coding for me, it's kind of the same.

00:41:26 I would, to be honest with you, I would not be able to write most of the code

00:41:30 that is in my app myself, but I can read the score and I can see the connections

00:41:37 between the different building blocks in the code.

00:41:40 So I can understand if there's a problem, you know, a syntax issue, because there's some, you know, closing brackets

00:41:47 that are not properly closed.

00:41:48 I can see it.

00:41:50 I wouldn't be able to write the code properly in the first place myself.

00:41:55 You could argue it's a problem, but I say, you know, for me, the output is what matters.

00:42:01 It's the final product, which is what matters.

00:42:04 So as long as I understand what's on the screen, for me, it's okay.

00:42:08 - Yeah, well, let's loop it back to the original way we started this.

00:42:11 One way you could do this is you could hire people to build this for you, and then they give you the code

00:42:16 and you're in the same position.

00:42:17 Like here's a huge pile of code and you probably understand it.

00:42:20 I'm sure you understand it less well than if you went through step by step and built,

00:42:25 100% sure.

00:42:26 - I was in that position a few times where I was involved in some projects

00:42:31 and I was not involved in the actual coding of the project.

00:42:35 And then I inherited the project.

00:42:39 I mean, I had the code base, but I could, I mean, I could just put it on a shelf

00:42:42 because I would not be able to do anything with that.

00:42:46 Whereas now I understand every single section of what's written in the app.

00:42:51 So at the moment I'm repurposing some of the payment logic because I will switch from Stripe to Paddle

00:42:57 in the IJINGL maker.

00:42:59 And yeah, so I've got to rebuild the payment models.

00:43:02 I've got to rebuild the Flask route for the API endpoints for the payment confirmations and all of that.

00:43:09 So I know where they are and I know what they do.

00:43:12 So I know how to tweak them and I can highlight exactly what I want.

00:43:17 And then now I'm using, I would say 75% of the time I'm using GitHub Copilot straight in the IDE directly

00:43:24 because it's in context then.

00:43:25 You highlight the code and then if the suggestion is nice you just insert it to replace the code.

00:43:33 So yeah, once you've got something that you understand it goes faster and faster.

00:43:39 - Yeah, and you're still early in this project, right?

00:43:41 This is- - Yeah, super early.

00:43:42 - Five, six months or something.

00:43:44 - Like a baby.

00:43:45 - Yes, I imagine as you do more of this you might not choose to write a lot of code

00:43:49 but I bet you'll start to be able to write code kind of like language immersion.

00:43:53 You know, if you move to Brazil you would start to learn Portuguese.

00:43:57 - Yes.

00:43:58 - Eventually just 'cause you're in that environment so much, you know?

00:44:00 - But sometimes really, you know, with the suggestions it's, you wouldn't see why you would write the code.

00:44:09 For instance, I had earlier today I was creating a scraper to check the technology used

00:44:15 by different websites by looking in the source code for let's say WP for WordPress,

00:44:21 Odoo for Odoo, Squarespace, Weebly, you know, this kind of thing.

00:44:24 We just wrote together with the AI the first part and then we had to replicate the code

00:44:30 in beautiful soup for the scraper for each of them.

00:44:35 There's absolutely no reason why I would write each iteration.

00:44:39 And once you write two of them, then you with Copilot, you just go with your tab

00:44:46 to the next section and we understand that what you expect because you've got like three or four different technologies

00:44:53 that you want to track in your code that you declared before, they would have to write a block of six lines.

00:44:59 Boom, that's the block of six lines.

00:45:01 There's no reason in the world why I would write those six lines, you know?

00:45:05 - Amazing.

00:45:06 - That's crazy, that's crazy.

00:45:07 - One more prompt in engineering thing and you talked about it and I think it is a problem.

00:45:11 So I asked basically what's the boiler plate and it said, boom, here's the boiler plate

00:45:16 for Flask and ChatGPT.

00:45:18 Then I said, well, how do I use a template?

00:45:19 And it said, boom, here's the two pieces of code.

00:45:22 And you said, sometimes this can be really challenging.

00:45:25 You said one of the techniques used was to explain to me like a five-year-old.

00:45:28 Another thing that works really well is I just said, tell me this again, let's think step by step.

00:45:34 And it gave me a 10 step process.

00:45:37 Start one, install Flask, create a project directory, create the project script, import Flask.

00:45:42 And it was really much more like this is what each step you need to do.

00:45:47 And things like that are really neat.

00:45:49 When you really start learning, it's nice to do it step by step because some people they don't understand

00:45:54 and that's quite normal.

00:45:56 I would say that you've got to install those libraries before using them, simple things like that.

00:46:04 So in the beginning, it's nice to go step by step.

00:46:08 - It's really powerful.

00:46:08 And it's something people can check out.

00:46:11 There's a cool video, that's your channel, this one.

00:46:15 - Yeah.

00:46:16 - Prompt Engineering 101 by Patrick LeVere.

00:46:18 And yeah, it's like a 14 minute video, talks to you, has a bunch of advice

00:46:22 from places like Anthropic and others.

00:46:24 And like, here is how you go and some things you can try.

00:46:27 - It's also evolving.

00:46:29 Thanks also to the longer context windows that we have today in DLLM.

00:46:34 Because when I started doing that in 2022, the context window was maximum 4,000 tokens

00:46:43 or something like that.

00:46:44 So you had to really go by short section.

00:46:47 It was very difficult to debug long pieces of code, long sections of code.

00:46:52 Now the token window is 128,000 on OpenAI and even longer on Cloud or other LLMs.

00:47:01 Today it's possible to basically throw at some point 750 lines of code in a 1,000 lines of code in DLLM

00:47:10 and get some refactoring, debugging.

00:47:14 That's also really amazing.

00:47:15 When you need, let's say, you know that you created something cool in one app, some business logic,

00:47:21 something interesting, but you know that you want to just repurpose it in a small way,

00:47:26 like make little tweaks.

00:47:27 You just throw all the code into DLLM and you just explain the little changes that you want

00:47:33 and it will give you the adapted code fully functional in one go, one shot, which is also impressive.

00:47:40 - That is super impressive.

00:47:41 So it sounds like you use Google Copilot a lot.

00:47:43 Have you looked at GPT Engineer?

00:47:45 - Nope.

00:47:46 - So I haven't really either, but it basically, it's supposed to be kind of an iterative thing that goes,

00:47:52 it will generate all the multiple files for you and then like try to understand how all those pieces

00:47:59 fit together and work.

00:48:00 And so-

00:48:01 - More like an agent logic.

00:48:03 - Yeah, exactly, exactly.

00:48:05 So, but pretty.

00:48:07 - I started working with the GPTs from OpenAI, from ChatGPT.

00:48:11 I created a few of them.

00:48:13 It was a funny one, for instance, I'm working for an accounting firm for some marketing

00:48:18 and the boss of the company sent me a document of 350 pages explaining the accounting module on Odu,

00:48:27 which is a ERP system two weeks ago.

00:48:30 And he said, "Oh, you should read that "to be able to understand it "and answer questions about the module."

00:48:35 And I just threw it into ChatGPT, uploaded the PDF and I created a custom GPT.

00:48:41 So now I can ask the custom GPT questions about the accounting module.

00:48:46 So-

00:48:46 - Oh, that's insane.

00:48:47 - Instead of reading the...

00:48:49 And also another nice use case that I have, it's nothing about coding, but sometimes you're just on YouTube

00:48:57 and someone tells you, this is the five big important things you have to know in 2024,

00:49:03 which would change your life forever.

00:49:05 So I'm tempted, maybe I will watch this video because it might be interesting.

00:49:10 But I'm gonna say, no, it's probably not that interesting.

00:49:13 It's probably a lot of fluff.

00:49:14 So now usually what I do is that I've got a website called, I don't remember the name, sorry,

00:49:20 but one of the websites where you can get the transcript of a video.

00:49:26 So I go get the transcript, throw it into ChatGPT.

00:49:29 And then I ask, what are the five important things I should know that would change my life forever in 24?

00:49:36 And then I've got them in five seconds.

00:49:37 I don't need to watch a 35 minutes video.

00:49:40 - And then maybe you decide to watch it later.

00:49:42 - Maybe, maybe.

00:49:43 - You can filter it, right?

00:49:44 Yeah, awesome.

00:49:46 What an interesting story, Fred.

00:49:47 I think maybe we should wrap it up, but people can check out AIjinglemaker.com.

00:49:52 I'll put that in the show notes.

00:49:53 There's two other things from you that are noteworthy.

00:49:57 One is you have your AI Coding Club newsletter.

00:49:59 Do you wanna tell people about that?

00:50:00 - Yeah, that's a newsletter I started, which is connected to some of the videos

00:50:04 I posted on YouTube, where I would explain to people how to use AI for coding purposes.

00:50:11 I will start sending the newsletters soon, actually.

00:50:13 I started registering people, but I haven't sent the first edition yet, but I will start very soon.

00:50:20 I've got also a new app, as I said, coming up, probably within two weeks.

00:50:24 It will be called the AI Showmaker.

00:50:26 It's a way to create a podcast or a radio show with building blocks.

00:50:31 So it's the same concept as the Jinglemaker, but for longer form.

00:50:35 - That sounds really interesting.

00:50:36 All right, cool.

00:50:37 People can check it out here.

00:50:38 And by the way, I've been thinking a lot about email and newsletters and stuff.

00:50:42 I was doing a bunch with MailChimp for many, many years, and it's just got to be super, super expensive,

00:50:49 and I got frustrated with them.

00:50:50 So did a bunch of research on different platforms, looked at buttondown.email,

00:50:56 and actually chose ListMonk, which is self-hosted and Docker style thing.

00:51:01 But one of the ones that I came across at the end is Beehive, which looks pretty interesting.

00:51:06 Are you happy with Beehive?

00:51:07 - It's more competing with Substack.

00:51:08 I think it was co-created by one of the guys who co-founded Morning Brew, the newsletter Morning Brew.

00:51:15 So he knows what he's talking about.

00:51:17 And it's really, also really well coded, really well executed.

00:51:22 It's a pleasure to use.

00:51:24 And you can use it for free for up to 2,500 subscribers.

00:51:29 Yeah, that's it.

00:51:30 So yeah, it's a good one.

00:51:31 - The pricing is way, way better than things like MailChimp and stuff.

00:51:36 So it's nice.

00:51:37 Also cheaper than Substack.

00:51:41 So I don't know which cut they take from the subscription if you run a premium newsletter,

00:51:47 but it's much cheaper than Substack.

00:51:49 I think Substack takes 10% from like Patreon and other platform like that.

00:51:55 - Nice.

00:51:55 All right, and then one other thing is your, call me Fred.

00:52:00 - YouTube channel, yeah.

00:52:01 I've got some videos there.

00:52:03 Some of the videos are explaining how to use the Jingle Maker, the recent ones,

00:52:07 but also some of them are about this journey of how to code with AI.

00:52:14 There are some concrete examples also, like I coded recently a Chrome extension,

00:52:20 a bookmarking Chrome extension, all the code.

00:52:23 The explanations is on YouTube and the code on GitHub.

00:52:27 So I've got different projects like that.

00:52:29 And yeah, I'm usually documenting what I do on YouTube.

00:52:33 - Yeah, nice.

00:52:34 So people can check that out.

00:52:35 All right.

00:52:36 Well, I think that about does it for the time that we got together, but thanks for coming on and sharing your story.

00:52:42 I think it'll inspire a lot of folks.

00:52:43 - Thank you.

00:52:44 I hope that everything was clear, that I wasn't cursed to be too cryptic,

00:52:49 like the developers I was talking about, but yeah, so it's really exciting.

00:52:55 It's rejuvenating, as you could say.

00:52:59 - It's opening up a whole world of possibilities, right?

00:53:01 - I wish I would have started earlier, to be honest, because when I see my son, he's 18,

00:53:06 and what he already does today with Python, that's quite amazing.

00:53:13 So when you're 18, imagine where you will be when you will be 48 or 49.

00:53:19 It will be like really good.

00:53:21 So yeah, that's the beauty.

00:53:23 That's the beauty of it.

00:53:24 So don't wait too long if you're young, if you're listening to the podcast,

00:53:28 start today or yesterday even.

00:53:30 - Yeah. - It's amazing.

00:53:30 - Awesome.

00:53:31 Well, totally agree.

00:53:32 Thanks so much for being here.

00:53:34 And see you later.

00:53:35 - Thank you so much.
