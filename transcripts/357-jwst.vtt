00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.100
Telescopes have been fundamental in our understanding of our place in the universe.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.900
And when you think about images that have shaped our modern view of space,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.720
you probably think about Hubble.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.260
But just this year, the JWST or James Webb Space Telescope was launched.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.980
JWST will go far beyond what Hubble has discovered.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.600
And did you know that Python is used extensively in the whole data pipeline of JWST?

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.280
We have two great guests here to tell us all about it, Megan Soze and Mike Swam.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.280

Megan and Mike, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.880
We're happy to be here.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.720
It's great to have you here.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.920
I'm such a fan of space and just it's amazing to think about our place in the universe

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.700
and where we are.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.480
And so much of that has been revealed really through telescopes, right?

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.980
From the very beginning of like, oh, look, the sun doesn't rotate around us.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.560
How weird to, you know, the universe is expanding with what Hubble did

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.620
or just all the amazing discoveries we've had, the exoplanets and whatnot.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.240
So super cool.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.700
And if we're going to mix Python into that, it's definitely an interesting thing to do.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.520
So I'm happy to have you both here to talk about that.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.700
Yeah, we're happy to join you.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.140
It's a pleasure.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.000
Yeah, it's great.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.940
Let's just really quickly before we get into the topics,

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.780
maybe start with just a little bit of a story on your background.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.120
Now, Megan, how'd you get into programming and find your way over to Python?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.640
Yeah, so programming.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.340
I started young and it was mostly because I was jealous of some of the other kids.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.540
This is the early 80s that had access to the new Atari systems, the new Coleco Visions.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.440
And I didn't really have that.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.880
I wanted to be able to play games and do those types of things.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.620
And as it turned out, my dad had just bought one of these new computers in Osborne,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.840
which is kind of one of the early personal laptops.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.240
That was one of the very early ones.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.720
It might be the first laptop, a very heavy laptop, though.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.260
Probably not as good battery life as today either, I would suspect.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.320
I don't think there's no battery life.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.600
Yeah.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.280
And it only had a small green screen and you couldn't display graphics.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.840
But I was determined I was going to play a game on it.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:15.000
So I found this programming book in BASIC for microprocessors and followed along,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.580
learned what it was doing to create responses on the screen.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.580
I ended up making things like Mad Libs and choose your own adventure and ASCII art and

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.520
stuff like that.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.660
And just learning what the commands I was doing really did.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.880
So that got me into programming that I kind of just did that on and off.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.320
It was really strange, even though I was always working with computers.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.940
When I hit college, nobody ever suggested to me that I should do computer science or that

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.360
I should be a programmer or that I should do this other thing.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.520
So I went along with some of my other interests, which were astronomy and physics and music.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.920
But even in astronomy software and software engineering and working with computers is a must.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.680
And after I started working at the Institute for a few years, Python started to become a much more used language.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.340
It's something that could provide real benefit for the scientific community.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.400
And so I started learning that.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.060
And that's how I got into Python.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.820
Wow, fantastic.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.220
The days of just holding up a telescope and looking at stuff, those are pretty long gone, right?

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.780
Yeah, they're pretty long gone.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.920
In fact, most astronomers don't even get to go to the telescope on the ground anymore.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.500
There's a lot of remote observing.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.100
It was starting to switch over when I was in college.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.240
It's much, much heavier now.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.600
Yeah.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.940
Yeah.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.460
I can imagine.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.300
What a bummer.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.360
Those are amazing places.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.760
Yeah.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.020
How about you?

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.000
How do you get into programming, Python?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.980
Yeah, for me, I dabbed a toe in it in high school with a Fortran class.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.700
We actually got bussed over to another school to run our deck of cards through someone else's computer.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.680
Oh, with cards.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.120
That's another level right there.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.720
I'm that ancient.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.000
And then in college, a few classes here and there.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.180
And then when I got out, one of the only skills I had was programming.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.400
So I had a math degree.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.080
And so I started with programming in Fortran at the start, but then got into other languages

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.800
and eventually got to Space Telescope in 1996 and have been here ever since.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.820
It started with Python in about 2002.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.480
There was a software conference called ADAS, A-D-A-S-S, Astronomy, Data Analysis and Software

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.900
Systems.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.660
And we put one on, the institute that I work at, put one on in 2002 in Baltimore.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.220
And Python was really a highlight of that conference.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.340
It was really coming into its own.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.600
And that just kind of broke the door down for everyone at the institute.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.200
Oh, that's cool.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.580
Behind one of our founders, Perry Greenfield, who works at the institute, is very, very big

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.260
in the Python community.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.080
And he kind of led the way and we all followed.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.540
Right on.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.060
Well, it's certainly an amazing language for data science and for working with things like

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.940
these telescopes and whatnot.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.620
So it has a special blend of approachability, but you can actually do quite a bit of real

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.400
stuff with it.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.060
Whereas, you know, so many other languages are either approachable or you can do real stuff,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.900
but not both.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.300
Yeah.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.600
It also cuts down a lot on development time and lines of code and stuff like that, which

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.040
makes it a lot easier to maintain larger systems that can handle the Python.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.100
Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.500
I was so impressed with the clarity.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.400
When you looked at a piece of Python code, you stripped away all the syntax and all the

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.580
language decorations and it was just, the design was staring at you.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.380
So to me, it's the simplicity of it that's the best feature.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.420
Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:25.220
So let's start a conversation maybe by talking about where you two work at the Space Telescope

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.700
Science Institute.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.060
It just sounds so amazing.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.080
That is a cool thing.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.260
Yeah.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.280
So what do you do there?

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.340
Megan, you want to go first?

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.020
Yeah, sure.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:41.840
So right now I'm the technical lead for the data management system that's going to be accepting

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.040
and processing and distributing all of the data that we're getting from one of the next

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.740
big telescopes, the Nancy Gates Roman Space Telescope.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:55.200
So my day-to-day job is making sure that all that is designed and functioning and data is

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.580
flowing through and the software we're going to write for scientists to do analysis of that

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.480
data will run and is appropriate and accessible.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.700
That's kind of my, that's my day-to-day.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.940
Before that, I worked heavily on post-pipeline scientific analysis processing software.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.080
So visualization tools, data analysis tools, things that really the astronomy community

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.040
uses after we've constructed the data for them from the telescope.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.400
Okay.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.040
Tell us just a little bit about the data story of this.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.220
There must be a lot of data coming off of these newer telescopes with their huge resolution.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:31.780
Yeah.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.740
So there is a lot of data coming down.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:39.160
The detectors on board JWST are 2,000 pixels by 2,000 pixels.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.400
And there's a lot of them and there's a lot of instruments.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.380
And so we have to be able to manage all of that data stream coming through.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.360
And I might let Mike talk a little bit here since he works heavily on the ops side of the house,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.440
helping with managing that data.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.020
All right, Mike.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.500
Yeah.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.240
Take it away.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.980
What's your role at ST Sci?

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.240
My role is, yeah, it is a team lead for the data processing team, also a scrum lead.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.400
We use the agile approach to software development.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.460
And I'm focused completely on JWST science data processing and guider data processing.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:16.540
The data comes down to us through the deep space network of NASA and hits the ground,

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.280
comes up to us at Baltimore.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.860
We have the control center right at the building, so they're actually talking to the observatory

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.400
through the tel, right through there, our main building.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.080
And then the data feeds down to our processing systems.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.380
And that's where my code comes in.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.980
Making sure we got all the data, completeness checking, sending the data through the pipelines

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.340
and the processing systems with the right processing recipe so that we get the right kind of data

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.960
products out and getting them into our archive.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.400
The Institute has a well-known archive for astronomy data.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.120
And that's where a lot of astronomers come to do research and find data sets that they

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:49.860
can use in their science.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.740
A lot of that data is public, right?

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.580
It is.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.000
It is very much so.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.180
There's a proprietary period for some kinds of data so that scientists have a chance to

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.200
write their special papers that they proposed for.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.720
But a lot of data is made immediately public.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.040
And then other data becomes public after a bit of a window.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.000
Oh, interesting.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:15.620
So you might write a proposal for time on web or one of the telescopes.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.780
And then if that's approved, then you get your time, then you get your data.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.820
And of course, it wouldn't make sense to just instantly publish that because that's part of

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.320
your work, right?

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.780
Yeah.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.420
And so this is actually, you know, pieces of the entire process.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.800
The whole world of astronomers is allowed to propose to use these telescopes.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:42.400
And there's a telescope review process that happens where they submit their suggestions.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.520
This is what I want to do.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.160
This is how awesome the data is going to be.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.420
This is what I'm going to provide to the community and the discoveries I think I'll make.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:55.040
And a team of experts, you know, agrees and decides how much time everybody is going to get.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.500
And we have a lot of tools on what you might think of as the front end of this process

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.780
to help them figure out, you know, how long do the observations have to be?

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.180
If I'm looking through these filters and these wavelengths, what kind of errors am I going

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:09.560
to get?

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.940
You know, what's the exposure time?

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.600
How should I most effectively use the telescope time to get the science out?

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.540
Because telescope time is always, it's gold, right?

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:18.860
Right.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.280
Absolutely.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.760
There's one and only one of these things, right?

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.440
Yeah.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.360
This particular one.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.620
I didn't really think about that you, for asking different types of questions, there

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.040
was a different amount of time that you might need.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.760
I mean, obviously, if you're going to stare at space for a certain amount of time, it's

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.500
going to take that time.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:41.380
But I hadn't really thought about the different processing pipelines might require more data

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.380
to get the right level of accuracy and stuff.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.200
That's pretty interesting.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:44.620
Yeah.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.080
So it really does depend on what you want to get out of it.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.880
When you insert in different wavelengths, you have to look at those things for a long enough

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.880
amount of time to collect the light, to get statistical certainty, to get detections.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:04.120
But then you have to play that against the fact that as you look longer and deeper, your

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.160
field might get more crowded because you'll be able to pick up light from more distant objects.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:14.020
You may have things that are called cosmic rays, extra energy that gets added into the

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.980
detector that you don't want.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.720
That's not from your object, that's just messing up your data.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.640
And the pipelines take these things into account.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.740
We look for things that are, oh, this is not coming from the object.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:30.400
This is coming from something in space that we don't want to detect right now or something

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.960
that is being imparted by the instrument onto the data.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.900
And we want to remove the instrumental signatures.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.660
So that's what a lot of the processing software tries to look at.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:38.920
Yeah.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.620
Fantastic.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.180
Mike, anything you want to add to that?

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.800
Just one other kind of data is time-dependent data.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:49.140
You may need to look at objects over time, either calendar time or even many hours or many

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.580
days to see variability.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:56.080
And that's a big part of some of the data sets is they just stretch on for time so that you can look for

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.000
planetary transits or flares or various phenomena that might vary over time.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.320
Yeah.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.200
How interesting.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:08.840
One of the goals that Webb is trying to solve is to detect exoplanets, right?

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:14.460
And for those, you've got to watch multiple years of whatever that planet's year orbital

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.220
time is, right?

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.560
If it takes it three months to go around, you've got to watch the star for several three-month

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.120
periods, right?

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.160
Well, and even in the case that you don't know that the stars have planets, you want to find

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:25.760
new ones.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.760
You need to go back and look at that star multiple times so that you can detect that difference

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.580
in the light that it's emitting.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.740
So when the planet goes across the star amount, some light is going to be dimmed by that.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:43.460
Or if you're looking at spectroscopy, you might see the starlight passing through the atmosphere

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.040
of the planet itself.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.380
Yeah.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.860
Fantastic.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:46.320
All right.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.820
I want to dive into the Python side, given that that's what most people are interested in.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.440
But before we get into that, let's just talk real briefly about what are some of the science

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.800
missions and how is this, say, different than Hubble?

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.320
It looks really different than Hubble, right?

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.500
It's this bunch of hexagon gold plates that unfold instead of being a tube like a traditional,

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.540
even, you know, the sort of space telescope like Hubble is.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.020
It's got a tennis court sized shield around it and stuff.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.840
So whoever wants to jump in, tell us a bit about just like what is the goal and the science

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.220
of Webb?

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:21.660
Yeah.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.780
So Webb is really the largest space telescope.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:31.300
It does have segmented mirrors, 18 of them, that can be adjusted to make sure that the focus

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.260
is good.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.000
It's something like six meters across.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
It's really big.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.680
It's six and a half meters across the mirror.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:43.580
I think it's something like 21 feet in diameter, something like that.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:48.200
One of the things that makes it different from Hubble is not only the size of the mirror and

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.320
the size of the telescope, but Hubble orbits the Earth.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.900
And JWST is demonstrably not orbiting the Earth.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.240
It's not very close at all.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:04.140
It's out at the second Lagrangian point, which is a more stable point that things orbiting into

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.640
the Earth's sun system tend to collect at.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.880
And it's not even at that point.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.360
It's orbiting around that point and facing away from the Earth.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.220
And so one of the things that's really important for Webb is that it stays cool, that its instruments

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:18.920
stay cool.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.680
And that's why it has this big sun shield.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.600
And so the cold side of the telescope is where we have all of our instrument packages.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.340
And that allows it to pick up this infrared wavelength of light, which is sensitive to heat.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:49.220
And it allows it to do the science that we need to do to look at dust and look through dust and look all the way back, you know, to the very earliest time just after the Big Bang when light was starting to be visible, to collect and start to form objects and stuff like that.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:53.580
So the design of the telescope is very much to enable the science that's possible with it.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.100
And Hubble uses visible light?

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.080
Is that the difference?

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.360
So Hubble has a range.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:04.180
Hubble actually has instrumentation that looks at UV, visible and then near infrared.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.300
So it has a little bit of everything.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.880
JWST also looks at near infrared, but it goes much further out into the mid infrared as well.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.200
And I guess that goes through dust clouds and things like that better.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.820
It can.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:22.040
So you can switch between the different wavelengths of light depending on what types of phenomena you want to see.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:30.880
But also because we want to look very far back in time, what happens and what enables us to do that is the red shifting of the light.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:38.160
So because after the Big Bang and the expansion of the universe, the light gets stretched by the expansion of space.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.780
To look back in time, you want to look at the light that is of that similar wavelength that's been stretched.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.880
So that's why we're looking in the infrared wavelengths.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.940
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Datadog.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.640

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.500
Thank you so much to Datadog for supporting the show.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.440
So what are some of the missions?

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.080
I talked about the, you know, we talked about the exoplanet a bit.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.600
Exoplanets, galaxy history, evolution.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.600
Star formation.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.640
Star formation.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.780
Star formation.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.340
Looking at the chemical composition of the galaxies and of stars.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:15.200
So it really uses this combination of spectroscopy, imaging, and coronography.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:23.160
And the coronography is excellent for exoplanets because it allows you to put, you know, basically put a stopper in front of the star

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.300
and look for really, really dim things that are very close to it.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:27.540
Yeah.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.580
Solar system objects as well, and even things out in the comet, you know, or cloud.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.400
On the Kuiper belt.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.420
Things that we just can't see.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.600
We don't have anything that can get out there in the infrared like this telescope we'll be able to.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.560
That's going to be super exciting.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.180
Hubble really changed people's view of the world, right?

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:50.020
I'm seeing all the, like the sky full of galaxies and stuff like that.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.880
What do you think we're going to learn?

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.080
I mean, maybe it's too hard to predict, but what do you think is going to be surprising?

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.120
Or what types of things do you think we're going to learn and change our perspective with this?

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:06.200
I guess what I hear from most of the scientists is they know they're going to find out things that they never even thought of

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.160
because that's what Hubble brought.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:13.100
And when you put something up that's this groundbreaking, that it goes so far beyond what we can currently do,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:19.180
there's going to be just surprises that are just going to blow people's minds because they did not think that things were even possible.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:26.380
Hubble basically was involved in finding the acceleration of the universe, expansion, and that wasn't even conceived of.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:32.600
So things that are groundbreaking and just never thought of, the astronomers are open to those,

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.880
and they're waiting for the data to come in to start to get to look.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.620
Yeah, fantastic.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:41.240
All right, speaking of data, let's start talking about that side, Mike.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.860
You said the data comes in over the Deep Space Network.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.840
Is that my name?

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.440
Yeah, the Deep Space Network.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.440
Tell us about the kind of data coming in and how that all works.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.040
Sure. The Deep Space Network is what we use to talk to the observatory.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.020
We get a couple contacts.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:03.520
Well, eventually, when it's in steady state operations, we'll get a couple contacts a day where it'll download the data to us.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.820
Right now, we're in fairly steady contact.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:13.820
There are three ground stations around the world in Australia, California, and Spain that kind of give nearly continuous coverage.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.820
So they're getting the data down.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.040
What kind of bandwidth can you get on this network?

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:24.760
These networks are big antennas, and we share this with other missions, with other things that are in space that need to communicate.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.240
Like Mars rovers and whatnot.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.760
Like Mars rovers and stuff.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.520
And they typically operate in the KA and S-band regions.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.200
Yeah, cool.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.040
All right.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:34.320
I'm sorry.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.280
I didn't mean to derail you, Mike.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:35.580
Go ahead.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.200
No, all good.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.100
So the data comes down to the Deep Space Network facilities.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:46.100
It gets transferred up to the Institute, which is in Baltimore, to our flight ops team, the flight observation system.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.180
They get the data in several forms.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.860
They get binary files right off the flight data recorders.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:20:01.260
There's a recorder that captures both science data from the science instruments and engineering data that's monitoring the state of the telescope temperatures and pressures and various things.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:01.880
Right, of course.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:07.600
Because there's a whole control center going, it's focused right, it's still running, and things like that.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:07.860
Absolutely.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.220
Yeah.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.960
They have the health and safety of the observatory and then the science as well.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.440
So we get those binary files that come up.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.120
We get auxiliary files that are processed on the ground.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:31.820
We take the engineering data that comes down, extract out some really key parameters that are necessary for the data processing and put those in special files and send those over to our data processing system, along with kind of a summary of what the telescope was doing since we last contacted.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:38.840
So we know, I'd observe these things and these observations worked, these had problems, gives us kind of a status of things.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.700
And the other kind of data that we absolutely need is called ephemeris data.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:47.220
It tells us exactly where the telescope was at any given time, which can be important for some types of science.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.360
So all that data flows our way in files.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:57.580
We use Python tasks to whole a common disk area that files are dumped in and pick them up and transfer them to our processing system.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:02.320
So the telescopes receive the data, that gets processed probably at the tele, not the telescope.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.220
Ground stations.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:03.880
Ground stations.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:03.900
Ground stations.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:04.440
They receive it.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:04.600
Yeah.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:10.200
And then that gets sent probably over the internet, gets dropped into some like a local file or some cloud storage.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.040
You're watching that and then Python picks it up from there.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.640
That's right.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.120
That's right.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.140
We pick it up.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.280
We segregate what kind of data each is, send it on for various kinds of processing.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.780
We put a lot of that, those data files, right as they come in the door in our archive.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.860
So if we need to get them back out to look at them later, we can.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.860
We use a system of, for kind of distributing the processing called HT Condor.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:38.240
It's made by the University of Wisconsin and it lets us distribute the processing over a big network of machines.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:43.100
This was developed even before the cloud came into bay and now the cloud's just part of it.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.680
So we use that system to span out the data processing of these various types of files.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:54.460
And we have a lot of kind of data completeness checking that we do in Python where we got to register what came in, whether we got all the packets.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.800
The data can come in different orders.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.660
It can be split up different ways in the recorder.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:06.280
And you have to kind of do a bunch of data counting before you can send it down the pipeline for processing because otherwise you'll have holes in it and the processing will give you the best product.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:24.400
So we do all that pre-data accounting analysis and when we've got something that's got all the parts, we send it on down the pipeline with a particular processing recipe that tells the pipeline to apply these exact calibration recipes, make these exact kinds of files and get them into our archive for the scientists to retrieve and do science with.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.280
That's really interesting.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:32.040
So you're doing some of the error checks and all that kind of data cleaning stuff for them before they have to pick it up.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.360
Well, we also need to check to make sure that there wasn't an error in the transmission of the data that we got.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:41.340
Everything off the telescope that we thought we were going to get, whether things need to be retransmated.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:57.500
And we're recording all the information about the instrumentation surrounding the detectors, what the temperatures are on the telescope and saving that and associating it with the data so that when scientists are looking at it, they can make correlations with the different things that they see.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:57.960
Oh, nice.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.120
Teddy, the audience has a question that's pretty related to that.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.480
How do you manage potential disruption in data transfer?

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.900
Like if you lose the connection?

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.120
Do you all have to worry about that or is that handled like below the layer?

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.420
Okay.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:11.940
We do.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:12.520
We do.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.200
It does happen.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.200
It is handled upstream from us.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.220
The deep space network has that capability.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.900
Our flight ops team has to get them sometimes to retransmit the data.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:25.980
If we got it on the ground, but we just didn't get it to our institute, we can get it resent from another ground station.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:33.220
But if it really didn't make it all the way down from the observatory, then they've got to go back on the next contact pass and get it to retransmit to the ground.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:33.580
Yeah.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:42.500
So there must be some kind of protocol exchange over the deep space network, right, that sort of takes care of that for you.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:42.700
Yep.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.160
Yep.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.940
And as Megan said, that's a shared resource.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:51.660
So if they happen to be talking to the Mars rover or they happen to be talking to something else, we got to get in line with everyone else until we get our turn again.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.000
Sure.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.480
Also related to that is, you know, what's the latency between the first piece of data sent and the first one received?

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.240
I mean, we are at great distances talking about the speed of, you know, limited by the speed of light, right?

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.980
So it's not milliseconds, I'm sure.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.220
Yeah.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.260
Megan, do you recall what the travel time deal to is?

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.140
I don't recall, honestly.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.740
I don't know.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:18.680
Probably by the time we get it, we're talking minutes, some range of minutes, but I haven't calculated it recently.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.520
Yeah.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.340
Yeah.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.020
Very interesting.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:28.700
I mean, when we talk about data, you know, you may take pictures with your camera, with a CCD in your camera, and you'll see that picture immediately.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.720
And it's a square, and it looks like the scene that you got.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:40.240
But when Mike was talking about, you know, we're waiting for the pieces of the data to come, that square gets chopped up on board the telescope and sent to us in little tiny pieces, and we have to reconstruct it.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:40.520
Yeah.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.000
You don't do it all at once, right?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.480
And the other part of that analogy is if you hold your camera up and you take a picture of the sky, it's just a picture.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:58.560
We add all kinds of what we call metadata, supplementary data to that image that tells where it was pointed in the sky, what filters were in use on the observatory, what astronomer asked for this data, what data grouping is it part of?

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.780
They do groupings in what they call proposals.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:14.640
And so we have all this extra data that we put into the files so that someone coming in to our archive who didn't propose the data can still extract it and get some understanding of what was done, how that piece of observation was set up.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:21.780
That's a good idea, of course, because if somebody says, here's a directory full of large JPEGs, do science now, right?

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.020
That's, well, hold on.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:23.620
Exactly.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.360
They're beautiful and they're almost useless.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:26.720
Yeah.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.760
They're almost useless for science.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.680
Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.740
They would still make a good coffee table book, though, probably.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.840
Once they were cleaned up of the cosmic rays and all those things that Megan talked about.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.660
Once you combine all the multiple filter images, you get the pretty colors.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.760
Yeah, I bet.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.680
Yeah, those are amazing.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:52.560
Samperia asks, you know, what's the max onboard storage in case, like, the data, if there's an extended period where you can't get to it?

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.920
You know, how long will this thing run before it's just hard drive fills up?

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.220
Meg, do you remember the capacity for the recorder?

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.160
I know, because I have Roman in my head right now, so I don't remember the JWST capacity.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:11.880
But they take that into account, and that's how they've scheduled our contacts and downlinks with the deep space network so that we can get the data off in a reasonable time.

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.740
And it's not affecting, you know, scheduling of new observations.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.020
So they've done a lot of work.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:27.500
And a lot of the work that we've done with Hubble in the last 30 years, because we do scheduling and data processing on Hubble, has allowed us to understand how to best optimize those types of things.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.500
Yeah, very interesting.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.380
Yeah, you must have a lot of experience from Hubble because that's a lot of data as well.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:38.940
I was wondering how much computing happens on the telescope versus how much is it just a receptor and a transmitter?

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.420
There is a little bit that happens on board, JWST, especially in the instruments.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:49.260
Meg probably knows more of the details of some of the infrared instruments, but they do image differencing and summations.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.760
Infrared detectors build up their signal over time.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:27:01.360
And rather than send all those bits to the ground, there are some on-board calculations that are done so that they send a bit less to the ground than they actually collected.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:11.700
Yeah, so one of the things that's different about IR instruments than UViz CCDs is that we don't, every time, there is no shutter in the IR.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:17.040
Every time we want to know what the detector's collecting, we kind of ask it really nicely.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.840
What's the voltage of this pixel?

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.800
Then we ask it again, and we ask it a whole bunch more times.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.960
And that's the data that we send down.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:41.100
And knowing how that signal is accumulating in the pixel without removing the signal from the pixel allows us to do cool things with IR data that allow us to reject the cosmic rays that may have come during the course of the exposure and stuff like that.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:41.500
Nice.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.620
Do you have to do, like, stabilization?

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:48.220
I know the thing is probably pretty stable out there, but it's also looking really far away.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.580
Yeah, stabilization, yeah, it is looking far away.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.500
And it is mostly stable.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:57.620
Where it is orbiting around L2 is not a completely stable orbit.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:05.540
And so they do have to do station keeping, which I believe fires rockets to make sure that it's in the correct orbit.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:14.460
Yeah, one of the big pieces of news that was really great was ESA, the European Space Agency who launched this, did an excellent job of getting it right on target.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.880
So it didn't have to correct much, which means it has extra fuel to run longer to do that, right?

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.600
Exactly.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.460
They did an amazing job with that launch.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.980
That was like a flawless launch.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.660
It was really, really cool.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.140
Fantastic.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.700
All right, a real-time follow-up.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.480
We've got Adam out in the audience says,

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.280
JWST can store at least 65 gigs of science data.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:39.440
Downloads occur in two four-hour contacts per day where each can transmit 20.6 gigs of data.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:39.940
How about that?

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:40.240
Nice.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.000
When we reach steady state science operations, that's probably correct.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.320
Yeah, right now we're contacting a little more often because as they're going through commissioning, they really need to interact with the observatory much more often.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.360
When we get steady state operations, they'll send plans up to the observatory.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.160
And the observatory will just tick through the plan.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.560
It'll look at this star.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.580
It'll throw these filters in it.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:59.460
It'll turn to this galaxy.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.920
Look at these filters.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.440
Right.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.260
Go look at this planet.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.720
And it'll basically do it a program where right now they're interacting much more often with the observatory.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:15.340
So if you tell it to stare at this spot, this blank dark spot in the sky for four hours, you don't need to check in with it as frequently as long as it's...

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:15.760
Exactly.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.240
Exactly.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:16.820
Yeah.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:25.080
If you told it to stare at that spot and something went wrong, James, the web telescope is smart enough to skip ahead and go to the next thing in the schedule where Hubble was very ground dependent.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.700
Everything Hubble did had to be told from the ground.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:36.600
And James was T is a little bit more automated where it will, if it's got a problem with something it's trying to do, it'll just skip ahead to the next thing and someone else will reschedule that later on.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.440
So I heard that there's some kind of JavaScript stuff running actually on the telescope.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.540
Is there any Python happening there or is the Python story really once the data gets back here?

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.260
There's no Python on the telescope.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.500
There is JavaScript on the telescope.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:57.360
It is a forked private version of JavaScript from a while ago, I believe.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:04.620
There was a study done to think about what's the best way to do instrument commanding and that's what I believe is chosen.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.260
Yeah.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:05.660
Interesting.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.420
Yeah, it's fine.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.280
It doesn't really have numbers, but I guess you don't need numbers for science.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:09.800
So it's okay.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:18.340
Well, so, I mean, when you think about the volumes of data that are coming down from the telescope, we're also transmitting, you know, the science pixels as integers.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.180
They're unsigned integer arrays.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:24.180
And then when we do the actual processing, those are expanded into floating point.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:28.880
So there's expansion that happens on our end for processing and storage and analysis.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.300
Yeah.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:29.760
Cool.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.740
Mike, you mentioned this HT Condor.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.460
Maybe tell us a bit more about this.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.900
Is this something that people would find generally useful outside of telescopes?

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:39.620
Absolutely.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.440
It's a very generic product developed by the University of Wisconsin.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:50.500
Back in the day, they developed it because they had all these computers sitting around with people's desktops that they wanted to make use of.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:55.840
You know, people were using them for three or four hours a day and then going off to lunch and off to meetings and the computers were sitting there.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:05.360
And they used this system as a way to harness those cycles to the point where if no one's sitting at a computer, Condor could tell it could drop a job on that computer, run until the person comes back.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.620
As soon as they hit a keystroke, the job would leave that computer and if needed, go off and finish its work somewhere else.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.560
So it started in that realm and they just expanded and expanded over the years.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.040
Kind of like SETI at home or one of these sort of grid computing stories.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:18.460
Exactly.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.020
Exactly.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.420
It started in that realm.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:26.600
Now it can process over full universities using all the machines at a university, research clusters.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:30.100
They're government initiatives that have grid setups.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.980
Now the commercial clouds are involved.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.920
They have interfaces to AWS and Microsoft Cloud and a whole bunch of others.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.760
So they really expanded their access.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.280
It's highly used.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.200
The realm that pushes it the most are the ones that do the...

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.260
Oh, Megan, what is the big science that just came out last year?

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.240
I'm throwing a blank.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.660
The big science that just came out?

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.600
Yeah, the detectors where they found...

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.580
Not LIGO.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.640
LIGO, thank you.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.120
Oh, that's right.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.980
Something about space and black holes, yeah.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.380
The computing demands of those detectors are just...

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.600
They make JDBST look like a pen.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.480
Oh, really?

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.280
Computing on your pen.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.700
So they're really off the charts.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.540
They need so many cores and clusters to do their computations.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.640
And this is one of the only systems...

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:15.960
Condor is one of the only systems around that can get them the access to the cores they need.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.920
And it's highly used in the LIGO community.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.880
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by the Stack Overflow podcast.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.060
There are few places more significant to software developers

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.160
than Stack Overflow.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.820
But did you know they have a podcast?

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:36.540
For a dozen years, the Stack Overflow podcast has been exploring what it means to be a developer

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:41.180
and how the art and practice of software programming is changing our world.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:46.140
Are you wondering which skills you need to break into the world of technology or level up as a developer?

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.620
Curious how the tools and frameworks you use every day were created?

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:54.440
The Stack Overflow podcast is your resource for tough coding questions

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.580
and your home for candid conversations with guests from leading tech companies

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.780
about the art and practice of programming.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.400
From Rails to React, from Java to Python,

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:08.480
the Stack Overflow podcast will help you understand how technology is made and where it's headed.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.280
Hosted by Ben Popper, Cassidy Williams, Matt Kierninder, and Sierra Ford,

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.420
the Stack Overflow podcast is your home for all things code.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.080
You'll find new episodes twice a week wherever you get your podcasts.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:26.440
Just visit talkpython.fm/stackoverflow and click your podcast player icon to subscribe.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.360
And one more thing.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.160
I know you're a podcast veteran and you could just open up your favorite podcast app

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.980
and search for the Stack Overflow podcast and subscribe there.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.840
But our sponsors continue to support us when they see results

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.520
and they'll only know you're interested from Talk Python if you use our link.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.880
So if you plan on listening, do use our link, talkpython.fm/stackoverflow to get started.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.460
Thank you to Stack Overflow for sponsoring the show.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:53.280
And I think Python too is a huge part of that LIGO result.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:53.820
It is.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.200
They use a lot of Python.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.720
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.260
Condor has a full Python interface.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:03.400
So you can talk Python right to Condor, import the package, and you're off and running.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.060
Yeah, that's really neat.

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:09.100
Just pip install or Condor install HD Condor and off it goes, right?

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:09.620
Something like that?

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:09.780
Yep.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.900
Pip install power.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:11.820
Awesome.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:17.380
You mentioned that it takes advantage of these computers, which are kind of sitting idle.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:22.640
And of course, we've got like folding at home and we've got SETI at home,

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.280
those types of things, which they seem to have gone away, which I think it's a little bit sad,

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:26.560
actually.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.880
But there's been these things where it's like, well, if a personal computer is sitting around

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.740
idle and we've got a bunch of them in an office or a university or whatever, then we could use them.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.340
That's great, right?

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.680
But you also mentioned the cloud.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:42.360
And I guess I had never really thought about it, but I know the cloud providers don't want this

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:42.660
from you.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:48.320
But if you pay for a virtual machine, there's a good chance that it's sitting there doing 20%

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.940
of what it could do, right?

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:54.160
So you could actually, if you've got 10 or 100 virtual machines running in the cloud, you could

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:54.620
say, you know what?

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.400
Whatever extra capacity you have, I'm going to use that for this other sort of scheduling

00:34:59.400 --> 00:34:59.920
service.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.260
The good thing about astronomy is most of it doesn't have to happen in real time.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:09.740
So we can buy up the cheap cycles where the machines are not being used one hour on a clock

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:14.540
and get good deals to go off and do our reprocessing and processing that has to happen.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.000
Right.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.400
Like reserved instances or something like that at AWS.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:18.940
Right.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.300
HST is already doing some of their process of reprocessing in the cloud.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:27.340
That's another point is we get the data down from the observatories once and we process it once,

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:31.920
put it in our archive, and then we reprocess it again and again as the calibration algorithms

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.440
improve, as software bugs are found, and as reference data, it's particularly calibration

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.520
reference data, special data that's used to remove those instrumental signatures that

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.440
Megan was talking about.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.080
As all that supplemental data and algorithms improve, you rerun the data again and again and

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.500
you need the computational capacity to do that while data is still coming down from the telescope

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.120
because your archive is getting bigger all the time.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.180
So you've got a bigger crank to turn to get everything up to the best possible product it

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:58.480
could be.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.380
That is pretty fascinating.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.880
I hadn't really thought about that you would have to reprocess the data, but sure.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:10.060
It drives all our designs because we reprocess the data tens of more times than that very

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.020
first time it hits the ground.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:11.340
Sure.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.160
What does the compute stuff look like for you all?

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.960
Are you using GPUs?

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:21.520
Are you using some of the NumPy, SciPy, AstroPy stack to do this?

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.900
Those are definitely involved, yeah.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.400
Yeah.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.100
So GPUs, I don't think we have an excessive amount of GPUs.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.800
Probably those are more in the post-processing parts of the software.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.880
But those other things you mentioned, most definitely.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.540
And we actually are heavy contributors to those packages as well.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:37.980
Fantastic.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:44.220
We do a lot to provide back to the community the software that we're creating, especially

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:50.680
our external data analysis, post-processing analysis software, so that it can be used by

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.540
the rest of the community.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:51.800
Yeah.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.220
Samapriya asks, what can a user at home do with the data?

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.900
Or do you need these huge clusters, compute clusters, to work on them?

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.460
There are no books?

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.320
Yeah.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:08.480
So if people are out there listening, I suspect there are some astronomers who have an expertise

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.500
in this, but there's probably a lot of people who are just fans of space and might want to

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:12.960
play with this.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:19.120
So any data that's public that you can access in our archive, you can download and you can

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:19.780
analyze it.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.240
You can install the science calibration software.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:28.520
So the stuff that takes the data that we've already prepared for you and does further analysis

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.680
on it, we have visualization tools you can install.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:37.180
We have many different things that scientists or even non-scientists might want to play with

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.080
to look at the data.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.260
That's all possible.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:44.120
I do that with Hubble data all the time on my laptop and my laptop just has 16 gigabytes of

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:44.320
RAM.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:50.300
And now Hubble data is fairly small compared to the machines we were running on.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.820
Yeah, I bet when it first, how old is Hubble?

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:53.620
20 years?

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.040
30.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:54.420
30.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.340
Yeah, 30-year-old computers probably thought that data wasn't small.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:57.780
Yeah.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:03.100
So we've gone from terminal services to desktops and laptops and back to terminal services eventually

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.340
in the near future because of the size of the data.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:05.700
Yeah.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:11.100
So do you have notebook servers that are running close to the data that then you can log into

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:11.700
and play with?

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.640
Or what's that look like?

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.520
So we do at different levels.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.760
You're talking about Jupyter Notebooks, Jupyter Lab, that type of thing?

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.180
Yeah.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.980
So that does exist.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:25.660
We've been playing around with science platforms in the cloud to give people access to not only

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.420
the software, but the data in a very easy way.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:34.340
And I think Jupyter Lab makes that really, really effective for the tools that we can provide

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:34.940
to people.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.240
Yeah.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.920
But you can also run it yourself on your own local machines.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.240
Sure.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:43.140
As the data gets bigger and bigger, part of the cost and latency is just transferring it,

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:43.280
right?

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.540
So if you can run your compute close to it, you can save money by not transferring it and all

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.280
sorts of things, right?

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:48.840
Exactly.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.720
Or reading it into memory for very, very large files.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:56.880
As a system, the system itself needs to be very large to process the sheer volume of data

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.460
that we get and are constantly getting and reprocessing and storing and serving.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:06.000
But for individual data pieces, it's still very possible for people to process it on their

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.160
own.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.420
Sure.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:11.020
Do you use things like Dask or any of these sort of Panda NumPy-like things that scale

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.420
out to larger data?

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:12.820
Yeah.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:17.020
And it depends on the tool and what the purpose is that you're using.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:17.420
Sure.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.260
For sure.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.660
Mike, got some thoughts on this before I move us along?

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.500
No, that's a really good summary of the picture.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:24.760
Yeah.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.860
And I think, I'm pretty sure at this point, all the public HST data is in the cloud.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.180
I think it's all on AWS.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.920
And I believe you can work with it there.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.520
Yeah.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.180
Especially if you've got research to do.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:35.560
Yeah.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:40.200
So one of the things that got my attention, besides someone, I think, sending me a message,

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:46.660
hey, you should talk to the JWST folks, is you have over at, on GitHub, you have the Space

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:52.400
Telescope Science Institute, where you've got all kinds of various things that people can

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.240
go play with, right?

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.060
Maybe tell us a bit about some of the highlights over there.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.360
The one that I ran across is just JWST.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:58.900
Yeah.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.900
Which is, it describes itself as the Python Library for Science Observations from the JWST.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.000
Yeah.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.320
So this is the, what we call the science calibration package for JWST.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:17.080
The software that lives here is able to do the detector calibration that we talked about

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:22.280
and image combination and everything else that we need to do to create the standard products

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.560
we've agreed to create for the mission.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.700
That's all contained in this package.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:32.200
And this package gets installed in our backend systems to be run as we're processing the data.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.180
And it's ready to be processed at this level.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:42.020
So this is what users would install if you wanted to reprocess or do higher level analysis,

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.900
the JWST data for the different instruments.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.100
You spoke about the reprocessing and the reanalyzing.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.620
So you would install this.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:55.540
And if you had an idea on how to maybe do different noise reduction or other processing,

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:56.860
this is what you use.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:57.260
Exactly.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.100
Exactly.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:58.380
Exactly.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:03.320
We performed some base calibration to put the data in the archive and to make it somewhat

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:03.700
usable.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.480
But most high level scientists are doing their own recalibration and they're tuning the data

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.340
for what they're trying to get out of it.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:14.520
Especially if they're working at the margins of noise and other things where they really have

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.820
to work with the data to get out of it to fit their science needs.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:21.900
So a lot of this is the byproduct of this proposal process because we don't know where

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.600
the science is.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.560
It's going to come through.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.180
We try to provide the best generic processing for all the data.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:27.480
Right.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.180
It's pretty neat that this is just here on GitHub.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.000
That's cool.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.500
Yeah.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.440
I suspect when Hubble came out, it was not like, well, here's the open source thing and

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.480
here's how you contribute back in the same way.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:37.820
Right.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:44.620
I'm sure it was shared to some degree, but the openness of science and really the computational

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.000
bits of science over on GitHub is pretty amazing.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:47.920
It's a lot of fun.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.940
I think we started using GitHub when it first came out.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:56.680
We were, especially during Hubble, using subversion and even older version control systems.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.440
CVS or something dreadful like that.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.780
CVS, RCS, even.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.220
Whatever we could use.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:01.800
Yeah.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.160
They were run on internal systems and managed on internal web pages.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:12.580
So when GitHub came out, it was really nice to be able to share our software, not only with

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:18.460
astronomers in the larger community, but with other missions that we interact with and to

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:23.820
be able to talk to them about how we develop and accept changes and improvements into the

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.120
software.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:24.460
Yeah.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:32.720
You see right here, there's a 541 issues and 20 PRs that are open, but 3,462 that are closed.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.080
Yeah.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:33.840
And that's pretty amazing.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.240
Yeah.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.220
That's what we do a lot of work.

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.820
And JWST is a new mission now.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.260
Yeah.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:40.700
Awesome.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:48.200
So another thing that I ran across that looks interesting is the web PSF, which is a simulation

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.180
tool, right?

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.320
Maybe tell people about this.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.740
So web is obviously the telescope.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.340
PSF are point spread functions.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.700
This is the statistical pattern that light falling on the detector from a star would make.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:06.380
And you can predict what that pattern is going to be based on the optics that are in your

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:06.900
telescope.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:13.680
And so this piece of software takes that understanding of the optics in the telescope and how light

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:19.700
gets transmitted through those optics, including through different wavelengths, and create simulated

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.320
images of what we might be able to see.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:30.900
This allows us to not only predict how the telescope is going to perform in different ways, but develop

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:36.900
our software, develop the algorithms that we use to do pull out stars and stuff from images.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.300
Yeah.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:37.920
Very neat.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.980
I suspect if people didn't have access to the telescope and they wanted to play around

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.360
with some stuff, maybe they could use this.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.260
Yeah, they could.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.680
There's other simulation tools that are out there that will simulate full astronomical scenes

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.140
as well.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:55.520
So not just individual stars, but galaxies and the combination of the two.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.740
Do you have something you can point people at?

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.560
I think I'd have to send you a link.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.180
Yeah, we'll put it in the show notes.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:01.560
Yeah.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:01.960
Okay.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.040
So people can get to it.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:03.400
That's great.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:03.900
Let's do that.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:04.140
Yeah.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:04.440
Awesome.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:09.260
Another thing I ran across looking at all this stuff is this place called Astro Conda.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:14.400
And there's a whole bunch of stuff, just tons of libraries in here.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.200
It looks like there's a lot of neat things like, for example, working with the ASDF file format,

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.920
which I suspect is something that you all provide a lot of.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.140
Yeah.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:23.800
And so on.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.820
So we developed that format.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.000
We wrote that format.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.100
The primary interpreter is in Python.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.300
So a little bit of astronomy history.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:37.220
Astronomy for a very long time has used a file format called FITS, Flexible Image Transport

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:37.820
System.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.900
It started around the time data was being saved on tapes, a tape store.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:46.680
You might want to optimize for different things if it's going on tape and SSD.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.320
Right.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.660
And so it's been in the community a long time.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.800
And a lot of community tools are based on it, accessing it.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:59.520
It was a big part of this other thing in the astronomy community called IRAF, which was

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.600
a common software package.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:06.440
It actually had its own virtual operating system and command line languages that did the reduction

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.160
for us.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:14.360
One of the things that JWST wrote about is we needed to be able to handle those complex

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:20.240
optical path descriptions for how the light from a star you're observing gets onto the

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.020
detector and how you translate those positions back and forth.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.460
So where's telescope pointed?

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.220
Where is this light as it's moving around?

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:32.420
And how can I tell at this pixel what star that relates to in the sky?

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:37.080
Yeah, it seems very non-trivial because you've got all these different hexagonal pieces that

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:41.180
are independently adjustable and you've got to sort of reassemble that into a continuous

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:41.740
thing, right?

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.880
So that's part of it.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:47.200
And even larger part is the number of optics that are in that chain and then the optics

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.720
inside each of the instruments.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:54.240
And some of them are spectroscopic instruments that divide light into its constituent wavelengths.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:59.200
And those wavelengths have different travel paths and will fall on the detector in different

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:04.820
places in mathematically predictable ways, but not always simple mathematically predictable

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:05.380
ways.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:09.460
And so saving that information was really difficult in fits.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:15.960
And we developed this new format that will allow us to save analytical models into the

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:21.580
data itself that can then be opened up by the users and very easily used to understand the

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:26.200
relationship between the stars and the pixels that they are looking at and the stars in the

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:26.460
sky.

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:33.800
And so we started JWST with that and it actually gets packaged into a fits file, but in later

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.600
missions, we'll be using just as diff.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.840
Yeah, that's really neat.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.280
So lets you save more of just the raw data.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:47.160
It gives us a really nice way of saving information we need to understand about the data along with

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:47.980
the data itself.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.620
We'd also save the binary arrays.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:55.080
It's actually, if you were to look at it, the text part of the format is YAML based on JSON

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:55.840
schema standard.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:56.160
Yeah.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:56.980
Oh, fantastic.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:03.820
So looking through this AstroConda thing here, obviously there's stuff that's very focused

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:09.720
on astronomy like ASDF, but there's also other cool libraries like APTRS.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:13.840
There's all these like little things.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:19.580
So if I want to write something to a temp file or where's my user home or stuff like that,

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:19.720
right?

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.740
You can ask questions like that of this APTRS thing.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.800
Yeah, that's interesting.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:28.180
I actually, I haven't looked at APTRS, but it must be being used by one of our other sub

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.960
packages and somebody wrote it, wrote it for a good purpose.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:36.680
This AstroConda site that you're looking at was, you know, this repackaging of tools that

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:43.040
are written in Python, often with C extensions that can be used by astronomers in the community

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.320
to do what they need to do to look at the data, calibrate the data.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:51.420
And so this AstroConda channel is a Conda channel that allows us to organize that information

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:54.740
and deliver it to users who are using Conda environments.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:55.040
Nice.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.100
Or virtual environments.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:56.420
Yeah.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.500
You can say something like install this channel, everything in this channel, and then you'll

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:05.360
basically be able to do most of the work that we're talking about or something like that.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:05.680
Right.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.600
And so most of these are now available also separately on CondaForge and PyPy.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.020
So often people will install from there too.

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:13.300
Sure.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:13.960
Yeah.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:19.320
So we've got, let's see, ASTEval, a safe, minimalistic, evaluated for Python.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.340
That's pretty cool.

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:25.080
You've got mysterious ones like CubeTools, which just refuse to identify themselves.

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.880
That's actually for 3D images.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.960
So we stack things up.

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.360
Yeah, cool.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.420
Anyway, I'll put the link to this in the show notes so people can look around.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.060
It's just interesting to see all the stuff that you were bringing together here.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.360
You've got the STSI version.

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:44.720
That's, you know, a meta package for Conda that will install the individual things that

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.100
go together.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:45.960
Yeah, of course.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.380
Of course.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.080
All right.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.700
This JWCS one sounds pretty interesting.

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:57.940
One of the challenges with the telescopes, I'm sure, is, you know, things orbit around other

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:02.200
things which are orbiting around other things, you know, around the sun, which is around through

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.160
the galaxy and whatnot.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:03.580
Right.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:07.140
So figuring out where you're pointing is probably pretty tricky.

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.680
Is that what this library does?

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:13.420
So when I was talking about being able to understand the light and where it is in the sky and on

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.300
the detector, this is what we're saving in the ASDIF file.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:20.720
These GWCS representations, generalized world coordinate system.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.040
And that's a mouthful.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:27.940
World coordinate systems are what astronomers use to relate, you know, an undistorted scene

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:30.600
on the sky to what you have on the detector.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.840
And it changes depending on what the telescope optics are.

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:41.240
But what GWCS provides is layered on top of astropy modeling, which allows you to string

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:46.960
together mathematical models to translate coordinates between two different systems.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:52.760
So we use this for translating perfect sky coordinates to detector coordinates and intermediate

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:53.920
systems as well.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:50:00.080
And one of the benefits to that is sometimes there are effects that happen in the detector

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.660
that should be corrected at different stages along the way.

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.620
And you can insert those corrections in this pipeline of models.

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:12.680
It makes sense to correct in this coordinate system, potentially, rather than at different

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.020
levels.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:13.840
Something like that.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.180
I see.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:14.420
Right.

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.000
Right.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:15.280
Yeah.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.100
Pretty fascinating.

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.840
It sounds complicated.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.400
It's cool.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.160
Yeah.

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:19.460
It's cool.

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.620
It is definitely cool.

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:25.820
It's built on a lot, you know, on other open source code that is useful for more things

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:26.640
than just astronomy.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.020
Right.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:30.100
Modeling is useful for everything in science.

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.620
Fitting is useful for everything.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.300
So it's cool that we can, you know, help provide tools like that to the community.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.160
Yeah, for sure.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:41.520
What's the machine learning story around the telescopes and the data?

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.980
Are you all doing anything with that?

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:44.100
Any AI stuff?

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.860
Avery, you want to take it?

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.420
So I'll talk about, you can pipe up Mike for the HST stuff if you want.

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:50.620
I'm not familiar with that aspect.

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:51.020
I know.

00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:56.620
So, yeah, obviously we have data science groups at the Institute that are doing a lot

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.460
of machine learning.

00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:03.200
Machine learning can be applied to things like the catalogs of objects that astronomers scrutinize

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:07.880
details about what these things are that are confirmed that can be used to build up information

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.640
about unknown images.

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.440
Machine learning for processing.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:17.120
We've started doing some of that for the HST processing in order to optimize scheduling,

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:23.120
time, spreading the data out, understanding if there are certain metadata keywords, like

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.300
what Mike was talking about before, that we know will affect the processing in certain

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:27.820
ways.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:30.600
We can detect that early and make up for it.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:30.920
Interesting.

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:35.660
How much of a challenge is an optimization problem of who gets time when?

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:39.740
So this person wants to look here and do this, then that person is going to look over there.

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:43.720
But if there's somebody that wants to look in the middle, maybe you could save some fuel

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:49.280
by turning a heart way, letting them do their job, like skip ahead in line and then keep moving.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.360
It's a great point.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.040
It's not only fuel, it's you don't want to move your mechanisms more often than you have

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:54.200
to.

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:58.280
So you don't want to flip the filter wheel three positions left, 10 positions right,

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:02.280
when you could have done that in a more economic way and save the wear and tear on your system.

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.880
So there's a lot of optimization that goes into the planning and scheduling system.

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.220
And of course, with astronomy, there's visibility.

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:13.400
You've got a certain targets are not visible, not visible at all times of the year, just depending

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.740
on where they are relative to the sun.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:15.020
Right.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.820
You can't turn around and look right past the sun because it'll...

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:18.100
Oh no.

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:22.680
JDBC especially cannot look back.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:27.720
Even in the software, there are defined regions of avoidance that we are not allowed to move

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.240
the telescope.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:34.840
And so we have planning and scheduling systems that know what these things are, that know

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:42.120
the range of places that this telescope proposal approval community has decided to point the

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:42.480
telescope.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:49.640
And it figures out what is the most optimal way to organize those observations to get them

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.600
to the astronomers as fast as possible.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.240
I see.

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.280
Towards the end of our time together.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:58.680
What other things are you doing with Python you think people find interesting that maybe

00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:59.820
I haven't asked you about yet?

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:01.040
Or did I cover everything?

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:04.380
We covered a lot of graph.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:04.640
Yeah.

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.820
There's a lot of nuts and bolts that the data processing side has to do.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:09.500
You know, we interface with a lot of databases.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:14.520
So we need database interface packages that talk to Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite database

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.500
files and things like that.

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.380
As Megan said, we do a lot of parsing.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.660
So we're JSON parsing and XML parsing.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.700
And so all those packages come into play.

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:26.420
And then there's good old-fashioned bit busting where we've got to get into the telemetry binary

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:32.660
files and bust out the sections of bits that are the data from the wrappers that come down

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.480
that let us make sure we got the right data.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:35.000
Figure it out.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:35.220
Yeah.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.120
Exactly.

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.120
So various packages across the Python scheme help us.

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.040
And there are a lot of external community packages that help us as well.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:47.200
And then there's also all the documentation that has to be done for every user, especially

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.140
for our externally delivered packages of Sphinx.

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:50.580
Okay.

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:51.820
And code documentation.

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.200
We have a lot of our stuff on Read the Docs.

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.280
A lot of our infrastructure for testing.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:02.340
I just had the folks on from Myst and have to do a better search to get something other than

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.340
a video game.

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:06.740
But the Myst project, do you still do all your stuff in restructured text?

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.500
Or are you doing any of the markdown things with Myst?

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.500
I'm not doing anything with Myst.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:15.200
I have done a lot of restructured tests and pure LaTeX.

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.060
And Sphinx helps with those two things, too.

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:21.040
A lot of the scientists themselves just write pure LaTeX.

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.240
They just write all their papers in pure LaTeX.

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.760
And the symbols for it are so crazy.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.500
It's so many.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:27.000
Yeah.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.780
But what comes out of it is really remarkable.

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.580
So, yeah, it's worth it.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:32.700
I mean, it's really pretty.

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:36.500
I remember being introduced to it even as an undergrad in the 90s.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.700
And it was like, this actually looks much cooler than Word.

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:40.360
Yeah.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.320
Absolutely.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:41.900
Yeah.

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.520
When I was in grad school, I did some of my homework in LaTeX.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.540
But I haven't touched it for many, many years.

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.720
Not anything practical.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.220
Yeah.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:54.500
They sell a lot of the journals and a lot of the astronomy conferences expect you to turn in

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:58.360
posters and papers written in LaTeX that conform to their standards.

00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.000
Yeah.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:54:59.320
Absolutely.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.320
All right.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.600
One final question I want to ask you about.

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.180
And Megan, you said you were working on this.

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:08.300
It's the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:08.960
Yeah.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:13.260
We haven't even really got the web telescope fully online.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.860
And you all are working on this next one.

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:16.120
Yeah.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.540
Give us an elevator pitch for this so people can be excited.

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.180
And what's the time frame?

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.300
So Nancy Grace Roman is really cool.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:30.740
It is also going to go out to L2 where JWST is sitting in part because it's an infrared telescope

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:31.320
as well.

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:32.900
It's focused in near infrared.

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:33.880
So more similar.

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.760
And the web one might get lonely.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.480
So it needs a friend.

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:35.780
Yeah.

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:36.160
Yeah.

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.360
I mean, there are some other telescopes out there too.

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.580
But yes, we need more friends.

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:45.060
And so it is about, the mirror is about the same size as Hubble.

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:48.400
But its optical prescription gives it a much wider field of view.

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.300
So 100 times the field of view of Hubble.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:54.380
And it has way more detectors than pixels.

00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:55.880
About 300 megapixels.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.780
So there's 18 detectors.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.720
And every time we take a picture, all those detectors are going off.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:06.500
So there's also a lot more data volume coming down that we get to process.

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.820
But a lot of cool things we can do.

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:12.620
We can reach the level of the Hubble deep field very fast.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:17.580
We're going to cover about 50 times more space in the first five years of this mission

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.480
than Hubble has in 30 years.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:23.980
So it's going to provide a lot of cool things for the community.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.040
It's also a survey telescope.

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:31.960
So a lot of its time is dedicated to some surveys that want to be done to support the community.

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.440
Looking for exoplanets.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:38.560
And they expect to find several thousand exoplanets during the first five years of the mission.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:44.020
Investigating dark energy and the expansion of the universe and the physics behind that.

00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:47.940
And so and other things that I'm sure astronomers will come up with.

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:53.980
One of the cool things is that it will be launched to be compatible and collaborative with JWST.

00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:57.040
And LSST, one of the large ground-based missions.

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.540
And Euclid, one of the European-based missions.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.920
So it's really cool to be in this era of astronomy where the missions can really be, you know,

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:08.220
working together to make cool new discoveries and take data.

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:08.860
That's fantastic.

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.320
I haven't even thought of them working together.

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:12.420
Quick question from Julian in the audience.

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:13.300
We'll wrap it up.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:18.320
How many of the experiments are providing data through the pipelines immediately versus

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:22.640
that priority, like private period that we talked about?

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.400
So some of that is up to the scientists.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:30.000
The scientists can choose when they submit their proposal to make the data public immediately.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.640
As soon as we get it, we process it, it's in the archive and it's there.

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.180
That's very, very fast.

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:41.520
One of the standards for Hubble is there's typically a year that the scientists have to look at the

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.680
data exclusively with their group and do the science they want to do.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:45.660
And then it'll be released.

00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.200
But I think that there are also cases of longer than a year.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.700
And wasn't Roman going to...

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:50.700
Roman has...

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.640
Yeah.

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.520
Roman has no proprietary period.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:57.880
The data will all be public immediately and we'll be serving data in the cloud and on

00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:58.120
front.

00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:58.480
Wow.

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.740
So no dragging your feet if you're trying to make a discovery and want to get credit for

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:02.880
it.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:03.660
No, no.

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:04.600
Yeah.

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.140
No scooping other people either.

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:07.420
You got to be on the ball.

00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.120
That's right.

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:08.680
Okay.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:13.880
So I think we got to leave it there, but it's really fascinating to see the ways that

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:18.780
Python and the data science tools are connecting us with space and these discoveries.

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:20.600
So thanks for sharing those.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:20.940
Yeah.

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:21.800
Thanks for having us.

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.360
You're quite welcome.

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:22.680
Yeah.

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:22.940
You bet.

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:25.780
Now, before you get out of here, you got to answer the final two questions, but there's

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:26.360
a couple of you.

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:29.300
So just maybe lightning around.

00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:33.860
So if you're going to write some Python code, what editor would you use these days?

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:34.840
I'm old school.

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:35.860
I'm a VI editor.

00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:37.340
Right on.

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:37.800
Yeah.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:40.760
I use VI, especially if I'm logging into servers and stuff.

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.840
I'm doing something quick.

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:45.780
If I'm doing a more complicated development, I usually use Sublime.

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:46.060
Okay.

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:46.700
Fantastic.

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.700
But in the past, I've used PyCharm and other ones.

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:48.960
Sure.

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.560
And how about a notable PyPI package?

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.300
Some library you came across recently and you're like, oh, this is so cool.

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.240
People should know about this.

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.800
I would recommend the Condor package.

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:02.580
If you've got to do any kind of distributed data processing, you should really know what

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:03.420
Condor is providing.

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:05.840
So I highly recommend exploring that.

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:06.200
Fantastic.

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:06.960
Megan?

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.140
I know we've talked about this.

00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:13.580
I was so excited to see PyLab come out because it provides us, not PyLab, I'm sorry, JupyterLab.

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:27.060
It provides us with so many opportunities to get the data and the analysis to our scientists in the easiest way possible and allows them flexibility to work on it with their colleagues and produce really good science.

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:39.900
But from the other side, I actually saw recently this package called Silly, which just produces random bits of data you can use for tests with all sorts of entertaining things.

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:40.180
Yeah.

00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:40.620
Silly.

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:47.520
I think you can even have it emit like Chuck Norris quotes and stuff like that, which can make it, you know, oh, no, that's PyJokes.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.720
That was the other one I've heard recently, PyJokes.

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:50.240
Oh, I love PyJokes.

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.020
You can have it.

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:51.700
Yes.

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.860
I love Chuck Norris.

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:54.180
Yeah.

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:56.200
He only makes programming better.

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:56.780
He does.

00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:01.200
And so silly is like faker, but silly.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.520
It's silly.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.980
I love it.

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:04.380
I love it.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:04.720
All right.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.360
Cool.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.240
Well, thank you both for being here.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:12.880
If people want to get started with some of the JWST data or some of the libraries, you know, what would you say?

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.860
Go to our archive.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:14.240
Yeah.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.100
Archive.stsei.edu.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:23.060
And as soon as the JWST data is coming through that they can look at, the public available data will be there.

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:23.320
Yeah.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.380
And there's tools already there.

01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:27.000
You can see, you know, the images, what they look like.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.300
You can play with them a little bit.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.440
You don't even have to know astronomy.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.260
They have both the FITS formats that make them talk about from scientists.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:37.820
And they have plain old JPEG preview images for folks to just browse and get a quick look at the sky.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:38.160
Okay.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:38.900
Fantastic.

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.420
All right.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.520
Well, Megan and Mike, thank you so much for being here.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.980
It's been great to chat JWST and space in general with you.

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:45.380
Yeah.

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.180
Thank you so much.

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:46.700
It was fun.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.200
Take care.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:47.500
Yeah.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:47.860
You bet.

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:48.100
Bye.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:51.380
