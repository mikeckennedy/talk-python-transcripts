00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.860
Often, people complain about the lack of developer skills in Western countries like the United States,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.940
and that problem is amplified when you consider typically underrepresented groups such as women and minorities.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:17.320
This week, you'll meet Laura Blankenship, who's doing more than her share to widen the appeal of programming to women in general and to Python in particular.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.500
This is episode number 27 of Talk Python To Me, recorded Monday, September 14th, 2015.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
Developers, developers, developers, developers.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.980
I'm a developer in many senses of the word, because I make these applications, but I also use these verbs to make this music.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.520
I construct it line by line, just like when I'm coding another software design.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.740
In both cases, it's about design patterns.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.760
Anyone can get the job done. It's the execution that matters.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.420
I have many interests. Sometimes I can flex.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.840

Now, let's get right to the interview.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.440
Let me introduce Laura.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.440
Laura Blankenship is the chair of the computer science department and intern dean of academic affairs at the Baldwin School,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.500
an all-girls K-12 school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.260
Laura, welcome to the show.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.320
Thank you.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.820
Yeah, I'm really excited to talk about teaching kids and especially girls programming today.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.000
Great. Me too.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.860
Yeah, I bet. That's definitely your passion, isn't it?

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.700
Yes.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.160
So we're going to talk about what you're doing at the Baldwin School.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:11.320
But before we get into specifically your work there, let's just take a step back and start where you started with programming and Python and all that.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.760
Okay. Well, it's a rather long, circuitous path that I took to get here.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.840
I actually don't have a degree in computer science.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.920
It didn't exist at my college when I graduated.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:31.980
So I did take computer science in seventh grade myself and then again in college, both in basic of all things.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.300
So, yay.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.100
Wow. That's pretty impressive.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.840
Usually it's either Java or C++.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.940
I know.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.120
My first course was in Scheme.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.400
Oh, yeah.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.360
Yeah, I haven't done a lot with Scheme, but I've seen it.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.540
My husband keeps trying to talk me into it, but I haven't gone there yet.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:00.480
So after college, I graduated with a degree in creative writing, of all things, and went to grad school for that.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:12.200
And then ended up basically paying for grad school by working either on the technology side in departments or specifically in IT departments.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.780
It pays better than poetry.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.700
So I just figured a lot of stuff out on my own.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.420
I mean, at the time, this was the early 90s.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.000
You know, nobody knew what computers could do or, you know, what they were capable of.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.460
So, and no one knew how they worked.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.880
So I would just take a manual and figure it out.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.360
And, yeah.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.840
So, I mean, most of the people that worked in those departments at the time were still using, like, IBM Selectric typewriters.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.320
So I had a little bit of an advantage over them.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:58.460
And basically, I then kind of got into mostly web development and design and worked across the street from the Baldwin School at Bryn Mawr College in their IT department developing educational technology tools.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.980
You know, you started before the World Wide Web.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.480
Yeah.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.620
And when people learn through books still, right?

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.260
So definitely an interesting time to get into programming.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.760
Yep.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.460
Cool.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.640
So that's how you got into programming.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.620
What about Python?

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.000
Like, what got you interested in that?

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.600
Well, so in our web development shop, we were mostly PHP, a little bit of JavaScript.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:29.280
And then when I, and I taught a summer program using mostly PHP and JavaScript and occasionally Flash, ActionScript.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.960
I just pretty much went wherever the students wanted to go.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:40.500
And then when I came over to Baldwin, I just, the thought of teaching them PHP sort of scared me.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.700
JavaScript, similarly.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:51.380
So I started looking for a language that would be a little bit easier for high school students, actually at the time, middle school students to tackle.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:05:01.440
So I just, Bryn Mawr's computer science department actually used Python and a little bit of Java, but they were shifting at the time to Python.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.640
So I just decided to go through, I went through a couple of Python books and it was easy for me.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.560
So I thought it would be easy for the kids too.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.920
Yeah, that's cool.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.200
And, you know, I think your intuition there is good because that's what the universities are switching to as well, right?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.800
Yeah, pretty much.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.060
Pretty much.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.320
Okay.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.000
So that brings us to the Baldwin School.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.940
And the Baldwin School looks really interesting.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.400
And let me actually read what you guys have for your little Twitter subtitle introduction or whatever that part on Twitter is called.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.980
Right.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:39.460
It says, Baldwin is an independent school for thinking girls who know the power of their own mind and use them to better the community and the world.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.140
That's a pretty awesome mission statement.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.740
It is pretty awesome.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.300
Yes.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.320
Cool.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.740
So tell us about it.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.280
So we are pre-K through 12 school, all girls, and have been since our founding in 1888.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:14.400
And, you know, the girls here are pretty amazing and, you know, really do start at a young age wanting to change the world, which is kind of cool that, you know, you'll have a seven-year-old running around thinking that they can do something that will make a big impact.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.900
And, of course, as they get older, they can realize some of those goals and dreams.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:28.120
And some of them do, you know, many of them do, you know, many of them do a ton of community service.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:42.900
So I think that's probably the biggest impact that they have is a lot of them work with a variety of organizations to do whatever, you know, those organizations need and often, you know, provide expertise that maybe those organizations don't have.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.220
It's really neat that you're teaching computer science at a deep level to these girls.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:07:01.800
I think so much of the idea or the opinion that you express that, hey, I can change the world, regardless if you're a man or a woman, is sort of the surroundings that you're in, right?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.380
Yeah.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.480
You know, the magic of places like Silicon Valley and those kinds of things.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.780
Partly, that's just a mentality, and people are drawn to that mentality.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.020
So you're around all these other people that have this mission to change the world, too.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.700
And, hey, if everyone else is doing it, why can't I do it, right?

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.640
Exactly.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.820
Cool.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.080
So that seems to be working really well for you.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.520
Yeah, so far.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.540
I mean, we've only had computer science here for five years, going on six.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.100
This is my sixth year here.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.240
I started the program.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:51.240
And so, you know, the student that graduated that first year, I used to boast a 100% rate of computer science majors because I had one student who enrolled in a computer science program at Purdue.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:58.820
So they haven't yet quite made it out of college and into the realm where they can, you know, maybe have a larger impact.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:12.940
But I think it's, you know, give me another five years or so, and I think you'll start to see some of our students, you know, end up in Silicon Valley or wherever they might end up, you know, making an impact on the technology world.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.040
I went to grad school at Purdue in math.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.760
And so I was probably in the same building, actually.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.540
Probably.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.240
Yeah, good luck to her.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.780
That's awesome.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:26.780
I think when people hear high school, and it's really important to emphasize this is not like a private college.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.740
This is high school, like you said, and below.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.080
Yeah.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.620
Yeah.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:38.380
Computer science, you know, a lot of states are struggling to even just allow a single programming course of some sort.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.960
And it's usually some kind of after school curriculum or activity.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:49.520
Maybe we could talk about the classes that you guys have, because I was really impressed with, like, how much you're offering to your high school girls.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.560
Yeah.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.600
So, interestingly, we start teaching computer science at the pre-K level.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.340
It's very basic, as you might imagine.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.400
My department and I are actually in the – I have four people in my department.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.620
We're in the middle of kind of deciding what our mission statement is.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:15.660
I think we're all on the same page, but just kind of, you know, coming up with what it is we do based on what we're kind of already doing.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:26.500
So, in the elementary school and the middle school, we have a program called the Dream Lab, which is a combination of computer science and engineering,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.840
the sort of heavy load of design thinking process in there.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.460
So, they do a little bit of everything.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.700
But we still think of the central thread of that as computer science concepts.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.840
And then once they get to high school, it becomes an elective.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.680
It's required through eighth grade, which is great.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.940
And then it becomes an elective.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.160
And we start with an intro course, a year-long intro course, and that's all in Python.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.640
And it's been a great course.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.960
The students end up doing a lot of different things.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.120
We work with robots, and we do some graphics projects and some game programming and things like that.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.660
That's really cool.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.940
And you do all that work with Python, right?

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.780
Yeah, all of it's with Python.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.560
Yeah.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:14.160
So, maybe we could talk, before we move on, maybe we could talk a little bit about, like, some of the libraries and stuff that you're using.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.800
Like, are you using something like Rosspy for the robots?

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.740
Or what kind of stuff are you doing there?

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.660
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.300
So, I've been using an IDE called Calico for about four or five years.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:32.360
And it has a lot of those libraries built into it, which is one of the things, as you know, with Python or any language,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:40.820
anytime you're trying to do, you know, special things like game development or graphics or robots, you need different libraries for that.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.920
And the nice thing about Calico is I don't have to go find them.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.900
They're already there.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.620
So, the robot libraries are built in.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.840
The graphics libraries are built in.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.640
So, it's been, you know, it's an easy-to-use system.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.980
And it was built for education specifically for that very reason.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.340
Cool.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:09.040
Is it kind of like what the scientific data science folks, say, like Continuum are doing with Anaconda, where it comes pre-built, but this is for education and teaching?

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.580
Yeah, exactly.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.200
Okay.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.940
And is it free?

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.640
It is completely free.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.660
Free and open source.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.460
Yeah, awesome.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.840
Okay, so you guys use that.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.400
That's cool.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:17.800
Yeah.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.380
Yeah, so that makes it really easy.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.120
We do experiment with some other IDs later.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:32.220
We, in CS2, which is the next level where we do focus mostly on object-oriented programming, I've been using PyCharm.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:39.120
And, you know, that's, again, because it's easy to install libraries via PyCharm.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.660
Right.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.160
It's all about installing things and making that process easy.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:55.000
I think that's what a lot of teachers in, you know, middle and high school struggle with is I'm lucky in that my IT department isn't locked down at all, but a lot of places it is.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So the idea of installing something that's going to actually write code is a little scary to a lot of IT places.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.560
Yeah, so that's really cool that you're using PyCharm.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:12.060
You know, I've said that I'm a huge fan of PyCharm on the show before, and I think actually the concept of using an IDE is,

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:18.560
it's very much a sort of dividing concept for the folks in the Python community.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.580
A lot of people are using Vim and Emacs, and they're like, we don't need that heavyweight stuff.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.300
Leave us alone.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.140
And then some people love their IDEs.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.900
I'm more in that group.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.020
You know, it really is nice in that you can just type import.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:37.720
Like, I could type import requests, and if request isn't there, it's like a hotkey to download and install that.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.520
Yeah, it is very nice.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.260
Yeah, so that's very helpful.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:48.580
I do teach a little bit of Vim or Emacs or whatever to my students,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:54.160
because I had a student a while back who went and did an internship at a university down the street,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.520
and she was really mad at me for not teaching her terminal and Emacs.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.840
And I was like, do you see how hard it is?

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:09.420
So I do introduce it to them and explain to them that there are a lot of professional programmers that use this instead of an IDE.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:15.540
But, you know, it's too hard for high school students to wrap their heads around most of the time.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:21.580
Installing those requirements and all that kind of stuff is just, you know, it's things in the way.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.740
It's not something you want to learn when you're new.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.500
Right.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:29.880
You just want to learn how to get something on the screen, make a turtle move, make a web page come up,

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.620
and you've got to have all these complex sort of sysadmin conversations.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:41.800
And if you can get that out of the way and push that down the road until you're like ready to have that sort of learning, I think that's way more valuable.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.480
Yeah.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.440
You start with this introduction to computer science, and is that mostly freshmen?

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.680
It's a range.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.660
It is mostly freshmen, usually ninth and tenth graders.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.960
And then I always get a couple seniors who need to fill out their, you know, course load.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.100
And it's great because it's one of the few classes we have here that is across all the grade levels.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.820
So they get to know students in the other grade levels, which I really like.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.920
And they often end up working together on projects, too.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.060
Yeah, that's cool.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.140
And you said that with these classes, they're very project-focused.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.040
Do you maybe want to talk about that a little bit?

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:25.620
You know, I probably a lot of us learned computer science in our classes or however we learned them via lecture primarily.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.040
And it was kind of painful.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.320
You know, you would get the lecture.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.860
You'd go do the problem sets, turn them in, and hope for the best.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:38.840
And you didn't get to do a lot of projects, maybe at the very end or, you know, midterm kind of things.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.800
But you don't really get a lot of practice doing the projects along the way.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.100
You're just doing these exercises.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:48.720
So I specifically structure my classes so that it's pretty much all projects.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.500
We do little ones and then big ones, and they just kind of build on each other.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:15:00.280
So we'll do a few things where I kind of treat it like a science class where I teach a concept like loops, for example.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.440
And then we'll do a little lab with a lot of different ways of experimenting with loops.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.140
And that'll just be the class period, and the lab is done.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.680
So it's like you're in a science lab and you have to have the equipment.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.460
And then they might do, you know, another concept.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.560
So we might do two or three concepts in a row.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:22.040
And then I'll have them do a project where they're going to have to implement those concepts in some way.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.580
So it might be a graphics project.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.960
It might be a game project.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.000
It might be, you know, working with the robots.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.160
So, like, we have a robot dance project where, you know, if you're going to make a dance step, you're going to do it over and over again.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.440
And it's going to have to be in a loop.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.600
So that's the way I've structured all of my classes.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:50.600
And it's interesting because sometimes the students get frustrated that I'm not, you know, specifically telling them all this stuff and having them just regurgitate it to me on a test.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.620
You know, they figure out what they need to know as they're working on the projects.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.280
Yeah.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.540
Well, I was on the other side of that when I was in college.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:05.140
My computer science courses, my first one, all the tests were on paper.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:13.200
And, you know, this is not a better way to learn, you know, even though it might be easier to, like, fill out some sort of multiple choice or something.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:13.740
Yeah.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.000
Right.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.700
Yeah.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.160
They'll be thankful in the end.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:16.600
That's cool.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.700
I have gotten those notes that they're thankful in the end.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.160
So I know it's working.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.560
That's really cool.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:23.860
Okay.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:35.820
So in your first one, you probably cover things like loops and declaring variables and input and output and, you know, maybe importing some modules so that you can, you know, do your robots and so on.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:41.600
And then the second one, you move on to, like, more modeling type stuff, right, with object-oriented programming and that kind of stuff?

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.400
Yeah.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.240
So object-oriented programming mostly.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.040
And, of course, they've been using objects the whole time.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.280
And it's always a shock to them when they realize that they've been using objects the whole time.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:17:00.340
And then we, of course, learn how to create our own classes in the second course.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:10.000
And we do – I do a really short project so they can just learn the basics of what a, you know, class structure is and how it works.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.740
And then we do two bigger projects.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:25.900
I do a data analysis project where they have to gather some data from the Internet in some way, shape, or form and then analyze it and visualize it.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.180
So it's kind of a three-step process.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.040
So just getting stuff off the Internet is a challenge.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:39.180
And then, of course, pulling it into some sort of form that they can work with, like a CSV file or something, is another challenge.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:46.300
And then, you know, taking the raw data and turning it into something that we might want to look at is the third challenge.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.180
So that always takes longer than I think it's going to, but I'm always hopeful.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:18:01.820
And then we do a simulation together sort of as a class where everybody creates their own objects.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.900
They create their own classes.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.200
We sort of decide what the simulation is going to be.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.500
We did an aquarium one year.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.400
Last year we did the North Pole.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:19.960
So we had Santa land and we had, you know, reindeer objects and Santa objects and elf objects and candy cane objects.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.900
And, yeah, it was kind of fun.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.240
Yeah, I bet that was a big hit.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.340
It was.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:24.800
It was.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.580
So everybody has to create their own object and they have different methods and eventually they all interact with each other.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.860
And, you know, it's kind of a fun little project that we have.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:41.140
And it sort of simulates as best as I can do, you know, what it might be like to work on a team developing a product together.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.240
That's cool.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.020
Do you teach them any, like, source control, like GitHub or anything like this?

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.340
No, I don't.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.000
I haven't gone there yet.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.220
It's sort of on my list of things to figure out how to work in.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.300
So, yeah.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.780
Some of them have been to summer camps and whatnot where they've learned that.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.720
It is kind of a hard thing to explain to them.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.060
But, yeah, it's on my list to get to at some point.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.060
Yeah, of course.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.860
Well, there's always the challenge of, like, you want to show them everything.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.020
But if you do that, then they'll learn nothing, right?

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:11.920
Right, right.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.780
They just get overwhelmed and freak out.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.140
Nice.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.340
And so, you know, it's really cool that you start with Python.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.300
And it seems like they get basically two years of Python.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.080
Year and a half-ish.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.520
Year and a half.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.260
Okay, year and a half.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.060
The second one is a semester, right?

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:27.620
Yeah.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.260
Yeah, cool.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.700
So they get a year and a half of Python.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.820
And then they move on to other topics.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.200
And are those still in Python?

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.040
Not all of them, right?

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.720
Not all of them.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.520
I am teaching this year for the first time a web design and development class, which is kind of funny since that's my background.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.320
It took me five years to get to teach that course.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:52.380
So it's happening this year, which obviously they could use Python for.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.520
I am going to teach them JavaScript.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:03.760
But I've already told them that, you know, if they prefer working in Python and want to go in that direction, I'll make sure everything's set up for them so that they can do that.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:13.840
And I've had some students do some things in Python just for the heck of it, which is always kind of fun.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.100
But yeah, so that's that course.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:26.580
And then I also have a physical computing course and a mobile computing course, which I don't do Python for either of those.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.660
Those are C-based courses.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.620
Okay.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.120
Yeah.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.520
That's sort of the senior level type things, right?

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:32.960
Exactly.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.420
Yep.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:33.960
Yep.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.500
They actually have advanced topics in front of them.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.640
So, yeah.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.080
Yeah.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.820
They're ready for compilers, semicolons, and curly braces, I guess.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.740
Exactly.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.860
Exactly.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.540
And pointers.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.000
Maybe that's more the hard part.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.700
Right.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.360
Right.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:59.680
This episode is brought to you by Hired.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:06.160

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.660
Ever.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.760
Sounds pretty awesome, doesn't it?

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.820
Well, did I mention there's a signing bonus?

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.920
Everyone who accepts a job from Hired gets a $2,000 signing bonus.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.260

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.540
Opportunity's knocking.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.160
Visit Hired.com slash Talk Python To Me and answer the call.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.360
Okay.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.700
So, in the physical computing one, this is like sort of the Internet of Things.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:02.140
Is that right?

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:02.540
Yep.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.160
Exactly.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.780
What do you guys do with the girls there?

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.740
So, we, it's mostly Arduino based.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:14.720
So, I have, you know, a collection of Arduinos and accessories.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:20.120
And we also have a fully stocked, all of our, this just happened over the summer.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.840
My classroom is now fully stocked with anything they might want to build.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.500
I have a laser cutter and a CNC machine and two 3D printers.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:34.820
So, the idea is that they would, you know, come up with a project that requires some sort of programming.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:41.960
And then create the thing that the Arduino is going to live in using all that other equipment.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.320
Oh, that is so cool.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:43.920
Yeah.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.520
Yeah.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.960
It's been pretty fun.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.360
I didn't get to teach it last year because there weren't enough of me to go around.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.800
So, I had to hire somebody else this year.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.160
So, that worked out well.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:01.000
So, last year, I had one of my favorite projects that didn't quite get completed.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.840
And that's the other thing that happens in the physical computing class especially is that we just sometimes don't finish.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.420
They're too ambitious.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:18.320
So, one student made, wanted to make a pet rock that took, that had its own Twitter account.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:24.480
And it would take tweets and then decide what the mood of those tweets were.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:32.000
And then display on a little LED matrix, you know, a happy face or a frowny face or something like that.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.060
So, that's pretty awesome.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:34.800
Yeah.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.600
It was pretty awesome.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.100
The hard part about that is working with Twitter.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.820
So, that was a big challenge.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.800
She got the LED matrix to change its face.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.880
And she got, on occasion, the Twitter thing to work, but she couldn't get them to work together.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.720
So, it was a little challenging.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.120
Yeah.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.720
That's a pretty ambitious project.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.580
It was.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.840
Especially if it's done in C.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.020
Yeah.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.680
Exactly.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:06.260
I think it's really cool that you have these 3D printers and laser cutters and so on to actually make the things.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:14.620
Because the Internet of Things, so much of it, when people get started, it seems like, okay, well, here you're left with kind of this, like, board with wires coming out of it.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.220
Right.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:15.780
Right.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.480
And how does that feel like I really built a thing?

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.140
That's not a thing.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.660
That's a board with wires coming out of it, right?

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:20.940
Right.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:21.580
Yeah.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:21.680
Yeah.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.340
And, yeah, so, my goal is for them to make it look pretty by the end.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.560
Or at least, you know, not like a board with wires coming out of it.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.280
And most of them got there.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:36.620
They all created, you know, some sort of housing for their project.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.320
Some of them made it out of cardboard.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.240
I didn't have a laser cutter at the time, but I did have a 3D printer.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:47.100
So, I had a 3D printed, like, music box thing that turned out really well.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.780
Yeah.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.760
So, they do make that part.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:57.760
It's nice because they can actually, when they get frustrated with the coding, they can say, all right, I'm just going to, you know, start working on the housing.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.320
Because that's, you know, it gives them a little bit of a break.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:01.680
Yeah.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.020
Let's them focus on different things.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:03.500
That's really cool.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:03.700
Yeah.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.300
Yeah.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.920
By the way, I have a movie recommendation if you want to inspire them for 3D printing.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:18.520
There's a documentary that just came out called Print the Legend, which is actually super dramatic about the history of, like, how MakerBot got formed and the other competitive ones.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.740
So, let's check that out.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.840
If you're the listeners, I think it would be helpful.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.500
Yeah, that's great.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.320
Yeah, surprisingly dramatic.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:25.900
Okay.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:32.160
And the other thing that you teach these girls is iPhone and Android development.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.100
Yeah.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.480
Which is, that's the hardest thing for me.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.780
Because, of course, there was no internet when I went to school.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.500
And there was definitely no mobile phones when I went to school.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:41.960
Sure.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.580
So, yeah, there was, so I'm constantly changing the language for that.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:52.540
We're mostly, I mean, I personally have an Android, but most of my students mostly have iPhones.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.420
You know, Apple basically owns my student population for whatever reason.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:04.020
So, I could use, you know, Objective-C, but it just, it's hard.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.620
It's super hard, yeah.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:12.580
Yeah, and a lot of times I will get students who've only had the intro, and so throwing them into something like that is a challenge.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:20.920
So, I'm still thinking about what I'm going to, what language I'm going to use or what framework, really, I'm going to use for that.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:39.680
And I'm looking at possibly using TouchDevelop as, because it's browser-based, it's cross-platform, and that's another challenge I have is, you know, for the students who aren't iPhone people, what if they want to put their, you know, new create game on their phone?

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.660
And if you use any of Apple's development things, you're stuck with just the iPhone.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.760
Right, and if you want to say, well, we're going to teach you Apple and then teach you Android, that's all of a sudden, like, way too much material to cover.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.080
Exactly.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.720
Because there's not a whole lot of similarities.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.180
No, right.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.040
I mean, yeah, Java, C, I know, so.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:05.640
Yeah, I mean, there's other stuff like Xamarin and PhoneGap, and they're all okay, but it would be nice if Python had an answer there.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.860
There's something, like, Kivy for Android, but not really on Apple, like you said, and that's where the majority of the students are, so.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:24.260
Yeah, yeah, it is a challenge, and it's one of those, the other thing that's a challenge about it is that because, actually, Python and some of the other stuff we work with has kind of instant gratification,

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:31.120
the mobile development doesn't have that instant gratification, and it feels painful to them.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:40.300
So, they have been good sports about it, but it is, it's not as, yeah, instantly gratifying as animating something in Python, for example.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.940
Yeah, definitely not as developer-friendly.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:42.780
Yeah.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:54.160
I guess the counterbalance there to keep them going is they all have phones, and I have, you know, teenage daughters myself, and they love phones, and so, you know, if they could program that thing, that would be perfect for them, right?

00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:05.080
Yeah, well, and that's part of why I wanted to look at TouchDevelop is that you can program right on your phone in addition to the browser or any other way that you might program, so that's kind of cool.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:21.360
One thing I wanted to ask you about as well as sort of a more general question is it seems like you guys are treating computer science, you know, really well, actually, as a core skill that you think at least recommend all the girls have.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:21.580
Yeah.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.740
Do you think computer science and programming is a core skill?

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:32.480
I mean, you hear a lot of, like, hype in the news, like, everybody should learn to code, sort of like the main way I hear it, but what are your thoughts?

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:45.140
Yeah, so I'm also on the board of the Computer Science Teachers Association, so I definitely think that, you know, computer science should be part of our core curriculum in some way.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:50.080
It's hard to figure out how to get that into schools.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.580
I mean, schools' budgets are super tight.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:58.760
You know, there aren't computer science teachers walking around looking for jobs.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:05.060
It's not like there's a glut of them and that we can just say, oh, there's a whole pool of teachers.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.980
Let's just hire them and have them teach our computer science courses.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.280
They're all going to work at, you know, startups.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.280
That's right.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.720
These guys are tired of making six figures at these exciting places.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.300
They want to come in, you know, whatever.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.140
It has got to be a hard place to hire people.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:19.600
It is.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.940
It's very much a chicken and egg problem.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:27.680
It's like if we have the courses, could we fill those courses with teachers?

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:34.420
And, you know, we don't have the courses, so there's not demand created for the teachers.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.760
So it's just like a really complicated problem.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:49.100
But I think we're getting there in that a lot of states are starting, you know, to make, allow computer science to count as a math or science credit, which is nice.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.600
It's Pennsylvania, where I am, has not done that yet.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:59.660
And even though I'm in a private school, I'm surrounded by these fantastic public schools.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:10.920
And so I can guarantee as soon as our state flips to say that computer science is required, we would be right behind them in requiring a computer science course for all of our students.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.620
Or allowing it to count for math or science, whichever way it goes.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.380
Right.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.600
You guys already have the infrastructure there to just say, hey, it's required now, right?

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:19.780
Right.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:20.860
Because you've been teaching it.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:26.000
It's not like a school where they have, you know, maybe an HTML class, maybe.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.440
Right.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.980
Or Photoshop or, you know, a robotics elective.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.440
Those are some of the common things they're done.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.900
And it's hard because I think computer science is such a broad field.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.920
If you're in it, you know that.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.180
If you're not in it, you think it's just one thing.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.100
It's just coding.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:47.680
And maybe even in a specific language as opposed to the, I don't know how many languages there are now.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.560
There are probably several hundred programming languages.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.440
So, you know, most people have no clue that that's the case.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:04.700
So they, you know, defining what would be that required course, I think, is kind of the hard thing for people who have no idea what computer science is.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.040
Right.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.800
If you could convince them that this is a thing they need, then they'd be like, well, geez, where do we start?

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.760
It's so overwhelming, right?

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.400
Right.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:10.960
It is.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.280
Yeah.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:12.320
Yeah.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:27.720
And I think, you know, and I do, even though the core of my courses is coding and programming, we take an awful lot of time to also just kind of talk about some of the theory of computer science as much as I think that they can get as 14-year-olds.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.900
You know, we talk about algorithms and we talk about, you know, different kinds of algorithms.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.380
And we spend a lot of time talking about how it touches their lives.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:46.220
I mean, it's great when you can talk about an algorithm and connect it to Facebook's algorithm for, you know, showing and hiding different parts of your news feed.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.320
And then there's all the fun, you know, hacking that happens that always comes up.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:32:01.400
So, you know, it's pretty easy to connect it to the real world and then talk about the things that they've already learned that are somewhat related to what's going on.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:08.080
You know, if you've done an encryption project, then you sort of know how those hacking things happen.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:22.400
I think there's some sort of, not barriers, some preconceptions or misconceptions rather that a lot of the population has that if we could break them, this would really change.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.080
Like, for example, computer programming is boring and not creative.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:27.980
Right.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:33.120
It's a non-social thing you go do in the basement by the dark because you don't like other people.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.360
I mean, you know, it's completely the opposite of that in today's world, right?

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:43.100
And if everybody saw that and they could, I don't know, you could think, well, maybe should we be doing geometry?

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.240
Right, right.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:53.400
Or should, maybe we should be teaching programming in this slot where geometry about logical thinking through, like, axioms was the goal, right?

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.160
It would be so much better, I think, to do some sort of computer thinking there.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:14.360

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:50.100
I agree.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.760
Yeah.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.680
I mean, it's funny because, you know, I mentioned that my major was creative writing.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:01.720
And I swear, programming is a much more creative endeavor than writing poetry in a lot of ways.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.580
It sounds weird.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.440
And poetry is very isolating.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:10.600
You know, you're in a room, you're writing poems, and maybe eventually someone reads them or you read them to someone.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:16.120
But, you know, when you're making a website, everyone's going to see it.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:22.460
You know, you put it up on the web and you make it public and you can tweet it and put it on Facebook and everyone can see it.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.120
And that's pretty cool.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.000
Yeah.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:34.460
It's very, there's very few other places in the world that five people can get together for six months and build something and share it with 100 million people.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.100
Right.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:35.660
Yeah.

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:37.220
Where else does that happen?

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:37.740
Yeah.

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.200
Nowhere.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:38.920
Nowhere.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.320
So it's really amazing.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:51.460
So I think what you're doing there with having, you know, that much exposure over time, do you, I should ask you, do you feel like your students are coming out with better conceptions?

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:52.860
I do.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:35:03.800
I think that they definitely feel like it's not isolating and it's not lonely and that they're making really creative and interesting things.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:09.160
Hopefully they're carrying that on to their classmates and beyond.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.520
Certainly I've seen an increase in enrollment.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:22.460
So that probably tells me that they're telling their friends that it's really cool and fun and not, you know, boring and awful the way that, you know, TV and film tends to make it look.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:37.120
So, yeah, I think my hope is that when they graduate and go on and not all of them, you know, just like math teachers don't expect all their students to become mathematicians.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.760
I don't expect all my students to necessarily become computer scientists.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:36:04.120
But I think having that deeper understanding of technology that goes beyond, you know, being able to post to Facebook is really important because I have yet to find a job or area or field that doesn't benefit from having that deeper understanding of technology, of how things really work under the hood.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:21.440
You know, I keep getting pulled into things just here locally at school because I'm one of, you know, two people on campus that has that deeper understanding of, you know, how a database works and how it connects to the web and how, you know, that gets pulled in different places.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:28.340
And I can't think of a single field or job that technology isn't important.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.480
It's how businesses operate, you know.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.020
It absolutely is.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:41.960
And if, you know, if somebody wants to become a biologist, they're way more likely to be successful if they can do a little programming to automate their data analysis.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.380
Exactly.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:48.120
Or if they want to become, I don't know, a social scientist, right?

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.820
Like a sociologist, psychiatrist, something like, again, the programming.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:54.240
Yeah, you've got to crunch the data.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:54.720
Exactly.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:03.280
And I think CS probably is a core skill, at least as much as geometry and those things are.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:03.740
Yeah.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.900
Absolutely.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.660
That's my thought.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:07.840
Me too.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.380
I'm with you.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.360
Let's change the world.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.300
Let's do it.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:10.740
Let's do it.

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:16.820
So one event that I wanted to ask you about that's about changing the world that is making a small dent is Hour of Code.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.220
Are you guys doing anything with that?

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.900
Yeah, we are.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:30.840
I just bought off of eBay about 400 or 500 punch cards to use as invitations for our Hour of Code.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.720
We have done different things in the past.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:41.460
We've done an evening event and invited people and we have them kind of learn how to code and we actually have the students do the teaching.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.680
We're going to do it a little bit differently this time.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:51.220
We're going to have it be a whole day event on a weekend when more people can make it.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:38:00.300
It's a terrible time of year to have it because it's December and up here in the north anyway, the weather can interfere with anything you might have planned.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.640
But we're going to run a three-hour workshop.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:15.980
We have a partnership with Tech Girls, which is a local organization that provides free workshops for middle school girls to learn programming primarily.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.860
So we have taught a few of those ourselves.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.580
We offer our space as a resource for them.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:28.320
And we're going to partner with them specifically for CS Education Week and have them.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.080
We're running a workshop for their population.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:39.100
And then we're going to have a showcase afterwards of both the projects that get created in that workshop and the projects that our students have created.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:42.860
And we're hoping to have a speaker and food and all that good stuff.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.260
That's really awesome.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.860
Are you looking for volunteers?

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.100
Probably, yeah.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.060
Yeah, cool.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:53.600
So if you're in the Boston area, maybe think about throwing your name out there.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:58.320
You know, I live in Portland, Oregon, even though I'm spending a year in Germany, right?

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.060
And so I've been helping out my – I have three daughters.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.340
I've been helping out their school during the Hour of Code.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.360
Oh, cool.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.920
And it was just so successful.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.740
I think the teachers and the principals were just blown away with what the kids could do.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.340
Even first graders were just amazing.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:26.560
And when you're working at first grade, second grade, third grade, those levels, there's no difference in the way that the girls or the boys perceive it in terms of excitement or energy or whatever.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:33.220
Like something happens later, but if we can, you know, drive that interest early, then, you know, I think that could make a big difference.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.580
I agree, yeah.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.620
I guess regardless of where you are, you know, think about helping out the Hour of Code.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:41.300
There's Hour of Code, which is December 8th, around then.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:46.680
You know, there's so many resources out there that you don't have to put much effort into it, right?

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:56.380
You can go over to the Hour, you know, code.org, find some sort of pre-built, like, you know, teaching thing for the right level and just help kids through it is really all people got to do, right?

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.260
Yeah.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:01.160
I mean, it's just, yeah, running them through it, letting them see what they can do.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.040
And there's, yeah, like you said, there's so many resources online now, which is great.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.840
Yeah.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.800
It's definitely easier than when we were learning back in the day.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.120
Yes.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:09.560
Yeah.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.280
Yeah.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.800
You don't have to drag the book out.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.740
That's right.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:13.800
Look stuff up.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.340
Laura, is there anything else you want to cover before we kind of wrap things up?

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.360
I don't think so.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.640
This has been great.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:27.220
I mean, if we can get Python to come up with a mobile computing platform, that'll solve all my problems.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.260
I can just stay in Python forever.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.520
That would be fantastic.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.800
You know, it's not completely insane, right?

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.660
We've got things like PyPy, which are JIT compiled Python.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:43.020
If we could switch the JIT compiler to an ahead-of-time compiler and get it to compile towards the right thing, right?

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:48.200
Maybe we could have us a model what the Xamarin guys are doing with C#, right?

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.100
Yeah, exactly.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:52.360
Which isn't natively allowed on iPhone, but they've found a way to compile it for it.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.600
So we can hope, right?

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.820
We can hope.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.240
I don't have time to work on that, but I'm going to put that out there.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.340
Somebody else can do it.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.140
Yeah, so we'll throw the idea out.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:01.520
How's that?

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.660
That sounds good.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:02.900
Awesome.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.840
So let me ask you two quick questions before you go.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.900
For Python, what's your favorite editor?

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.260
I have to say, I kind of like PyCharm.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.380
It's been nice.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:20.400
Although I tend to work on the web a lot, so I'm using just your basic text editor for that.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.860
Right, some kind of web IDE or a sort of smart text editor, rather.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:25.720
Exactly.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.180
I like color coding.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.360
It's kind of my favorite thing.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.940
At least in syntax highlighting.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:30.300
Awesome.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:37.360
And then are there like PyPI packages that you guys use that are really awesome you want to point out or raise awareness of?

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.480
What do you guys do in your classes that's really cool and well-received?

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:46.080
We've used NumPy a little bit or NumPy, depending on how you want to say it.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.020
I like NumPy myself.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:52.920
It just sounds like it's a soft, fuzzy, like, you know, Barney creature.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:58.300
Students went a little nuts with the libraries last year, and they're just downloading crazy stuff.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.280
They really were.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:05.240
They probably downloaded 10 or so random libraries just to try to get stuff off the Internet.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:11.560
We used, and I can't remember what it was, we used a couple of different Twitter packages that worked pretty well,

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:16.040
which was nice considering our Arduino Twitter packages didn't work.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.140
So Python wins in that regard.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.400
They worked great.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.580
We were able to pull tweets really easily.

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.820
I think there's a tweet.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.420
Is it Tweepy?

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.140
I think that was the one we ended up using.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:26.880
Okay, cool.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.160
Yeah, people should check that out if they want to integrate with Twitter.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.240
Yeah, Twitter can be tricky if you don't have, you know, all that OAuth stuff.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.840
It's way more complicated than it sort of seems like it should be at first.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.700
Yeah.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.780
Well, this we got running in like five minutes, so it was pretty easy.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.880
Yeah, that's the way to do it.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.660
Laura, this has been really interesting.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.900
So I think you guys have a great mission, and it seems like you're making great progress.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:55.540
There's almost no other high school I've seen that has, you know, four years of really interesting, modern-feeling computer science classes.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.800
Well, thank you.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.760
Thanks for putting that out there and leading the way.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.280
Yeah, thanks a lot.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.900
Yeah, thanks for being on the show.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:02.440
Talk to you later.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.300
All right.
