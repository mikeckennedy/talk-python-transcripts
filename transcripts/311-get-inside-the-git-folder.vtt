00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.980
These days, Git is synonymous with source control itself.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.040
Rare are the current debates of whether to use Git versus SVN versus some fossil like

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.500
SourceSafe versus you name it, but do you know how Git works? What about its internals?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.020
I'm sure you've seen a .git folder in your project's root, but to most folks, that's a black

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.080
box. In this episode, you'll meet Rob Richardson. He's going to pop the lid on that black box as we

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.300
dive into Git internals and the .git folder, among other things about source control.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.800
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 311, recorded April 1st, 2021.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:51.000
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.520
ecosystem, and the personalities. This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Twitter where

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.120
I'm at mkennedy, and keep up with the show and listen to past episodes at talkpython.fm,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.460
and follow the show on Twitter via at Talk Python. Congratulations to Mike Manning. He's the final

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.880
winner of our PyCon ticket giveaway. Thank you to everyone who entered, and if you didn't win,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.600
I hope you're able to get a ticket and support the PSF, the Python community, and be part of that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.200
awesome conference. See you in May. Rob, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.720
So glad to be here. I'm really excited that I get to join you. Great to meet your audience.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.380
Yeah, it's great to have you here. You got to meet Intersection. You gave a talk at the Python

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.440
web conference recently that I also spoke at, and your talk was really interesting and certainly

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.220
relevant to the Python folks, so I thought it'd be cool to have you over here. And, you know,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.100
I should give credit to Paul Everett for connecting us. He's like, oh, that was a great talk. You should

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.240
go talk to Rob. So thanks, Paul, as well, who was not long ago on the show.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.100
Yeah. I've been chatting with Paul about thoughts around the talk as well. He's a really brilliant

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.360
guy.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.940
Yeah, he is. He definitely is. He's been doing a lot of cool stuff for a long time. So yeah,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.380
he's a great guy. Now, before we get into Git and all those types of things, which, you know,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.940
it's really surprising to me how much it's taken over the world, right? It used to be,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.840
there was always a question, well, what source control do you use? Like, that's not a question

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.380
I hear all that often these days, not at least as much as it used to be. But before we dive into the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.960
details of that, let's start with your story. How'd you get into programming?

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.580
This is actually a really fun story. I was 10. I was at the library because they had the computer

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.720
and we'd play video games. And the methodology of how you do this is you go up to the counter and you

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.020
flip through the book and you go find the video game and you show them that page and they give you the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.480
disc and you have the save icon. You take the save icon and you put it in the computer and you play the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.320
game. So I had finished playing my game and I went back to the desk to go pick another

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.680
one flipping through the, you know, plastic sheets. And I found a drawing program. And I said,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.880
I'd like to play this game. They gave me an eight and a half by 11 sheet of paper. The top two thirds

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.580
was graph paper, you know, graphs. And the bottom third was how to write the program to draw that on

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.900
screen. Oh, cool. Okay.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:13.860
And it was so much fun. I got to start to build content that was in my mind in real life in this

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.020
artistic medium with a very technical implementation. So, you know, that was so much fun. I did never

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.120
return that game. And so that kind of brought me into the world of software development. I always

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.940
thought it was just a fun thing that people did. I didn't realize it was a career. So it wasn't until

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.080
really late in my college experience when I realized that I could do this for a career.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.760
And so after I graduated, I got into programming professionally and I've had a really fun time

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.540
coding now for professionally for more than 20 years.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.000
Yeah. Awesome. I think programming is special because it's one of those things you kind of

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.600
hinted at where you, you think of something, you dream of something, you imagine something.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.620
And then with a little bit more thinking, that thing can become real. Whereas, you know, so much

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.520
of what humans do, it's one or the other. I could tell an amazing story and write the book,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.740
or I could go build an awesome house. But normally those things don't actually coexist where you think

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.440
a lot about something and they come into existence. But I do think that's a magical part of what we get

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.520
to do. And I think it captures a lot of people's imagination.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.220
And what's really cool is that in this digital world, there are a lot less boundaries, a lot

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.680
less constraints. There's nothing telling me that this pixel needs to be in this certain way.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.680
I can draw whatever I want on these pixels on the screen.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.920
Yeah. Yeah. And modern day, we have cloud computing and we have incredible computers. Like

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.380
the sky's the limit. It's really, really awesome. Also money. You don't have to go buy tons of hardware

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.020
for many things that we do. Right. So really cool. Now, how about today? What are you up to these days?

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.280
I'm doing a lot with software development, cloud-based development, a lot of websites,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.020
a lot of web properties, ASP.net and Node on the backend, React and Vue on the front end.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.840
Taking that into interesting modalities, I've started to play with Raspberry Pis and that's

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.800
really fun. And getting to dig into all the things. I've gotten really good at doing DevOps as well.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.840
Part of my passion is being able to share this knowledge with others. So I do a lot with teaching

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.680
both at user groups and conferences and elsewhere mentoring. And so it's really fun to be able to

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.520
not only learn these new skills, but also pass it on to the next generation of developers too.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.120
I love to say that it's not that I'm really good at it. It's just that I've been collecting things for a

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.320
while. So let me add to your collection too.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.760
Well, I think one of the things that's really interesting about becoming an expert in programming,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.320
people who are beginners or maybe don't do programming at all, they see that person as

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.700
incredibly talented and incredibly smart. And they may be, they often are, but I feel like the real

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.180
big difference is I've spent 10 years gathering up these little tips. Like, oh, I tried this.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.780
That doesn't work very well. That crashes. You try to talk to the database that way. That's bad. Oh,

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.900
by the way, I've also built up a couple of examples of what databases are. And I've seen,

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:11.180
you just have this almost more experience than, I don't know, like innate skill, right? So it's

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.500
really cool. You can just kind of layer on these skills over your career. And the reason I think

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.960
that's powerful is it's, they're very easy to communicate back to other people, right? If,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:28.720
you know, the way Nietzsche did philosophy or the way Euler did math, like you can't, or Bach did music,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.340
like you can't easily communicate that to someone. Like if it's this crazy innate skill,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.020
you can sort of communicate it, but it's not the same. But with programming, I think it's very easy

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.340
to transmit it on and pass it on and ways to help people like level up. It's super fun.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.380
And it's really easy to get started. You know, programming languages have become much more

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.160
approachable of late. And so if you're new to programming and just starting to dabble in it,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.820
you don't need to buy a big expensive thing. You know, the laptop that you're using to browse the

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.500
web is probably sufficient for building simple programs. And so, you know, dive in,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.460
use free tools and just start building stuff. It's really approachable and really fun.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.080
It absolutely is. And one of the things that just never ceases to blow my mind is I can be in a coffee

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:20.980
shop working on a relatively cheap laptop doing my coding. Git push, speaking of Git, something happens

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.480
on one part of the cloud. It triggers a web hook somewhere else that then grabs the code and could run

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:31.340
that on a tremendously powerful data center and computer or suite of computers, a cluster of

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.880
computers. And yet I get the experience of basically building this super powerful thing on my very wimpy

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:43.220
little laptop. It's just cool that you can create things like Facebook or Google, or you name these,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.640
these really large, amazing apps, but you could kind of just do it on like a laptop.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:56.300
Something that existed in my mind yesterday exists in the cloud and scaled to any user that wants it

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.920
tomorrow. Yeah. That is really fun.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.540
Yeah. It's super, super fun. Before we move on, you also mentioned that you've been playing around with

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.400
Raspberry Pi.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:11.400
So, something that I covered recently on Python Bytes, my other podcast, is somebody built a water-cooled

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:20.080
Raspberry Pi cluster computer. So, eight Raspberry Pis in one thing, all of them overclocked and water-cooled.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.280
Have you seen people doing this stuff? It's crazy.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.760
It's really cool. And as you start to get into clustering programming, clustered programming, you know,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:34.680
multi-machine type of experiences, a Raspberry Pi is a really cheap barrier to entry. You know, for $40 or so,

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:41.580
you can get a Raspberry Pi, get three or four or five of them, cluster them together, and now you get the sense of

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:51.260
what does it take to build parallel machinery. And it is really, really fun. So, you know, to get an eight or ten or a hundred or a thousand,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.080
node Raspberry Pi is pretty sweet.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:01.540
Yeah, that's awesome. I mean, you can do something similar with Docker, right? Fire up a bunch of Docker containers, but it's not the same

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:06.940
feeling as like, there's actually eight of them over there, and they're actually talking to each other and working together. I think it's a very

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.340
different feeling. It's super cool.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:19.560
Containers do help us start to approximate that. But yeah, there is some lying to ourselves to believe that all of these containers running in context on my one laptop are really a

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:26.620
distributed system. Yeah, absolutely. It's not the same, but it does let you sort of play around there a bit. Right. All right. So I want to talk about Git

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:35.800
primarily, and that's what your presentation at the Python web conference was about. And that's what we're going to center our conversation on. But you know, you and I have both been around the

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.860
industry for a lot of different things.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:38.860
Yeah.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:10:01.800
So maybe let's talk a little bit about the history of source control. You know, I think of source control as a spectrum from what source control all the way to get and distributed source control. Maybe, you know, there's, I've talked to people and I've seen it in action. Source control is I've got a file code file,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:18.260
and I've called it version one version two version two edited version three version three final final two, you know, just like, or maybe if it's a lot of files, you zip the folder and you name it like that. Right. Like that's the beginning of source control. He's doing it wrong, but it's getting getting there. Right.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:38.140
Well, it's doing it in exactly the way that you needed at that time. Copy folder versioning is definitely a thing. Dot bu dot date, you know, copy that content off to make sure that you have it. And that's really what we're after with version control is when we think of version control, we're really talking about two things.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:51.640
One is archiving the history of my journey so that I can get back to a known good state if things go bad, but also communicating with my team to be able to convey the progress of this system.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:52.340
Yeah.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:11:11.220
And copy folder versioning does the first one real well. It doesn't do the second one real well. There are systems that I've worked on where, you know, to upgrade the system is to first copy all the things into the dot backup folder and then upgrade the primary thing. And if it doesn't work correctly, then you point the...

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.340
Put it back, put it back, put it back, put it back.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:30.060
Yeah. They point the web server at the backup folder. And so now the system has been running out of the backup folder for, you know, six or eight months or a year. And now we go to upgrade and step one is to take, oh, wait, we just took down the site. Now we have no known good backup thing.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:40.300
Yeah. Without some sort of source control, the real thing I think that falls apart, maybe you're doing the file versioning thing, which is still not that ideal, but the thing that really falls apart is collaboration.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:49.560
Right. Soon as two people want to work on something, it's not okay to say, well, here's my zip version. Can you merge that back together? And probably you don't have merge tools either. So what does that even mean? Right.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:12:06.440
So I quickly gets us into where I think people probably should be in some sort of version control, but back in the day, that was different stuff. For example, you know, maybe that was subversion. Actually, if you were on subversion, you were in a good place. I mean, a really good place.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:21.360
Yeah. Subversion was really cool. Subversion was an upgrade to CVS where CVS would version each file or each folder separately. And so nested folders just happened to kind of be together in this clump.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:35.000
And what subversion gave us was we're versioning the entire project together in one piece. Before that, we might've had source safe or other pieces. Team foundation server kind of fits into this realm as well.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:49.820
And so it's that mechanism of versioning all of the pieces together and then being able to publish that to a central place. What makes all of these systems kind of unique, specific is that they're all really client server pieces.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.500
So version was really good at being a client server piece.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:59.440
I'm going to go out on a limb and say it was the best client server version control system that I'm aware of.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:12:59.800
Yeah.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.480
I think so.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.800
These systems though, kind of a fundamental flaw because we want to use version control for those two pieces.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:13.900
We want to use it to be able to back up the work so that I can get back to a known good state and to communicate with our team.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:22.020
And the hard part with these client server version control systems is we're doing both every time we commit.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:28.300
So when I commit a change to subversion, I'm immediately publishing it to all of you.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:38.360
So the analogy that I like is when I'm rock climbing, I want to be able to put a carabiner in the wall as frequently as possible.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.380
If I climb a foot and I fall, I'm only going to fall a foot.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.000
If I climb six or eight or 12 feet and I fall, I'm going to fall 12 feet.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.800
Well, actually the nature of the rope is that it's going to swing all the way down.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.560
So I fall 24 feet and that's a long way to go.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.240
I want to stick pieces in the wall as frequently as I can.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.240
You don't want to see me spamming the thing every time I get there.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.500
So I get to the point where it's like, okay, I finished the thought.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.060
I'm good.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.700
I want to mark this save point, but I'm not ready to publish it to all of you.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:20.220
Yeah, because really the thing you should be working with most of the time is if I publish it to the rest of the team, it should be, it should at least run.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.020
Right.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:21.500
Yeah.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.460
Probably the test should pass.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.000
Maybe you can fix that.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.940
Like you're going to work with somebody, but it shouldn't just mean nobody can build or even start the software at all.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:37.140
Because you've got the save point in the middle of their work that is inconsistent or halfway there or whatever.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:37.440
Right.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.660
And so I've reached the stopping point, but I'm not done.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.480
It doesn't work.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.700
And so I have this moral dilemma.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.560
Do I mark a save point and inflict that on all of you or do I not?

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:58.980
And that's when I fall back to a secondary version control system where I start doing copy folder versioning again, where it's like, I just want to take all my stuff and stick it in this spot so that I have this known good state.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:10.120
And that's where we pivot to distributed version control systems of which Git is one of them, where we have a separation between the commit stage and the publish stage.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:18.260
And that isn't the official terms that Git or any of the rest of them use, but there's a process of marking those save points.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.880
And then there's a process of collecting all of the save points and publishing them to others.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:29.640
It takes a bit of a mind shift to get used to it as well when you're working on it, because if you come from one of these other systems, I committed, so it's saved.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.680
Right.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:41.300
But commit in a distributed source control system means it's a local save point until you Git push or whatever other immacterial's equivalent of a Git push is.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:41.500
Right.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:41.940
Yeah.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.880
An HG push.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.660
And so it's exactly that.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:52.760
It's marking save points however frequently you want and then combining those save points together into a cohesive story.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.580
To publish to your colleagues.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:16:00.300
And that's what makes distributed version control so powerful is separating those two concepts.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.580
Mercurial, Git, Perforce.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.960
There are other distributed version control systems.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:14.340
And as the world was moving from subversion and TFS into this distributed world, we experimented with each of them.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.760
You know, arguably Git wasn't the best.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.500
We might have done a VHS and Betamax type of thing.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.320
But clearly Git has become the de facto standard version control system.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.480
It is distributed.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.060
And now we can separate the save points from the publish points.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.620
Talk Python to me is partially supported by our training courses.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.040
At Talk Python, we run a bunch of web apps and web APIs.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.360
These power the training courses as well as the mobile apps on iOS and Android.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.120
If I had to build these from scratch again today, there's no doubt which framework I would use.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.120
It's FastAPI.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.100
To me, FastAPI is the embodiment of modern Python and modern APIs.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.740
You have beautiful usage of type annotations.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.240
You have model binding and validation with Pydantic.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.240
And you have first class async and await support.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:10.040
If you're building or rebuilding a web app, you owe it to yourself to check out our course, Modern APIs with FastAPI over at Talk Python Training.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.900
It'll take you from curious to production with FastAPI.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:21.420
To learn more and get started today, just visit talkpython.fm/FastAPI or email us at sales at talkpython.fm.

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:34.240
I think another really important thing to highlight for people who haven't been there, right at the Git homepage, they highlight Subversion, which we've been talking about.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:40.940
But Perforce, ClearCase, SourceSafe, TFS, a lot of these things, there's two things.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.440
One, they would lock files.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.400
Like if you wanted to make a change to a file, you would claim it.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:51.100
Like I'm editing main.py, well, no one else can interact with that file.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:56.020
It's literally made read-only on your computer until, you know, until that person is done.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.180
And they had better not forget and go on vacation while they got some files checked out.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.340
That's the one thing.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.580
The other is you need permission to participate in a project.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.180
You have these gatekeepers and you need to sort of prove yourself to the gatekeepers.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:14.540
So if I wanted to commit, I wanted to work on Flask, if it was under Subversion, I have to go.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.200
Can I have permission to go read, get read-only access to Flask?

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.680
If I want to make a change, I literally have to say I need permission to commit back to Flask.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:28.820
With the distributed ones, you clone it, you do your proof of work, your proposed idea.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:33.240
And if you want, you can contribute it back or you could just go in a different way, right?

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:39.800
There's this very interesting separation of I can kind of work on it and then see if I want to contribute

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.660
it back rather than the other way around.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.780
I have to get permission to contribute.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.960
And I think that's a super critical thing in the open source space where there's a very

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.800
loose coupling of people and projects.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.260
Like if somebody comes to me and says, I want to work on, I suppose I'm working on Flask.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.080
They come to me, I'm in charge of Flask.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.420
They come to me and say, I want to work on Flask.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.320
Like, well, maybe.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.000
What else have you done?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.500
Show me.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.460
This is a huge project.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.900
We do not want you to mess up Flask.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.600
But.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.100
And we had a little bit of that with SourceForge.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:16.240
You know, you could clone the repository in Subversion and just work on it locally, but you

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.340
weren't able to participate.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:22.680
The moment that you wanted to help, it was a really frictionful process where, you know,

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.000
okay, so I have this diff.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.020
Now, I don't have write permissions.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:31.220
So am I going to, you know, bake this diff into an email and hope somebody reads it?

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.400
Do I just use it locally?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.080
Do I fork the project and only have our corporate version of it?

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.320
You know, it was very difficult to participate.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:47.340
And that's not a feature of Git per se, but rather the GitHub, the shared hosted mechanism

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.400
around Git that has grown up as well.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:49.680
Yeah.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.680
I mean, with Git, you can clone a thing and then work on it as long as you have read access.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.560
But yeah, the additional mechanisms, the Git flow around it is certainly something created

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:06.160
by GitHub with like PRs and forks and the emerging upstreams and all that origin upstream stuff.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.080
One thing I did want to ask you before we get to the details is why do you think Git won?

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.940
You did talk about this Betamax, VHS sort of thing, and there are other options out there

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.200
for distributed source control.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.480
I have a theory, but what are your thoughts?

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.640
And I have a theory too.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:26.000
I don't have the answer and maybe our listeners will help us discover what the correct answer

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.220
is, or maybe there isn't one.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:33.060
In my mind, a lot of the time we were looking at ways to compete with things.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:38.360
You know, we had things that would compete with CFS or subversion because, you know,

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.900
we wanted a little bit more or we wanted to make money on the process of source control.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:48.260
And what's really interesting about Git is that it has become so pervasive.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:53.620
And so we're not building competitors to Git, we're building integrations into Git.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:53.820
All right.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.980
We're building on top of Git.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:55.160
Yeah.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.900
Now, arguably GitHub helped with that too.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.860
GitHub has a really, really powerful community mechanism for that.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.040
And GitHub really only did Git.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:11.560
But I would argue that Git is really cool because it's free and open source.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.660
And because it's free and open source and it has that community mechanism around it,

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.520
we don't need to compete with it.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.440
We don't need to try to make money on this.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:25.600
Instead, we can build collaborations with it and mechanisms working with it and build up the

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.360
community together.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.120
My thought as well was GitHub.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.540
Yeah.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:34.860
It's the thing that brought not just the server infrastructure to privately have code.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:40.100
It brought the community and it brought the flow that allowed people to collaborate in

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:45.940
ways that could let them collaborate once they've proven they have something to collaborate.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.160
Right.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.480
Here's my PR where I've already shown you the thing that's amazing that I want to offer up

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:50.920
to you.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.340
Well, that does look amazing.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:52.780
Thank you.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.180
Who are you?

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.240
Let's talk about this.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:54.440
Right.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.060
It's a different conversation than I've never seen you.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:02.020
Why should I give you right access to Blask on SVN?

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.120
And it's exactly that.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:09.220
GitHub has these magic levels to it where at the very first level, it is just an online

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.900
source code repository system.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:16.360
And so how is that different from SourceForge or TFS before it?

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.460
It isn't at this level.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.200
And so if that's what you're using GitHub for, then that's perfect.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:27.120
You know, back up your local projects up to GitHub, get your content off of your machine

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.400
in case there's a disaster.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.080
That is definitely the first level.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.600
The next level starts to build workflows around it where we can say, I want to create issues.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.240
I want to create project management things.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.960
I want to create milestones.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.260
I want to create goals.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.800
And so that's kind of the next level.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:49.380
Leveling up again, we can start to create a social community around that where we can start

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:56.580
to have conversations around the content where I can create a diff and we can all talk about

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.320
it and we can collaborate on it.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.140
And once it's good enough, now we can pull it in.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:06.580
Add to that then the mechanism around pull requests and things like that.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.760
Git has a concept of push and pull.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:15.400
You know, publish and receive, I guess, might be the terminology that matches here.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.840
And what's interesting about a pull request, I don't have right access to your repository,

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.800
but I want to contribute.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:28.700
So instead of pushing my content to you, I'm going to request that you pull it from me.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:35.400
And so no longer do I need to create this email and write out all the content and hope you read the email.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:43.000
I create this code up in my space and I request that you include it in your space.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.880
And that made collaborating with projects really, really easy.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:54.460
So with that comes the next level of GitHub where we have these communities that can socialize

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:59.560
and develop and hang out in this coding space.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:05.960
And that's really what made GitHub so magical is that we have this community around coding.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:11.780
Where previously with SourceForge or other environments, yeah, we had that online source control system,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.280
but we didn't have those levels of interaction.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.880
So pull requests or merge requests or whatever you're going to call it,

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:24.540
is that mechanism of being able to collaborate with low trust type of environments.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:30.740
I want to offer up my solution to the community and see if that's going to fit into this ecosystem.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.920
Yeah, I think that's why I get one as well.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.900
And Verda Rose out there says,

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.020
open source is the best way to learn and improve technically and collaborate with people you don't know.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.080
Yeah, and I think it's that the people that you don't know,

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:48.800
it makes it special because it allows you to create these connections with people all around the world

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.240
who you would otherwise not meet.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.500
And you get a chance to work with them.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:58.400
Even if you live in rural Canada and you want to do software development,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.900
maybe no one around you is really good at whatever you're trying to do,

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.700
but go to GitHub, find a project.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.620
You can collaborate with the best people in the world on that.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.440
We can create these communities around our passions for technology

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.240
or the problems that we want to solve,

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.200
not necessarily based on the geographic boundaries that we find ourselves in.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:15.900
Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.540
All right.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.340
So that's the history of it a little bit.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.920
I talked a little bit on why distributed source control is really powerful.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:30.100
And I think it has really unlocked open source in a special way and on a much larger scale than it has.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.440
And it is interesting to note that Git and GitHub are different.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.500
GitHub uses Git under the covers to be able to build its social experiences.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.020
But Git is a thing that is separate and distinct.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.020
There is no pull request concept in Git, for example.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:53.100
And with Git on your local machine in a cave, you can version and create those save points.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.900
When you're ready to socialize, to publish your content, to communicate with your team,

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:04.740
you can use Git together with lots of services, GitHub or Bitbucket or GitLab,

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:10.200
or there's lots of private services as well that allow you to create that online community.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.100
You know, GitHub has published their magic sauce to the world and lots of us have cloned it.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:20.060
So GitHub is still the place where we code for the most part.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.720
But if you prefer coding in another community, then that's totally fine.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:31.460
You can still use Git and all of the tools to be able to create your save points and publish that content to others.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.940
You could just publish it to a different server as well.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.400
Git and GitHub are different.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.420
It's easy to see them as the same thing.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.820
But yeah, they're absolutely not.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.920
We've got all these different locations.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:46.220
I have mixed emotions, mixed feelings about if you have another project and you put it somewhere else,

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.980
I'm not going to name any particular service, but let's just say somewhere that's not GitHub.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.540
That's totally good.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:57.120
But at the same time, so much of the open source flow is around GitHub and the stuff that's happening there.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.660
I don't know.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:03.300
It's just really interesting to think why you might be at one place and not the other place and so on.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:03.740
Yeah.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:10.840
And a lot of people were worried when GitHub was bought by Microsoft, is this going to be the end of the community collaboration?

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:22.920
And I think Microsoft has been a really good steward of the GitHub community and really making sure that GitHub is still available to all of us and facilitating the success of that ecosystem.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:23.260
Yeah.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:27.840
There was a lot of hesitancy and concern within certain communities.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.460
And I feel like they've done a great job.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.460
Yeah.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:36.800
What I didn't realize was that GitHub really needed some help from somebody.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.320
financially, they were not doing as well.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.040
And I looked at them like, oh, this place must be incredibly successful.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:49.480
But what came out after some of the reports and stuff, it was kind of important that someone came along.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.480
And if that's the case, then I was head over heels that Microsoft bought them.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.500
Last thing I want to see is them go away.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.580
And I think they've done a good job of just letting them be.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.520
Don't go mess with them.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.920
It's working really well.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.200
So I think it's been a good deal that worked out there.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:12.520
See also Docker for an example of a community that is amazing and contributing, but doesn't have a financial business model to be able to survive.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:12.880
Yeah.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.460
Yeah.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.300
Hopefully things go well for Docker, but it's just tricky.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.760
They tried the enterprise thing and then they're switching to other things.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.000
Yeah.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.340
I love their pivot back to focusing on developers in the community, which is wonderful.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:31.300
But I still feel like they haven't found their spot that allows them to be business successful.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:41.280
And the hard part is you can only do that for so long and then you need to pivot to something that can start to facilitate the business.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:41.980
Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.100
All right.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:47.840
Are you ready to go into the Git folder and find where the hidden magic lives?

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.900
Yes.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:57.300
If you go into a project that you've Git cloned or you've Git inited and you create some files and you mess around there, you don't see anything different.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.760
It looks just like any other folder that might have a project in it.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.000
Right.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:11.600
But in there actually is contained the almost the entire backup, the entire contents of all the versions of those files.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.420
At least every branch that you've checked out hidden in the hidden .git file.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.120
So .git on.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.260
And it's not almost.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:20.860
It is.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.580
That is the entire history of the project.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:32.280
So the way to back up a Git database, misusing that term, is to grab that .git folder and copy it.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:41.160
Inside that .git folder is lots of files that describe the history of the project since its inception down to the current version.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:48.080
And so, you know, kind of the only way that you can break Git is to open up that .git folder and change stuff.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.220
By default, this folder is hidden on most systems.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.740
So you may have to show hidden files and folders to be able to see the .git folder.

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:57.840
But it's there.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.480
And it's really powerful.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:29:59.800
Yeah.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.160
And so on Windows, you go to the Explorer, there's like one of those little ribbon things that drops down.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.820
It's a checkbox for show hidden folders and files.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:12.660
On macOS, I learned you can hit shift command dot and that will show hidden files.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.680
That I did not know.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.040
And I was very delighted when users told me about that.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.080
On Linux, I don't know.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.840
I mean, you can go and do an LL in there on the terminal.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.460
But there's probably some way to show it in the Explorer equivalent as well.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.260
You can navigate into it from your terminal or wherever.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.740
And once you're inside of it,

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.000
Yeah.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.300
All of the files are right there.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:31.520
Yeah.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:40.620
So we go in here and we find things like head, config, description, hooks, index, info, logs, objects, hacked, refs, and refs.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.620
You want to maybe give us a rundown of what each one of these are?

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:50.420
And then we can dive deeper with one of the tools that you built into maybe some of the things like refs and so on.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.140
But yeah, also maybe hooks.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.260
But yeah, wherever you want to start.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:58.180
What's cool in this database is it is the entire history of your project.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.140
And it's zlib compressed.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:12.140
So for example, the 20-year history of Perl, the .git folder is ever so slightly larger than the checkout folder.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:21.220
And that includes the entire history, including all of the changes and all of the authors and all of that is really nicely compressed into this folder.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:21.400
Wow.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.020
It breaks down into a couple of groups of things.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.340
We have the content.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:31.720
We have branches and tags, you know, references to the content.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:36.400
We have configuration details around this repository.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.720
We have index files.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.040
We have temp files.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.860
And then we have automation tools.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:46.540
And so these are kind of the groups of things that we'll find in this folder.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.160
A lot of them happen to be in their own folder, which is really nice.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.820
So for example, hooks is the place that you go for automation.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.860
Refs is the place where all of the content is.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.480
No, refs is the place for branches.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.140
Objects is the place for the content.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:06.440
And so a lot of the things that we'll see will have their own folder, but some of them spill out.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:12.900
Like configuration is in the config file, but there's also some stuff in the info folder for that.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:22.160
Indexes, we've got the index file right there on the root directory, but we also end up with index files inside of pack folders.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.720
And so, you know, it gets a little bit interesting.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:33.200
The first one to dive into is probably the objects folder, because this is the stash of all of the content in your repository.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:41.760
Now, as you commit something into Git, you'll first add it to the staging area, and then you'll commit it with a message.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:46.860
And as you do so, you'll end up with content inside the objects folder.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:53.200
Now, what's interesting to note here is if you look at a Git log, you'll see hexadecimal thing.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.080
You know, it might be seven characters, or it might be much longer than that.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.460
And as you do that log, you can take a look at that.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:06.080
Inside the objects folder are folders with two digits.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.640
Those are the first two digits of the commit number.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:15.780
Inside that folder is all of the commits that happen to start with that two-digit number or letter.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:20.440
So, you know, that means that not all of the files will be in one directory.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.680
They'll kind of be arranged a little bit.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.240
That gets around too many files in one directory.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:31.100
But it's that objects folder that then stores all of the content there.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:37.120
Now, what's interesting is I think of it, if I commit one, and that's where this talk was really cool.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.900
When I commit one thing and I go look in that objects folder, I will have three different files.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.640
Now, they are zlib compressed.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.220
Yeah, you can't just open them up and look at them, right?

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.100
They're kind of scrambled up.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.000
But it's not magic.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.640
I built a tool that will unzlib compress one, which is pretty cool.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.580
But once we identify a thing that we want to do, we can also use git catfile.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:10.440
Git catfile allows us to look at both the type and the content in a particular node.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:19.160
This is a directional, acyclical graph nodes, DAG nodes, that specify relationships between these things.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.200
But what's cool is we...

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:21.220
Here's a branch.

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.260
Here's a file that's in that branch, something like that.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.060
They're not branches, but they are folders.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.180
Here's a file within a folder.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.520
Here's the content.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:32.360
So we have three different types of these nodes.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.400
One is a commit.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:41.000
And in the commit, we have the author's name and the date that it was committed, the message that we gave.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.640
And also in that commit is a reference to the tree nodes that are part of that commit.

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.500
Now, each tree node can specify files or folders.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.800
So a tree node can reference another tree node.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.220
And inside the tree node, we have references to those files.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.100
So I might have a tree node that references file1.txt.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.480
The third type is a blob.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.940
And so as we look at blobs, then that's the actual content in the thing.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.580
So go back to the...

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.600
Click on...

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.160
Oh, I don't think I have a one to get back to the blob.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:24.800
But the cool part about this app, hit refresh, and you'll get to that big blob of stuff.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.180
Here's all of the commits in this repository.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.800
So we had something visually to look at here, and it's about to pull up its rendering.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.340
Yeah, it's not super performant.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.100
That's all right.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:41.360
You built this thing called Git-Explorer, which is a little web app that runs that you pointed at a Git repository.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:47.300
And it lets you look at these things that you're describing visually and then click around on them, right?

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:47.780
Right.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.040
So click on Show Type, and we see the three different colors emerge.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.060
There are commits, trees, and blobs.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:36:03.880
And it's like, okay, I have a whole bunch of files in my objects folder, and I can click on each one, and I'll use that Git cat file thing to go figure out what it is.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.980
But it's like, you know, I really wish I had more stuff about it.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:14.020
So that's where I click alphabetical, and that will put them all in order.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:18.760
Click on Tags, and now you can see the name of that thing.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.580
And I'm only showing the first seven digits of the commit here.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:27.780
But now you can kind of get a sense for, here are all the objects, and click on each one and open it up.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:36.840
Right, and these names are what often go by shahs in Git parlance, which is just the type of hash, S-H-A, whatever it is.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:44.760
And I don't know how many people know this, but you can use sub pieces of the shah to refer to it in Git.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:50.060
So you don't have to say the full, I don't know, what is that, 32 characters or whatever to describe a name.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:56.120
As long as it's enough to be unique, it'll go, like, you can issue commands against these things in this abbreviated form, right?

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.260
Right, exactly.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.420
So oftentimes, only two digits is necessary, sometimes three or four.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.920
And that's why often when you're looking at Git history, it'll only show you the first seven.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.980
Surely enough, yeah.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:12.860
Now what we start to do as we're clicking through this is we get a feel for all of these green nodes.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.940
That's the content in the files.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.180
The blue nodes are the tree nodes.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:22.360
And as I click on one of those blue tree nodes, then it references other files.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.700
I can see their shahs, their Git hashes there in that list.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.980
And then as I look at the red ones, the commits, that's my commit message.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:35.720
That includes the parent node that was the commit right before this.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.240
It also references the tree node that has the files for this.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.160
And so wouldn't it be nice if we could, I don't know, arrange them in a way?

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:50.540
So let's, instead of going from alphabetical, let's click on parent-child and start to see the relationships.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:54.300
We'll need to turn on lines now, and we probably want to also turn on tags.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:59.840
And now we can take a look at those commits and see how each one references.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:05.640
Now, if you have a very large repository, then I haven't built scrolling yet.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:05.920
Sorry.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:13.320
But you can see that the red commit nodes all reference each other and reference the previous

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:13.680
ones.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.340
And then they go into these tree nodes that may reference other tree nodes.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.400
And eventually those reference the file nodes.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:25.780
That's part of my demo highlight that if we create the same file content and commit it in

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:30.540
two different directories, it's actually only one blob on disk.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.460
There's only one green blob node.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:38.460
But the cool part here is we were able to explore each of these objects in our repository and we

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.720
get a feel for how they work.

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.000
So if I change one line in a very big file, what gets committed?

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.200
Well, the entire file.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.380
Yeah.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:52.960
And I'd suspect that's probably why large binary files are not ideal to be committed here, even

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.460
though you technically can put them there.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:54.880
Right.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.900
So that's the first group of things is these objects.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.120
So that's the top level objects folder in the .git folder.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:01.540
Yeah.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.540
Yes, exactly.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.600
Now, there is a pack folder inside there.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:13.880
If you run various commands, then Git will say, well, do I have too many commits, too many

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:20.020
of these objects that I need to pack together to make this repository smaller on disk?

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:27.260
And if so, then it'll automatically do a GC, a garbage collect, where it starts to pack those

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.280
into pack files.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.620
Now, it's kind of a Zlib compressed group of Zlib compressed files.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.360
So it gets very meta there.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.160
But that's what the pack folder is inside the objects folder.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:37.460
Yeah.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.260
Okay.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.520
So next up, let's talk about the refs folder.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:47.000
Now, when we look at refs, we look at branches and tags and remotes.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.100
These are files that reference commits.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:56.400
So one example is the head folder in the root of the .git directory.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.920
And inside that head folder, it will specify what head points to.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:06.660
So if you do a Git log and you see that head has an arrow pointing to, I don't know, main

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:15.820
or trunk or develop or whatever, then if you open up that head file, you'll see the text

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.860
in that file is that file.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.260
It's basically the SHA, right?

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:19.880
Is that what it is?

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.820
It is the SHA if your head is pointing at a SHA.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.720
But typically, your head won't be pointing at a SHA.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.160
It'll be pointing at a branch.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:27.780
Oh, yeah.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.220
Refs.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:33.920
Mine right now is refs slash heads slash main, which is the default branch for this project.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.740
So that's awesome.

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.780
Main being the branch.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.040
Yeah.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.580
Head says it goes to refs, heads, main.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.060
So we can go into the refs folder.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.000
We can go into the heads folder.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.740
And we can open up main.

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:49.420
And what's in main is the SHA of the commit that main points to.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:49.760
Okay.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:56.820
What's cool here is that each of these refs, both head and all of these branches, is just

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.740
pointers to the commits in the objects folder.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:00.980
Yeah.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:06.900
So these are like the main file is just a text file that just literally has only the SHA that

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.880
is where that branch currently is.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:09.420
Exactly.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:09.980
Okay.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:16.920
So technically, to create a branch, I just create a file that happens to be in refs, heads.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.940
I name it something and I give it a SHA.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.100
And now I have a branch that points at that thing.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:28.820
Branches in Git are not these durable, fragile things like in TFS or in Subversion.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.720
Branches in Git are just name tags.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.420
They're pointers.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:37.260
They're references to the commits in this tree of objects.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.600
So the cool thing is we can move them around.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:39.760
Right.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.340
They're basically a path of these named commits through the history of the overall history

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:44.780
of it, right?

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.180
Right.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.580
They're the labels that we give it so that we can understand it because communicating in

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.920
32-digit SHAs is not as much fun.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.120
No, definitely not.

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.080
Definitely not.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:00.560
One of the talks that I like to do is I do a Git log and I show that 32-digit hash and I

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.640
read it out.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.120
And then I walk up to somebody in the audience and pretend they're the project manager.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.100
And I go, can I ship it?

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:11.520
And they're like, yeah.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.700
Thus, we have these labels.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.920
Yeah, that's right.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.660
In the heads folder is all of the branches.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.640
In the tags folder is all of the tags.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.220
And there are also just files pointing at commits.

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.740
Sorry, my repo is empty.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:28.320
I don't have any.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.460
But if you, you know, people might tag a release or a version or a beta version or something like

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:32.700
that.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:38.340
So you can refer to it by name, by label instead of, you know, main with the SHA or

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.200
something weird like that.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:39.400
Right.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:39.760
Right.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:48.000
And then we would have a remotes folder, which references where I last saw another copy of

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.060
this Git repository's branches.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:50.460
Yep.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:55.340
So in this case, you have one that says refs, remotes, origin, main, and that's perfect.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:43:02.340
That's where I last saw this server, this server's main branch.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:07.240
Now, in this case, I chose to call my main, my remote server origin.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:12.820
Now, this could be a server that we've designated as the server.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.220
It could be one of my coworkers.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.360
It could be a network share.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:23.080
You know, Git isn't really opinionated about what constitutes a remote repository other than

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.200
that it is in this one.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:24.440
Yeah.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.220
Okay.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.680
How does it know what origin is?

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.460
As I create a remote, I'm going to name it.

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:30.740
Okay.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:36.180
So as I clone, I'm going to say, Git clone this repository and it'll build one and it'll

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.660
by default call it origin.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:43.100
But I could also say, Git remote add origin.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.780
I just gave it a name and then give it a URL.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.040
I could say, Git remote add upstream.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.060
I could say, Git remote add Michael.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.180
Now it's a reference from my repository to yours.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:59.760
And so it's just in this case, in the refs, remotes folder, it's just a folder

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.520
referencing the branches that I saw on your machine.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:02.780
Nice.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.780
Is there somewhere where it stores like the URL?

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.620
It does.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.400
And that is the next section that we may want to look at, which is configuration.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:14.560
Let's open up the config file in the root of the .git folder.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.040
All right.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.380
Now this configuration file is really cool.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:22.060
It includes all kinds of configuration details associated with our repository.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:28.120
Now in this case, we have remote origin where we've named this one and here's the URLs that

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:28.860
we go to there.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.960
In this case, it's github.com slash talk Python.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:36.360
We have other configuration details associated with this repository.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:44.460
This .git config file is actually one of three on my machine.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:51.540
And we'll start out with our config file that's installed when we install Git.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:59.120
So it's probably in program files or it's in user local bin or somewhere off in the ether

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.300
of how we install it.

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:01.740
We probably don't want to touch that one.

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:07.020
But that's the base configuration of all the options that we chose when we installed Git.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:14.100
So if I run a command, if I were to say something like git email global, something like that,

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.920
you know, the .g command, maybe it's modifying that one.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.280
Well, the one that we just talked about was the system one.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.640
The second one is the global one, which is user specific.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.800
I find that name a little confusing.

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:30.240
But my user specific, the .git config in my user home directory.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:38.160
So, you know, see users rob or user or the tilde slash directory Mac and Linux.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:44.520
That .git config overrides any settings in my system configuration.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:52.640
And so oftentimes when you first install Git, you'll say git config dash global user.email user.name.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:58.600
And so if you open up that .git config in your user home directory, you'll see those settings.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:06.560
You'll see your username, your name, your email, and all of the details that you've configured there.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:13.160
And then the third one is the config file here in your repository that will override any of those settings.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:21.700
So it doesn't make sense for us to have origin in our system, in our user specific configuration file,

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:25.100
because, well, each repository will have a different origin.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:31.760
But it probably does make sense to put our name and email in our system, in our user specific directory,

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.900
because that would apply to all the repositories on our machine.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.520
Yeah, absolutely.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.500
Almost all of them.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:43.560
You might be doing home-based open source work, and you might be doing corporate button-up work,

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:49.560
and your formal corporate place might not love your corporate email on the open source project.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:50.360
Exactly.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.060
Or maybe you don't have it.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:51.100
Exactly.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:51.860
Yeah.

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:56.320
So when I have that scenario where I need to set my email address,

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.460
maybe my name differently in different repositories,

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:04.220
I can set it in my .git config in my user home directory,

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:07.200
and then I can override it in each repository.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.300
Just copy those couple of lines, set them in your config file here,

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:16.680
and now you've set this repository to track your email differently.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:21.580
Is there a git command to change it so I don't actually go into the .git folder,

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:24.840
and I say, like, git email but not global, or git config email?

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.020
Yeah.

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.540
Leave off the --global.

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:26.840
Yeah.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:27.360
Okay.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:27.960
Perfect.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.140
Then you don't even have to know how.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.820
You just know I do git email and what my email is.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:33.200
Right.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.700
Now, there are other configuration files here in the .git folder,

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:41.740
but the config file is really the big one that we like to talk about.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:41.980
Yeah.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:42.680
Okay.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.580
But you'll see a description file here.

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.220
That's a configuration file.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:51.940
Git InstaWeb is a web server baked into Git

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.180
that allows you to kind of browse through your repository.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:48:00.680
Now, Git InstaWeb works pretty well on Linux and not so great on Windows.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.200
I bet you've never used InstaWeb in most scenarios.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.960
I'd never heard of it until you brought it up the other day.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:11.120
Yeah, but this configuration file is the name of the website

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.140
when you launch Git InstaWeb.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:17.360
Yeah, so Git ships with a web server that can be the host of that Git repository.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:17.820
Yeah.

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.480
Now, why would I ever do that?

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.600
Why wouldn't I just use GitHub?

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.460
Exactly, which is why you've never heard of Git InstaWeb.

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:24.780
Yeah.

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.120
I mean, you might say we want a private Git server or a public Git server

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.700
or something like that.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.240
That might be.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.740
But yeah, usually, yeah, I've never heard of it.

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:33.400
So very interesting.

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.820
All right.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.300
What else is in this list here?

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:36.880
Yeah.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.140
Yeah.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.460
So we've talked about the content in the objects folder.

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:43.900
We've talked about the branches and tags in the rest folder.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.440
We've talked about configuration.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.340
Let's go poke in the hooks folder.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:47.760
Yeah.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.520
Hooks is interesting.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.180
Yeah.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:50.540
It is really cool.

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:53.100
The hooks folder is where we do automation.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:53.540
Yeah.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:57.000
So people probably heard of pre-commit hooks, right?

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.240
Like probably the most popular example in the Python space is to run the black formatter.

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.300
So it automatically formats your code before it checks it in.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:11.920
So indentation, white space, like between a comma and an argument or something.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.040
It's always consistent.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:17.700
So you don't get these like back and forth editor driven, you know, merge issues.

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:18.900
There's no real change.

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.620
But I format it in my editor.

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:21.960
You format it in yours.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:25.940
And back and forth, it goes between spaces with a comma and no spaces with a comma,

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:26.760
spaces with a comma.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:32.000
And so you could set up a pre-commit hook to canonicalize it before it goes in.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.620
But there's more than pre-commit, right?

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:33.820
Yeah.

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:38.820
I could set up a pre-commit hook to make sure all my unit tests pass before I commit.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.320
I could set up.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:47.700
And so what we see here in this hooks directory is all different kinds of automation things.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:53.220
So a pre-commit hook, a pre-merge hook, a pre-push hook, a pre-rebase hook.

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:56.200
And each of these are shell scripts.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.220
Well, with one exception, it's a Perl script.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:02.060
But you see at the very top, it says slash bin slash sh.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.500
Well, I'm on a Windows box.

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.200
Is this shell script still going to work?

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.620
Well, yeah.

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:14.260
Get ships with enough Linux-y, Unix-y, Bash-like stuff to be able to kick off these shell scripts

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:17.120
and run them as it would on any Linux system.

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:17.480
Okay.

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:17.920
Interesting.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.040
So there's basically like a little mini Bash that comes with it.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.400
I remember people using that Bash shell from Git.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.580
It'd be more Unix-like on Windows.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:26.300
Exactly.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:29.900
So here in this shell script, I could do all kinds of things.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.520
Maybe I'm calling a PowerShell script.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.480
Maybe I'm calling a Python script.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.180
Maybe I'm calling a Node formatter.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.820
I can just call into whatever tasks I want to accomplish.

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:43.840
And that will then accomplish that task whenever this event happens.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:50.300
So what I love to do in my demo is remove all the dot sample pieces so that they're actual scripts.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:55.640
And then just merely the presence of that file will be able to kick off that automation.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.060
All right.

00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:03.260
So there's a bunch of files that are sample shell scripts named things like pre-commit.sample or pre-merge commit sample.

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:08.380
If I just called it pre-commit but not the dot sample, now it's going to be active?

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:08.860
Exactly.

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:09.280
Okay.

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.120
Nice.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.620
Now the cool part about these is that I have all my automation set up.

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.660
I'm running the formatters.

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:18.020
I've got my unit test passing and it's great.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.520
But this file is inside my dot git folder.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.280
So I can't commit these.

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:27.700
It's not one of the files that is available for me to add to the staging area.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:27.920
Right.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.840
It would be Inception if you tried to commit stuff in the dot git folder.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.340
Right.

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:44.840
So often we'll create shell scripts outside the dot git folder and commit them and then have something here inside the dot git folder that calls into that other shell script.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.000
Yeah.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.260
And you mentioned some kind of node-based tool that you can use, right, that will manage that stuff, right?

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:50.620
Right.

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:51.700
There's lots of packages.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:56.200
The one that I show is git hooks that is an npm package.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:08.200
And once you install git hooks, it will actually create all those aliases from the folder where you actually build the scripts that you can commit into this hooks directory so that then they'll run.

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.700
Just installing this package installs those hooks into place.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:11.960
I see.

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:23.880
So basically, if you just install the package once, it will find those other external scripts and make those be the ones that git sees with the advantage that you can commit them into GitHub.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.880
And if somebody makes a change, that change will propagate to everyone else.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.260
Yes.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:31.340
You can commit them into git, push them up to GitHub, and they will run.

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:31.640
Okay.

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.040
Yeah.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:32.440
Fantastic.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:32.820
Yeah.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:33.160
Yeah.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:33.580
Very neat.

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:33.900
Very neat.

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:34.140
Okay.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:35.540
What else have we got here?

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.920
What else have we got?

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.220
I think maybe index, maybe?

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.100
That's an interesting one.

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:39.540
Yeah.

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.140
Index is really interesting.

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:48.120
As we look through index, if we just pop it open in an editor, it's just a bunch of gobbledygook.

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.680
And we're like, what is this?

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.600
It's a file, right?

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:50.860
Yeah.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:51.340
Yeah.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:58.660
This isn't the only index, but this is one of the really cool indexes where git keeps track of interesting stuff.

00:52:58.660 --> 00:52:59.080
That's nice.

00:52:59.080 --> 00:52:59.380
Yeah.

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.720
Check out this blown up.

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:06.040
If I try to look at it, it's like a binary blob exploded and died on my terminal.

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.040
But there are file names in there somewhere, so it must be something to do with that.

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:09.500
Yeah.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:14.020
I think it's git ls-files, where you can go look through this index.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:19.440
And if we pass in flags to that, then it'll be able to show the status of those files.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.460
But this is looking through that index.

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:29.020
And the cool part about looking through that index is that git, if it wants to do a quick thing,

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:36.820
like which files have changed, needs to know the blob that is checked out in my working directory.

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.140
You know, which blob did I start with?

00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:39.560
Right.

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:43.260
As we look through those objects, we saw a big tree of things.

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:48.940
And so opening up each commit node, finding all the tree nodes, opening up each tree node,

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:51.960
finding all the blob nodes, that takes a while.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:58.460
And so this is a cache, an index, of all the files that I checked out in my working directory.

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:08.680
This allows git to move really fast as it looks through my folder and identifies any files that have changed or new files or things like that.

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.800
So that's what this index file is for.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.040
Yeah.

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:17.280
And my git incantations are not pulling it up here, but I think you can get it to show the shah of each file as well, right?

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:17.660
Right.

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:24.720
In which case, then instead of traversing the whole history and actually looking at the file on the hard drive and saying,

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.320
well, what is its hash?

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.320
Do I have an update for this file?

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:30.920
I could just look in this binary file and get that answer, right?

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:31.500
Exactly.

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.020
Nice.

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:32.500
Yeah.

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:36.540
The next section of files that we want to look at are logs.

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:45.020
And the cool thing about git's logs is they keep track of where all of our branches have been.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:52.640
So if we cat.git slash logs slash head, then we get a thing that kind of looks really weird.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.720
We've got really long lines in this.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.980
And in our first line, it says a whole bunch of zeros.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:04.520
And then we've got the git shah of the commit that it went to and a little bit about that commit.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:10.140
This is a log of where our branches have been.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:13.620
And so we'll have a file for each of our branches.

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.020
In this case, we're looking at the head file.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:20.960
So we see that head started out nowhere and ended up at ed13fc.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.620
And then it has my username, my email, and then some other stuff.

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:24.980
Yeah.

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:32.140
The really interesting thing is this log can be really useful if, for example, I switch branches

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:33.140
and forgot where I was.

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:37.240
Or I commit something and then I uncommit it.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.060
That's a thing.

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.740
And I want to get back to it.

00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:42.260
Or I delete a branch before I merged it in.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.060
Or, you know, those types of things.

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:51.580
If I do that quickly enough, you know, remember git's going to do that garbage collect and go prune nodes that aren't used anymore.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:56:00.100
If I get there quickly enough, I can use this log to go back through my refs and go find that commit.

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:02.040
The objects are still there.

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.760
I just don't have any refs pointing to them anymore.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:08.860
And so the command that we can use on the command line is called git ref log.

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:12.800
And we can pass git ref log a particular branch we want to look at.

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:19.660
But by default, if we just say git ref log, all one word, then it will show the history of head.

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.180
Now, in this case, we didn't move it very far.

00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:26.900
But we can see there, oh, and here's the branch that I just deleted.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.540
And here's the SHA for this one.

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:38.480
And so at that point, then we can git checkout that commit and get back to the content that we had created and then lost the reference to.

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.600
Right. Okay. Nice.

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.460
There's a little bit of recovery, kind of an undelete if you had to in there.

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:44.000
Yeah.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:44.640
Nice.

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:47.600
The funny thing about this, the command is git ref log.

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.960
But I've also heard it pronounced git ref log.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.480
And I'm like, so I've got this cat of nine tails.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.500
And I'm like, no, you can't.

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.020
Git ref log.

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:56.500
Exactly.

00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:57.420
Do it again.

00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:03.440
But once you understand how the refs folder works, then git ref log makes a whole lot of sense.

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:08.620
We're looking at what those ref files have said in the past.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.860
Here's what it was before we changed it.

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.960
Here's what it became after we changed it.

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.740
And a little bit more context around it.

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:17.040
Where you're currently working is where the head is pointing.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.860
Often that's some point in a branch.

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:24.200
And this is like, where's the history of that bin throughout the branch that it's on?

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:24.900
Yes.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.240
Yeah.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:25.700
Very cool.

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:26.240
Very cool.

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.960
So we're getting sort of short on time here.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.380
What else should we be talking about?

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:37.580
What else should we close this out with in terms of content of our .git file?

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.260
The only other section in here is temp files.

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:47.560
So if we've committed stuff, we might see a commit underscore MSG file.

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.540
Or maybe it's called commit underscore message.

00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:52.740
We might see other temp files.

00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:56.280
We have a temp folder sometimes baked into things.

00:57:56.780 --> 00:58:01.620
And so that's the last group of files here in the .git folder is temp files.

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:06.100
Temp files, configuration, objects, refs, hooks.

00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:10.840
These are all the pieces that come together to make this git database.

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.140
And once again, you really can't break git.

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:16.640
You know, it's like, well, I did this incantation and it's broken.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.440
Well, no.

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.660
You can use ref log to get back to a particular commit.

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:25.520
Or you can use various commands, checkout to get back to where you need to.

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:30.240
Maybe you'll use reset to, you know, kind of get your working directory back in shape.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:37.600
But that structure of git, the double entry bookkeeping inside this repository, is really

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.360
good at keeping track of the things.

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.380
And so you really can't break git.

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:42.600
Yeah.

00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.940
And back this up.

00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:45.800
You back it up, right?

00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:46.520
You back up this folder.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.620
You back up basically everything, right?

00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:49.040
All right.

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:53.640
Now, it might be easier to back it up, not by just backing up this folder, but by publishing

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.460
your changes to another repository.

00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:57.480
And that's where we have great workflows.

00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:01.700
Like, I will push all of these changes to another server.

00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:03.200
Maybe I'll call that server origin.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:03.920
Yeah, absolutely.

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:07.580
And that is automatic if you check out from somewhere like, clone it from somewhere like

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:07.760
GitHub.

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.060
Right.

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:08.360
GitHub.

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:12.220
So there's just a couple other things maybe I want to touch on really quickly while we

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.160
have a moment.

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:19.400
When you talked about breaking git, there's an interesting little design thing called dangit,

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.740
git, or even better.

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:24.980
Maybe I'll link to the better version, the not safe for work version where you're frustrated

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.660
and it's like, oh no, I just did something terribly wrong.

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:28.700
Please tell me how to do it.

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:31.760
And reflog is right at the top of these things.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:36.620
I committed and immediately realized I need to make a change or I need to change my commit

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:37.000
message.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.220
And yeah, anyway, that's a pretty interesting one.

00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:41.660
Another thing we've talked a lot about GitHub.

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:46.020
And what we haven't really talked about is gitignore, right?

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:49.760
As much as you want to track stuff, you don't want to automatically track a bunch of things

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:56.840
that are working files, you know, build stuff from C++ or maybe node underscore modules

00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:03.660
or high charm working files or all sorts of things should not go into your project, right?

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:04.880
Your vn directory.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.300
Yeah.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.520
Yes, exactly.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.180
Your vn directory.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:07.680
Absolutely.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.660
So there's gitignores.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:16.040
Any content that you download, any content that you compile, any of that content shouldn't

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:21.660
be in your repository because it changes too infrequently and it's usually easier to either

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.440
rebuild it or redownload it.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.580
All those things should be ignored.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:25.860
Yeah.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:28.680
It's a huge merge nightmare as well.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.660
Even if you could keep it, right?

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:34.120
Suppose I check in my vn directory and you go on Windows.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:38.220
Well, you can't have the same contents as mine because mine is the macOS version.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:42.260
So you change it, put your Windows version in there and I get it back out and it breaks

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.040
my Mac versions.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:43.540
I got right.

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:44.900
So there's stuff you should ignore.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.420
Absolutely.

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:52.080
And when you create a new project on GitHub, it very handily says, hey, what kind of project

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:52.500
is this?

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.260
We can get you far down the road with your gitignore.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.540
Is this a Python project?

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.860
Is it a node project or whatever, right?

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:02.920
What I wanted to point out is that dropdown list.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:09.140
There's actually a GitHub project called gitignore that has the ignore for all of these different

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:09.500
languages.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:15.980
So if you want to make a change to say Python's gitignore, you can go there and pull it up

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:16.420
and see it.

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:20.640
And you could technically do a PR against it to say there's this new thing that's common

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.620
in the community now.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.820
Please fix it.

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:23.680
That's pretty cool.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.200
And these things aren't perfect.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:30.340
You know, most of them will exclude everything that starts with or ends with or contains

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:30.760
log.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:37.960
But your iLogger or your log handler might get excluded by that as well.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.540
So you may need to adjust this to get it the way you want.

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:41.780
Yeah.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:46.540
But it is nice to know that at least it'll give you a bit of a start and that it's a thing

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:47.780
that you can contribute back to.

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:52.220
It's not just magic inside of GitHub, but it's its own GitHub open source repository.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:52.640
Right.

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:52.980
Yeah.

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:53.960
Quite neat.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.420
Quite neat.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.540
Let's see.

01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.320
What else should we cover really quick?

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.500
I think maybe just one other thing I think that's maybe worth throwing out there that was

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.600
interesting, but it's pretty specific.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.640
But you've mentioned Windows a couple of times.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.260
Maybe two things, actually.

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:12.880
One is on the shell that you saw on my screen just a minute ago, when I was inside of a git

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:18.680
repository, it would actually put what branch it was on and the git state and so on.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.560
And I have that because I have OhMyZShell installed.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:28.020
Which is a really nice shell for Mac and Linux that gives you things like branch awareness

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.340
and number of changes and so on.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.280
I saw your talk.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.480
You had something like that for PowerShell, the new Microsoft terminal.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:36.960
What were you using for that one?

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.360
It's called OhMyPosh.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:44.220
And Scott Hanselman has a really cool video about OhMyPosh where he walks us through how

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.000
to get it installed.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.760
There are various themes into OhMyPosh, but the theme that I really enjoy actually puts the

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.760
cursor on the next line.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.300
One of the things that I frequently do in command prompt is I have all of the path to get to

01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:57.800
this folder.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.660
And so the command that I'm trying to teach ends up getting wrapped to the next line.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:09.500
And so OhMyPosh or OhMyZSH gives you that additional context of how's your git repository

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:09.980
doing?

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:11.700
You could also show your remote.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.140
It's basically just running a shell script behind the scenes.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.480
And so you can modify that shell script.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.860
Scott Hanselman is diabetic and so needs to check his blood sugar a lot.

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:28.040
And so he actually has built into his OhMyPosh script, his blood sugar number, because it's

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:28.940
really easy to miss.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.300
And it's one of those things that's really important not to miss.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.780
So it's in his terminal all the time.

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.220
Probably even color code it, right?

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.380
If it's out of range, make it red.

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.880
If it's not out of range, you make it green, something like that.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.720
Yes.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.340
Wow.

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:42.000
How interesting.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.540
Yeah, this looks fantastic.

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:47.160
I've never played with this before, but yeah, it looks really nice.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.140
You recommend it?

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.420
Yeah, I do.

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:49.940
Cool, cool.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.100
All right.

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:55.080
Well, I guess the one other thing that I was going to throw out there is I heard of this

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.520
thing called VSF for Git.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:04.680
We talked about large files and this sounds like it's very much a Windows only thing, but

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.300
it's a neat idea.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:10.900
This virtual file system for Git that if you have a really large repository, it's kind of

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.980
like the smart sync for Dropbox or something.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.580
It only pulls the files and interacts with the files that you actually touch, but it does

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:20.520
that behind the scenes without you knowing it.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.440
Have you seen this?

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:21.780
Yeah.

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:28.020
And we actually said VSF for Git, but it's actually VFS for Git, virtual file system.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:32.480
It's great when your repository is just massively huge.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:35.820
And 98% of our repositories are not.

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:41.300
But when you have the code base of, I don't know, Windows, then you need something like

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.760
this because you can't Git clone the entire thing.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.340
GitHub, not GitHub.

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.780
Google is famous for having their corporate monorepo.

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:54.020
And I suspect that's bigger than you could Git clone onto each machine as well.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:59.980
And so the cool part is one of the benefits of subversion that we lost as we moved to Git

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:03.440
was I could clone only part of a repository.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.440
And VFS kind of gives us that ability back.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.140
Most of the time we don't need it.

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:14.300
But if you've been really bad and you've committed a whole bunch of binary files to your repository,

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.300
it's interesting.

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:17.680
It might be worth kicking the tires.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.560
It isn't necessarily Windows only.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.740
It is plug-in to Git itself.

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:26.040
But it allows you to put that checkout directory somewhere else.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.980
So, for example, on a shared network drive.

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:35.880
Now I have all of those objects, all of those blobs in one place,

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:38.160
and I don't need to copy each of those to my machine.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:38.460
Yeah.

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:39.580
Interesting.

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:44.760
The Windows people that were switching to Git said it was really a nightmare.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:50.440
So, for example, the source code for Linux repo is something like 600 megs or 0.6 gigs.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.760
Windows is like 270 gigs.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.400
So it's really ginormous.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.520
And they said to do a clone took 12 hours.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.280
To do a checkout took three hours.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.600
To do a Git status took eight minutes.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.460
And to do an add and commit took 30 minutes before they made this change.

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:10.260
So they were suffering some hard pains to go down this path for sure.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.320
I guess it probably is worth it for them.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:12.600
Right.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.060
All right.

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.840
Well, I guess we probably should put a bow on it.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.720
We're more or less out of time there, Rob.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.960
But I'll ask you the two questions I always ask at the end of the show.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.540
If you're going to write some code, what editor do you use?

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.520
It depends on the code that I'm trying to write.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.720
In most cases, I'll reach for VS Code.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.080
But I'll also reach for Visual Studio.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:31.360
Right.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.340
If you're going to be doing ASP.NET stuff, like you said.

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.180
Sometimes I'm also known to reach for...

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:40.320
If you're doing like ASP.NET or something you were talking about like that or something you could...

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.060
Maybe something like WPF where the tools are built in.

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.160
You have to basically...

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:44.560
Not have to.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.420
Almost have to use them.

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:48.640
But sometimes I also reach for Sublime Text or TextEdit.

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.040
Cool.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:49.180
Cool.

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:53.680
And then often ask for a Python package library recommendation.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:57.300
Maybe we could make it your Git script.

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.560
The one that runs the pre-commit stuff.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.640
The one that moves that outside the Git file.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.440
What was that called again?

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.820
It's called Git Hooks.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:04.620
Git Hooks.

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.300
And let me grab a link to it.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.140
It's actually a Node package, but exactly.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:08.540
Yeah.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:09.640
You just install it wherever.

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.040
And it's good to go, right?

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:11.640
Yes.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.660
And so if you have maybe a Flask server and you want to...

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:21.860
As part of your Flask server, maybe you have a React or a Vue app or you need to pull down

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:27.500
jQuery as part of your client-side dependencies, then you may have enough Node stuff to be able

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.180
to leverage this as well.

01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:29.460
Yeah.

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:29.900
Yeah.

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:30.600
That makes a lot of sense.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.100
If you're already using NPM because you're doing front-end stuff, then you might as well,

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:35.320
right?

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:35.880
Yes.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:36.160
Yeah.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:36.460
Very cool.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:39.280
One of the things that we didn't talk about, and it's really cool how this happened,

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.540
Git workflows.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:46.180
What's beautiful about Git is it's really unopinionated about how you do your workflow.

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:47.840
Are you going to do GitFlow?

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.300
Are you going to do GitHub Flow?

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.140
Are you going to do something else?

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:56.980
Git can work for all of those scenarios because it is just a mechanism of committing and sharing

01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:57.420
files.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:02.720
It doesn't impose a specific branching or naming convention.

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:09.120
You can choose to put those on top, but Git's workflow is really open to whatever you need

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:09.500
it to do.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:09.760
Yeah.

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:15.460
Well, when I was first getting familiar with this whole PRs and merging and those kinds

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.340
of things, I felt like, oh, that's a Git thing.

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.160
That's a GitHub thing.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.720
It has nothing to do with Git, right?

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.420
It just Git facilitates that on top of it.

01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:24.260
So you can choose however you want to work, right?

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:24.600
Right.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.020
Quite cool.

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:25.860
All right.

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:31.080
Well, I don't normally close out this show with a joke, but Robinson had a good one here

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:31.940
in the live stream.

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.480
So I'm going to put this up here for us as our parting thought.

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.120
And then I'll ask you for one more as well, maybe.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:36.420
Yeah.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:41.160
So he said, there's a programmer who once told him, couldn't use Git.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.040
He was afraid to commit.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.820
He was afraid of the Git commitment.

01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:49.160
Oh, that's awesome.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:49.820
Yeah.

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:50.100
Yeah.

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:50.240
Yeah.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:50.820
Thank you for that.

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:51.580
Thanks for making us laugh.

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.240
All right.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:52.960
Find a call to action.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.900
People want to go a little bit deeper than Git.

01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:59.900
Maybe they just do the three commands, Git clone, I don't know, Git add, Git commit,

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:00.360
Git push.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.340
Like that's four commands.

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:04.440
Like beyond that, like how do you get more into this world?

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:09.280
What's really interesting is as we're coming off of those other systems, we want to kind

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.120
of build up that tribal knowledge that we had.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:15.680
And so we're going to go grab those three or five commands and we're going to stick them

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.240
to the post-it under our keyboard.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:23.320
Take the next step to go figure out, you know, what is the next command that I want to do?

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.820
Or how does this command work?

01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:31.640
What we did today was we explored through that .git folder so that we could take that next level

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.620
to see how it works.

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:34.420
Git isn't a black box.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.640
It's not magic.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.920
It just works a little bit differently than the source control system you might have been

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.540
familiar with.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.720
So definitely get familiar with it.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:48.260
Google the terms that you're looking for and really start to embrace that mechanism and

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.560
get really powerful with Git.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:55.300
I'm confident that you can get past just those few commands and you can make it just an inherent

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:59.440
process in your workflow and use it to be really, really powerful.

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.460
Specifically, separating the save points from the publish points.

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:06.700
That's the thing you couldn't do before that you can now do with Git.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.400
Yeah, well said.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.380
Definitely agree with all of that.

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:14.360
I think getting really good with source control and source control these days really means Git

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:14.740
almost.

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:18.900
It allows you to be fearless with your code, right?

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.860
So often people are like, oh, I would like to try this, but what if I break it?

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:22.880
What if it doesn't go right?

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:28.180
Well, if you know how to create your branches, work locally, do all sorts of stuff, roll back,

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:31.020
you can just go crazy and just explore things.

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.820
And if it doesn't work, throw it away.

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.840
No harm, no foul.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.500
It's lovely.

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:40.680
And if you get really stuck, hit me up on Twitter at Rob underscore Rich and show me the code where

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.460
you got stuck and let's get you unstuck because I would love to continue this conversation and

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.980
really help you be successful.

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:47.740
All right.

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.880
Well, thank you for taking the time and being here.

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:51.840
It's been great to chat, Git with you.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:52.540
Most definitely.

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.540
Thanks for having me on.

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:53.780
Yeah.

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.420
See you later.

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:58.220
This has been another episode of Talk Python to Me.

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.960
Our guest on this episode was Rob Richardson.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.440
It's been brought to you by our courses over at Talk Python Training.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.220

Thanks so much for listening.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:51.960
I really appreciate it.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.860
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:11:53.860 --> 01:12:14.400
I'll see you next time.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:14.400
Bye.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:14.460
Bye.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:14.480
Bye.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:14.480
Bye.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:14.480
Bye.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:44.460
Thank you.
