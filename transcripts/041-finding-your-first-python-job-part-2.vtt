00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.700
This episode of Talk Python to Me is the second in a two-part series about getting your first Python job

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.600
in an attempt to bring a wide spectrum of thoughts on this discussion.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.680
It's Getting Your First Python Job as a Python Developer Part 2.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.020
This time, we hear from the experts on episode number 41, recorded December 10th, 2015.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:49.140
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.220
the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.340
This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy.

Be sure to find them on Twitter and tell them thanks.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.700
Welcome, everybody.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.240
This is part two in our Getting Your First Job as a Python Developer.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.440
I hope you've listened to episode 39, where we introduce the topic and we talk to new developers

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.860
who just got their first job in Python.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.060
Now we're turning the tables and we're going to talk to the experts,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.320
the people that do the evaluating and hiring and finally make the decision on who get these jobs.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.060
We have experts from a bunch of great companies, including Netflix and PayPal.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.280
The format will be the same as part one.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.700
We have a bunch of guests who are experts and we're going to ask them questions and we'll kind of do a panel type discussion.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.620
We'll hear from each of them in turn.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.520
So let me introduce the panelists.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:16.620
Last time I made a couple of book recommendations.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.240
I'll just repeat them here really briefly because I think the way that people should look at their career and jobs is undergoing a pretty dramatic shift.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.220
And on one hand, we all have to individually take responsibility for promoting ourselves and building our skills.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.840
And the other, the landscape of employment is changing somewhat.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.180
So if you want to explore these ideas, be sure to check out Soft Skills by John Sonmez and The End of Jobs by Taylor Pearson.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.320
Okay, with that, let's get on to the questions.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.660
So you can hear a lot of advice from our experts.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.760
And I want to make sure that you know where they're coming from, the type of people that they expect to be working with when they give this advice.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.740
So my first question to the group was, what kind of Python developers do you work with and do you interview?

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.180
Our first two panelists should sound familiar to you.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.520
First up, we're going to hear from Roy Rappaport from Netflix.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.480
He was the guest on show 16 when we talked about how Netflix is using Python to do amazing things.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.740
And following Roy, we have Mahmoud Hashemi from PayPal.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.640
He was on show 4 talking about Enterprise Python.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.100
So let's hear from these guys.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.100
Roy's up first.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.120
What kind of developers do I get to hire and interview?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.540
Typically, I work with and interview two kinds of Python people.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.580
Devopsy people focusing on orchestration and operations in an AWS environment of a large ecosystem.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.380
And people who can use Python to build solutions to some of the problems that arise in operating in these sort of large ecosystems.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:10.740
So that's both ad hoc Python use to solve the sort of 5 to 10 minute sort of problem and architecting a Python based system to, for example, auto discover SSL certificates in a large distributed environment like Netflix's, for example, and alert us when some would expire.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.980
Which was actually the first project that I got to be responsible for when I became part of the engineering organization here at Netflix.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.560
Hi, my name is Mahmoud Hashemi.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.640
I'm lead developer of Python infrastructure at PayPal.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.060
And I'm also the presenter of Enterprise Software with Python coming soon from O'Reilly.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.160
My code is at github.com forward slash M-A-H-M-O-U-D.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.160
Dedicated listeners may recognize my voice from episode number four of Talk Python to Me.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.180
And it's great to be back on the show.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.940
Question number one.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.100
What kind of Python devs do I work with and interview?

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.980
So I work with Python infrastructure engineers.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:04.340
Now, software infrastructure is the foundation of all sorts of other software development, from web to backend to batch to automation and tools.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.760
To do it well, you have to have personal experience developing in two or more of those categories.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.540
For the past year or so, my team has been adjunct to the PayPal application security team.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.920
And that's actually who I'm hiring for right now.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.720
So a little plug.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:30.940
If you have at least five years of industry experience and want to get into some ultra high performance Python security work, shoot me an email at M-A-H-M-O-U-D at PayPal.com.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:44.400
All that said, one of my services on the Python infrastructure team is also performing phone and in-person interviews for PayPal teams looking to expand their Python talent through hiring.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.960
So I hire for a lot of teams, in other words.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.460
So just check out the PayPal careers page.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.340
And if you see Python mentioned in the job description, then there's a good chance I'll be doing one of the interviews.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.820
Okay.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.560
Hi, Michael.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.380
So quick intro to me and why I'm going to be answering the questions I'm answering.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.840
Hi, my name is Lorena Messa.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.320
I am a junior on the platform team at Sprouch Social here in Chicago.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:21.480
I'm going to be addressing the questions that are geared towards the quote unquote expert or rather the person who's participating in doing interviews for candidates on our team.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.540
So as a junior, I was I've recently been added into the shuffle for interviewing at Sprout.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:36.980
And I think one of the things that's kind of interesting is that we'll come to talk about is what does it mean to use Python at Sprout and really who are the types of candidates we have come in.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:48.180
I myself came into programming being a first I first started programming in grad school using R to data on structure my data and do what I needed to for my grad research.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.780
And I then went on to explore it more on my own, did an immersion program.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.880
And now I'm with my first software engineering position.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.880
So the way we use Python at Sprout Social, we use Python in a few ways.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.260
The biggest the biggest way we use Python is we use it for our API.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.060
We have a Django API that really glues all the data together.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:23.140
And we take all the data that that's been stored, that's been shaped into the formats that it needs to be from our Java services and is then repurposed into whatever format we need and return it to our web client.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:28.560
So the predominant use for Python is going to be more in tune with web development.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:36.140
We do have some backend services that are written in Python, but the bulk of that of our backend services are going to be Java.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.860
So any heavy data lifting is going to be predominantly there.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:46.240
That being said, we do have a lot of internal tooling that is written in Python.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.280
So, you know, we obviously use Python to glue together some processes that need to be automated.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.280
So be it tools that help developers make their lives easier.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:07.620
If you're just exploring some data, you know, I think people opt to use Python as their first language just for scripting and getting things done or getting their toes wet, writing an initial prototype for something.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.340
And then also we do have Python.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:15.300
We do use Fab, which is for Python to do some operations work.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:23.060
So the type of people that we, that I work with include web development, backend, backend service folks.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.160
And then we do have an in-house data scientist.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.900
Next up is Adelzan Kastamav.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.320
Hello, Mike.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:39.200
Thank you very much for your wonderful podcast and for letting me be a part of your cool project.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.100
So the first question is, what kind of Python devs do you work with and interview?

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.100
So currently we are the biggest online travel agency in Kazakhstan.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.380
And our system is completely risen in Python.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:58.900
Consequently, it means that we are looking for web developers in Python.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:06.780
But also because of the amount of data generated from our users is enormous, is huge.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:14.000
We also should hire people who can work with this data, organize and make sense from these datasets.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.800
Fortunately, Python is also the first class citizen in this area as well.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:30.120
So we are looking for web developers and we are looking for people with a knowledge of statistics and with a working knowledge of Python.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.200
How to connect statistics in Python and make something cool.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.600
Now let's hear from Greg Langston from Connectria Hosting in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.980
At Connectria, we've engaged with many different types of developers.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:50.380
We've engaged with small mom-and-pop style shops and also Fortune 500 companies.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.280
Our customers often have development teams already built into their existing processes.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:04.560
So with most of the UI built on their side, most of our work has been in developing back-end services, API integrations, and workflow automation.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:12.080
That's because our customers typically are partnering with us to increase efficiencies in their existing deployment pipelines,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:19.100
to introduce some new efficiencies in their DevOps continuous integration or deployment models.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:28.100
That being said, we also have several projects mostly written in Flask or Pyramid that integrate with our inventory and monitoring systems.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.480
With some UI components built into microservice architecture using Docker.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:42.780
We often look for candidates who may have experience with infrastructure as code, cloud platform modules such as AWS.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:51.760
This requires experience with Bodo, the AWS client package for Python, or some other cloud platform SDKs.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:11:03.480
We often take a cloud infrastructure orchestration approach to our development, which involves understanding infrastructure components such as load balancers and databases.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:13.620
So for us, having the ability to build and develop those backend services and APIs towards that orchestrational goal is absolutely critical.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.680
And finally, let's hear from Sean Milochik.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:24.900
For about six years, I hired web application developers for a startup that provides payment solutions for clinical trials.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:32.100
We use a lot of Python and Django, use a lot of third-party APIs, and our work was directly customer-facing.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:40.360
The second question I asked everybody was, what is the most important piece of experience that you look for in a candidate?

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:49.140
If I had to narrow down the most important piece of experience I'd look for, it'd be real production experience at some reasonable scale.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:55.800
Not so much in terms of size, you know, in terms of number of machines or all of that, but more in terms of mindset and orientation.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:03.940
I want to see a focus on building things well, automating where possible, and having a long-term view of the systems you put in place.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.360
And I look for a time that you've applied productive laziness to solve a problem.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:20.060
So, the most important fundamental skills I look for are closely related to experience, environmental fluidity, and personal learning ability.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.500
Now, what do those mean?

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:27.260
So, as for environmental fluidity, well, specifically, PayPal uses a lot of Linux.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:34.220
So, I look for candidates that can demonstrate familiarity at the console, interacting with the operating system.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.500
While I don't usually give candidates complex, algorithmic questions on the spot during interviews,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:46.200
I do log them into PayPal's test servers and have them do a little bit of basic debugging.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.780
For the experienced people, you can almost feel them relaxing into a familiar environment.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:57.340
For the inexperienced, the terminal can be an aptly named dark and scary place.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.500
Either way, the command line is a foundational technology critical to enterprise work,

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.320
and I really feel like it's not going away anytime soon.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:13.400
So, lack of command line comfort is a big yellow flag, especially when Linux is so widespread and easy to experiment with on your own.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.240
The other characteristic I look for is learning ability.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:23.400
The skills to read and research naturally, absorbing and arranging information automatically,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.520
because I've been burned once or twice by talented people who were honestly just too lazy to read the docs,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.780
or too intimidated to read the source code.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.180
You don't have to do it in big gulps, but you do need to do it consistently.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.740
So, I usually look at what candidates have done to learn lately,

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.060
like the sources they've been consulting and so forth.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.860
So, for instance, I'll say, show me some source code you've written and what you learned during that process.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:54.100
Or, tell me about a project that sounds much simpler than it actually was.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.840
You know, I might ask, what sites taught you the web?

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.620
Or, have you seen any noteworthy source code lately?

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.960
Have you read any good books?

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.060
On the other hand, I watch out for Hacker News-y types.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:12.320
My projects have topped HN several times in the last couple years, and some lurking is fine,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:19.340
but I want someone ready to outgrow that consumption and commodification of the creative work that is software

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.320
that gets interleaved with the press releases on Hacker News.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:29.580
Someone who's ready to dedicate time to actually create the sorts of things that others will upvote.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:38.540
I think the most important piece of experience is how they approach problems and break it down

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.380
and turn something that may have seemed otherwise impossible or very difficult,

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.160
how they broke that down to smaller, more manageable pieces.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:53.700
After all, coding is about problem solving, and we are building recipes to automate tasks,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.980
to automate things, to make an ecosystem that can work in harmony.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:03.980
So when a candidate comes in and they talk about problems that they've solved and how they went about doing it,

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.760
really I'm trying to see what was the original problem,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.600
what were the ways they went about trying to solve the problem, what worked and what didn't,

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.680
and also, you know, where's the passion?

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.640
What really drives them?

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.260
I think it's really important to have people who are excited about what they do

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:25.700
and are okay to, they're okay with things failing because at the end of the day,

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.820
you're going to try things and it might not work,

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:33.360
but you need to have the ability to then sit down, reflect, understand what went wrong,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.060
and move forward to iterate and try something else.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.300
Demonstrate problem solving, I definitely think is the most important piece of experience.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.780
I think there are two pieces, important pieces.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:50.360
The first one is responsibility and the second one is maturity.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.540
Why?

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.140
From my point of view and from my experience,

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.620
usually people who actually have never worked before,

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.980
for example, students,

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.220
they don't lack technical skills,

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.080
they lack social skills.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.660
And social skills are crucial.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.220
They lack of communicability.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.900
They lack of responsibility, maturity.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:21.260
Because majority of people think that programmers and programming in particular isn't antisocial.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:27.020
And programmers are people who actually are staring at the screens all day long

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:32.620
and writing some magical code and doing something magical.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.480
But I think that programming is a social skill as well.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.660
Because in order to create something,

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.740
in order to create something valuable,

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.840
you have to communicate with many people.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.900
You have to communicate with managers.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.000
You have to communicate with your team members.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.620
You should be a good team player.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.380
You should communicate with customers.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:01.400
Also, you should communicate with the end users of your products

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.100
in order to get feedback.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.420
You should be responsible for everything.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.180
You should write effectively.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:12.160
You should express your thoughts concisely in a written form.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.320
I think writing is also a very crucial skill for programmers.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.660
I mean, not writing code, but writing articles,

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.280
express your thoughts and stuff like that.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.220
And if a person is responsible and mature,

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.860
it is a great pleasure to work with him.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:37.040
We particularly look for experiences where a developer has taken a task

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.440
and researched community packages that can be imported

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:46.180
in order to complete the objective faster than if they were to write vanilla code

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.660
in place of that.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:54.820
The reality of today's code economy with open source technologies is that codes and packages

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.200
likely have already been written to assist in completing particular tasks.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.980
And that means mostly the challenge becomes then kind of assembling those components together

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.960
with some of your own custom development to solve the particular problem.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:15.280
I don't often encourage writing code without consulting existing packages.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:23.240
We use packages such as requests and Flask, for instance, quite heavily.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.880
It's just less necessary than when Python was first developed.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:35.220
We also require that developers know how to set up a virtual environment, virtually in V, for instance,

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.880
in order to create isolation of their package needs,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.620
which can then further be built onto continuous deployment practices.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:50.960
From a code centric perspective, we look for things such as good practices around exception handling,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:56.280
logging, security best practices in your code, those types of things.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:02.200
Any code written must follow good standards around those types of things.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:08.300
Unexpected data formats, bad JSON structures, all those types of things.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.820
So those are critical to what we review.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:21.660
The most important experience I always look for in a candidate is not knowledge with a particular piece of technology,

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:28.040
but curiosity and demonstrating that they are actually interested in programming.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.080
Anything they have not done for school or work.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.480
Someone that even if they didn't get a job as a programmer,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.900
they would have to write code because they're compelled to do it.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.100
It's just part of who they are.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:53.940
This episode is brought to you by Hired.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:20:00.400
Hired is a two-sided, curated marketplace that connects the world's knowledge workers to the best opportunities.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.760
Each offer you receive has salary and equity presented right up front,

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:09.580
and you can view the offers to accept or reject them before you even talk to the company.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.980
Typically, candidates receive five or more offers in just the first week,

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.920
and there are no obligations, ever.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.020
Sounds pretty awesome, doesn't it?

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.080
Well, did I mention there's a signing bonus?

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.180
Everyone who accepts a job from Hired gets a $2,000 signing bonus,

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.500
and as Talk Python listeners, it gets way sweeter.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.800
Use the link Hired.com slash Talk Python to me,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.060
and Hired will double the signing bonus to $4,000.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.800
Opportunity's knocking.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.400
Visit Hired.com slash Talk Python to me and answer the call.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:57.860
The third question I put to our panelists is really trying to dig into what you can bring

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.820
and what you can work on when you don't yet have your first job,

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.780
or at least your first job in Python.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:09.240
So if I'm in school or I'm moving into programming,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.380
but I don't yet have a developer job,

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.540
what can I work on to show that I have some reasonable experience?

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.440
Maybe something like an open source project.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.860
Maybe you could create a little side project or a mobile phone app or a website

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.900
or even participate in some of these code competitions.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:31.100
I'm thinking of things like Kaggle data science competitions and so on.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.640
So let's hear what they have to say.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.520
Roy's up first.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.100
If someone is applying for their first job,

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.860
what can they present to show that they have the right skill set or education?

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.280
Well, first of all, we don't care that much about education necessarily.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.500
We'll talk about that in a moment.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.600
But it's also worth noting that it depends on your definition of what first job is.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.660
Netflix is pretty public about not hiring people straight out of college.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.500
Typically, we don't hire interns.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.840
And so this may be something of a moot point.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.520
But if you're talking about someone's first interaction with us,

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:04.040
we love to see open source contributions and side projects, obviously.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.480
I think looking at mobile phone apps is an interesting example of what you might be passionate about,

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.200
which is interesting.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.560
Even if the actual skills related to that are not particularly relevant to us,

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.260
we tend to think of skills as something you can pick up pretty easily anyway.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.400
I haven't seen much by way of code competitions, so I don't know how relevant they would be.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.400
What we tend to go for really is take-home exercises as part of the recruiting process,

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:34.060
which let people solve some sort of problem we've had run into in the comfort of their own home,

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.620
on their own equipment, using their own time.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.800
That's actually worked really, really well for us.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:50.420
When it comes to first jobs and concrete projects, I'll look at anything and everything.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:57.140
With new developers, it's just so rare to get someone with anything interesting in their GitHub or Bitbucket account.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.140
And so that's definitely my first stop.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.240
Software is increasingly portfolio-driven these days,

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.800
and so I do get a bit discouraged when I see a developer that doesn't have a GitHub or a site or even a blog.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.540
Because you can cram for an interview and you can exaggerate on the resume,

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.440
but you can't really fake a meaningful commit timeline going back a year or two.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.300
Even if it's just some school projects,

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.080
I at least could see that you've tried and you have some basic Git skills.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.480
Contributions to other projects tell a good story too.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.000
You were probably using the project for something, being productive.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.880
You took the time to understand how it worked.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.220
You were able to communicate and lived up to someone else's standards.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.540
That's stressful for a lot of people for sure,

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.340
but that's got a lot in common with enterprise development too.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.700
Side projects and apps that run an environment similar to our own are very interesting.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.320
Mobile phone apps?

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.320
Not as much.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.760
Side note here,

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.460
code competitions and scores from Reddit,

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:54.280
Stack Overflow,

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.400
and Hacker News are okay,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.740
but honestly those skills don't really apply that well internally at a big company.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.200
In my experience, it can be sort of hit or miss.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.420
This may make me kind of unpopular,

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:14.940
but some people who have high scores, high karma on those sites can tend to be a little bit impatient and unhelpful with people inside the company,

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.320
and not to mention the internal processes.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:18.800
That said,

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.820
if you're someone who helps out with mentorship or gets on IRC and answers beginner questions, that could be great.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.040
Definitely mention that sort of thing in your interview.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.660
So when a candidate comes in, ways that they can try to showcase their skill set.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.020
I mean, we have it in college.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.780
We have different types of learning, be it formal or non.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.680
But what I think I get most excited about is more side projects.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.920
Maybe someone started on something that isn't within their day-to-day role,

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.840
and they got really excited about it.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.800
And then they went out there and they wanted to learn more.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:58.140
So does someone have a side project like they were curious perhaps about how they could take a problem that maybe perhaps all developers have,

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.560
which is, you know, writing good documentation.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:05.240
You know, do they recognize a need that it's somewhat painful and or an afterthought to write documentation?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.380
And then they're like, okay, how can I write a tool that will make this better?

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.020
And then they turn that into a side project.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:23.580
Or maybe they're curious about machine learning and they've started taking a Coursera class and they're taking a project or a algorithm into their own and applying it to a project.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:31.400
I think ways that we learn, you know, you are passionate about exploring and learning outside and creating your own projects,

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:37.560
that really demonstrates initiative and really demonstrates a curiosity that I think is fundamental for coding.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.720
So side projects are really exciting to me.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.540
And also show the creativity of a developer.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.920
And then also open source contributions are pretty exciting as well.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.020
Particularly if someone has used a tool a lot and they start recognizing the holes or problems.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:26:02.820
Or even if they're saying, the way I learned how to use a project is I went through and started following bugs and started adding documentation to an open source project.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:11.060
Adding documentation to a project might seem like a small and insignificant thing, but actually can be quite useful and important.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:21.140
So really, you know, side projects, they may seem to be terribly overwhelming or large, but there's other ways you can go about doing it, finding a favorite tool and finding ways to contribute.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:27.420
So I think those are two ways that people can demonstrate things that they've worked on.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:36.320
Another thing that is definitely not required, but I am intrigued by, is seeing how people give back to the community at large.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.620
For example, are they participating as men?

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.540
Are they doing a mentoring program?

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:42.580
Do they act as a mentor?

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:49.460
The Chicago Python user group has a mentoring program, which I've really not heard many user groups doing.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:57.760
So it's exciting to see someone say they have a love for something and they're ready to give back, be it as a mentor or maybe even as a mentee, are they participating in one?

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.380
Giving talks at local user groups, giving talks at conferences.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:12.920
I think all those things are very interesting as well because it's going to show how they'll create community within your work environment and how they'll be contributing to the procurement of knowledge in days to come.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:21.100
It's important to have people who are looking to add to the conversation rather than just participating in the conversation as it exists.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.300
I think that everything matters.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.080
The more, the better.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:40.060
Because from my point of view and my experience hiring developers in Kazakhstan, usually people who are applying for their first job don't have anything to present.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.020
That's why it is very, very difficult to make right decision based on this.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.960
It starts looks like a Russian roulette.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:53.360
You start to rely on your intuition, which is not the good decision-making technique.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:28:00.320
And I would say that it is better to make mistake and not hire a good person rather than hire a wrong person.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:10.980
And that's why if a no previous job experience candidate shows his interest in terms of open source contributions, site projects, etc.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.800
It is definitely a big plus for him.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.760
And I would highly recommend to explore a wide range of open source projects.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:39.780
It is not the only best way to explore other programming code, but also opportunity to share your code and get feedback from more experienced developers, which is very important in real projects, where the majority of your time you spend with working with other experienced developers and working with the legacy code.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:51.080
So take a look at Django, take a look at Flask, requests, SQLAlchemy, and tons of excellent open source projects and start exploring and contributing to them.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:29:02.120
Practical experience with the language is critical, but we do desire candidates to have some formal education in software development, typically one to two years.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:13.500
That training can often establish good development habits, such as setting up good unit tests, exception handling, logging practices, and commenting standards.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:22.440
We like when candidates can present examples of that practical experience with the language, sample code, snippets, those types of things.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:37.900
We want to see what the packages they've imported, how they interact with those, and just to see what the forethought was for choosing those packages over other options, because there are many in the pip space.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:43.260
We want to see how the developer thinks about their code just as much as the code itself.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:48.900
We also require submission of unit tests as part of review in the process.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:30:01.200
Test-driven development is a critical part of our current development workflow, and it greatly improves our ability to resolve bugs quickly and discover as many of those as possible earlier in the sprints.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:14.420
Given that we support cloud platforms for our customers and those platforms are constantly evolving, we look for individuals who are capable of being flexible and dynamic as the languages and framework needs evolve.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.400
The reality is that tomorrow we may need different skill sets for another language entirely.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:28.620
So we look for individuals who love to learn and pick up new skills and are energetic and work well with others.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:36.540
What I'm looking for in general is anything that they did for themselves for fun.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:43.000
So, sure, code competitions, personal websites, little things they did like Project Euler type things.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:57.760
Open source contributions are always good, especially if it's related to the types of things we're doing, or even if it's not, because anyone, even an entry-level person, could have fooled around with something that no one else on the team knows and can enhance the team.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.860
Everyone can learn from everyone else.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:30:59.880
Everyone can learn from everyone else.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:26.120
This episode is brought to you by SnapCI, the only hosted cloud-based continuous integration and delivery solution that offers multi-stage pipelines as a built-in feature.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:34.620
SnapCI is built to follow best practices like automated builds, testing before integration, and provides high visibility into who's doing what.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.860
Just connect Snap to your GitHub repo and it automatically builds the first pipeline for you.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:46.140
It's simple enough for those who are new to continuous integration, yet powerful enough to run dozens of parallel pipelines.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.460
More reliable and frequent releases.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.380
That's Snap.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:55.400
For a free, no obligation, 30-day trial, just go to snap.ci slash talkpython.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:18.840
This fourth question is really about trying to compare and contrast the value of long-term education like four-year college degrees with hands-on experience.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:25.420
I hear from a lot of people that it's hard to get your first job out of college because people say you don't have any experience.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:30.340
But at the same time, if you don't have a college degree, maybe that's a stumbling block.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.860
So I ask everyone if they were presented with two candidates.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:41.080
One who has a really solid computer science degree but not a lot of experience because they've still been in school.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:48.200
And another with little formal education but a couple of years' experience working with the technology they're looking for.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:33:02.040
Like maybe you're hiring for a Python web job and this person has experience working with Flask and SQLAlchemy, talking to MySQL, and it's all running through Nginx and load balancing, all that kind of stuff.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.040
They've been doing that for two years, but they only graduated high school.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.380
How would you balance these two candidates?

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:13.820
Well, you know, I'm never going to decline solid formal education, of course.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:19.680
Solid formal education is great, and especially as you solve bigger and bigger problems, it can become more and more relevant.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:27.960
Big O notation, for example, is maybe not that relevant to you as you try to figure out how to search for a given IP address in a file with a thousand lines.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:38.760
But around the time that you try to generalize this to Netflix scale, you're probably really going to want to care about the difference between, say, ON and ON log N and cubed, for example.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:45.940
That said, we really are interested in problem solvers, and really what we're talking about there is practical problem solvers.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:55.380
And I'd rather see you having solved real-world problems rather than gotten good grades if I'm in the position of having to pick just one of these two options.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:09.960
And again, since we don't look at people's first job necessarily, the educational background for us is not particularly relevant in our both recruiting process, but also in terms of deciding who we're going to give offers to.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.940
I have people on my team who don't have degrees.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:18.540
I have people on my team with PhDs, and I have no idea where the people with PhDs got their degrees from.

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.580
It's never been relevant.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.300
Question number four, degrees.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.780
So this is an interesting question.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.320
Which one do I value more, or which one does the company value more?

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.060
Because management marketability really comes into it with large companies.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:41.160
Of the three hires I truly consider my star hires, none of them had a CS degree.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:46.500
One was electrical engineering, the other was math, and the final one was comparative literature.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:56.320
The things they all had in common, though, was just a voracious reading habit and extensive hours spent in some Python or POSIX environment.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.580
Computer science degrees aren't really necessary for the majority of enterprise work.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:06.480
Like I said before, environmental fluidity and willingness to read docs are far more important.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:12.440
A couple of CS classes will get you some useful vocabulary and teach you time complexity, though.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:19.960
As for the concept of a degree in general, if you want to work at a big company, it's a lot easier to get in with a bachelor's.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.080
You don't need much more than that.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:31.540
The right two years of experience can go a long way in terms of skills development, but in terms of management marketability, no degree raises a lot of eyebrows in those cases.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:41.260
So, in short, for enterprise software, my observation is that a computer science degree is about as good as a non-CS degree plus two years of experience,

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:46.660
which is about as good as no degree plus four to five years of experience at least.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:55.080
Most professors and academic programs don't give you all that much pragmatic knowledge, even if it's pretty old stuff like Emacs and terminal usage.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.160
Basically, everything is about how you approach your assignments in free time.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.260
If you push beyond the requirements, you will learn much more.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:07.160
So, if you're in school, take an operating systems class.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.020
Take a networking class.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.900
Maybe take a crypto class.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.960
You'll learn almost as much running a shared server in your dorm.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.900
Now, both of those are different types of knowledge, so consider doing both.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:26.420
If you're not in school, Coursera and other options are far better than nothing, and I'd like to hear about those experiences in interviews.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:35.700
So, for candidates that have computer science degrees and those who don't, I don't actually have a preference of one over the other.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:41.820
I think that something that's unique or maybe interesting about Sprout, we are a startup.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.720
We're about five years.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.720
We're in our fifth year here in Chicago.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.180
I think startups are interesting spaces because you get people with a broader background.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.180
At least that's been my experience.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:57.640
And when you have people who come from different backgrounds, you know, maybe someone who was both technical and was a lawyer.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:03.600
Or maybe someone came from a PhD that wasn't in computer science and went into programming.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.640
Or maybe someone who was a musician and came into that.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:11.260
Speaking of which, these are all examples of people I know and work with that have these types of backgrounds.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:17.740
These are some of the most exciting people to work with because their ways of breaking and approaching problems, they come from different vantage points.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:25.640
So, definitely, I think having the ability to speak about fundamentals is somewhat non-negotiable.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:31.840
You need to understand how to talk about the complexity of an algorithm and understand its performance.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.200
So, big O is important.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:38.800
You need to understand different types of data structures and what is applicable in an appropriate situation.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:48.480
And I think for people who don't have formal education, these are the type of things that you can learn over time or you can take the initiative to learn on your own.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:56.040
So, while a computer science degree is definitely a good indicator of someone's skill set, it's not the end all.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.380
You're looking for a nice combination of things.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:06.660
So, for people who don't have formal education, I think what's important is that they're continuing in their learning and how is it they're doing it.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.380
Are they participating in online learning?

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.140
Are they in different user groups looking for mentors?

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.360
Are they reading textbooks at home?

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.600
I think all that's really important.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:26.020
And really, for people who don't have the formal education, you can see people who are doing this when they get to the technical interview and they're breaking down problems.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:32.800
And you get to see how they think and how they evaluate the code that they would intend to write or whatever the problem is they're trying to solve.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.620
So, in a nutshell, both are great backgrounds.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:44.420
But I think it's how you continue that learning for people who don't have formal education that's going to help compensate for some of the knowledge you're missing.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:44.620
Yeah.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:49.300
So, the answer is, it depends.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:58.640
For example, a person with a solid computer science degree could also have a solid knowledge in a particular technology stack or domain and vice versa.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.760
And definitely, I would prefer that person.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:06.580
But the real world situation is a little bit harder than this.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:15.640
And I think that currently formal education is not the number one priority in terms of making decision to hire a candidate or not.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:20.160
But what really matters is the experience.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.500
Experience person reduces costs for businesses.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:27.500
Experience lowers entry barriers.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:39.040
Experience also reduces the likelihood of technical debt which this person could introduce, thereby decreasing the productivity of other developers.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:51.780
And nowadays, the gap between people who have a formal computer science education and those people who don't have is decreasing with the introduction of MOOCs.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.880
What is MOOC?

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.160
MOOC is a massive open online course.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:08.500
And platforms like Coursera, like Edex, like Udacity, MIT and so on, they provide tons of high quality courses free of charge.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:19.860
And I think that we are living a very, very special life where education is becoming cheap and affordable for everybody with the access to the internet.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:26.660
So, you can go there and start learning something new with thousands of students.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.420
That's a great opportunity.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.540
You can collaborate with them and you can help each other.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:49.600
If I had to choose between someone with a solid degree and no experience, and someone with a couple years experience but no degree, that really wouldn't give me enough information because neither one of those things tells me how a person is going to be in my group.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.440
If they're going to be a culture fit.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.140
If they're going to continue to learn.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.440
How much they really love what they do.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:03.380
One question I always like to ask is, if we made you an offer and you had an identical offer from another company.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:04.960
Same money, same everything.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.660
Why would you choose us?

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:12.100
I want someone who appreciates the environment of a startup and the type of people they'd be working with.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.760
The people that are interviewing them.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:19.240
Who talk about themselves during the interview to give them an idea of what we're like.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.080
And the main thing is a culture fit.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.220
Even if they didn't know Python.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:41.700
And beyond that, someone who really loves what they do, is willing to always learn, is always curious, is going to bring their ideas and things they discover out in the open source world into our company and make everyone better and make our product better.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.920
That is what I'm looking for.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.680
And the education and experience just don't matter.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.300
This last question was an optional one.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.700
I didn't want to put anybody on the spot.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.200
So I said, answer it if you want.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.640
Otherwise, just skip it.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.780
And a couple of our panelists answered it.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:03.000
And that question was, why did you hire the last person you hired?

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:12.940
And I ask this because it's great to talk in theory about comparing formal education versus experience versus side projects.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.940
But actions often speak louder than words.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:19.460
And in this case, I thought maybe we'd find something interesting.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:22.620
Well, you know, that's actually kind of funny.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:26.620
The last person I hired was someone who was interviewing for a manager position with us.

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.460
Actually, but we hired him for a position as an engineer.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:36.840
Because as we looked at what he was really interested in doing, he was passionate about technical innovation and was very, very strong in that area.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:44.820
He was interviewing for a manager position because he had been a manager before and was used to working in environments where the way you got to be technically innovative was to be a manager.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:51.020
Because as an IC, individual contributor, all you got to do was implement the technical decisions of your management chain.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.440
In our environment, it's actually exactly the opposite of that.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:43:01.940
So the IC position was a great fit for us and was a great fit for him and his passion and what he was actually interested in doing.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.140
And that's worked out really well for us and him so far.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:12.800
So I gave my most recent thumbs up to a developer who knew Django and was willing to continue working with it.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.340
But most importantly, he could start on site before the wreck closed.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.920
You see, in large companies, empty seats have expiration dates.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.020
And everyone is willing to gamble.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.700
Because somebody is better than nobody.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:31.920
And even if they're worse than nobody, then you still get a backfill when they leave or are pushed out.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.480
But this developer seems to be working out.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.220
And I only helped hire him for another team.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.720
So let me talk about one other one.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:43.300
The last engineer I hired onto my team was recruited over the course of two years.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.220
I met him at PyCon 2012.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:48.180
And we collaborated on a few open source projects.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:52.960
And, you know, eventually the planets aligned and he was able to join my team.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:59.020
Real recruiting can be a really long process, not the least of which is due to weird budgeting and bureaucracy.

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:02.840
So don't get frustrated if you're still waiting on an email reply from me.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:08.800
And do network and meet people and go to conferences and play that long game.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:15.480
One last piece of advice I usually give people as well is to, if you're really just looking for a job,

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.660
you want to get into the mix with the industry,

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.760
Just make sure that your LinkedIn profile exists and says that you are a software engineer.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.320
And then just change your location to the Bay Area or Seattle or some other tech hub.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:38.420
Actually, I hired a person just recently for about two or two and a half weeks ago.

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:46.300
This person is a young, smart guy without actually strong computer science formal education,

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:51.760
but with some little bit of working experience.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:56.760
Previously, he only worked in one place as a web developer.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:03.700
But the thing which makes him different from others is his passion for knowledge.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:10.040
I was amazed by his habit of reading books on a regular basis.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.560
He explores and learns different MOOCs.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:21.440
We just recently took the MOOC from Coursera, which is called Learning How to Learn.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.780
I highly recommend this course to listeners.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.060
Take a look.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.160
This course is very, very good.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.780
Learning How to Learn.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:35.080
And he's interested not only in computer-related subjects,

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:39.880
but, you know, other stuff like scientific, non-fiction, and so on.

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.720
And also, he reads tons of code from different open source projects

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.180
and making some contributions to them.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:52.100
Because I think that because of technology is a rapidly growing area,

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.520
everybody should stay hungry and be curious.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.160
Because we are lucky enough to be a part of something

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.100
which can change people's lives in a better way.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:09.100
And the idea of creating something that can be used by millions of people is fascinating.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:14.440
And people who are fascinated are willing to continuously improve themselves.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:21.580
And I wish everybody to be fascinated and improve their life and themselves in a better way.

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.200
Thank you very much.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.080
Rather than discuss why I hired any individual,

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.800
I'd rather talk about why I've hired my favorite people that I've hired.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.760
And there are many recurring reasons.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.520
And among them are they're interested in open source.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:44.260
They're interested in the community that brings us the tools that we use every day.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:47.180
They keep themselves up to date.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.520
They follow key people on Twitter.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.680
They're on mailing lists.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.560
They go to conferences.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.720
They follow blogs.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.200
They're interested in doing things the right way.

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.360
They follow the community's best practices.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.260
They use linters.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:04.260
They pay attention to style because it doesn't matter to a certain extent.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.140
If the code works, it matters that I have to be able to read it.

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:09.440
I have to be able to maintain it.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:16.700
Maintainability is by far the number one most important thing in programming, in my opinion.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:25.800
And someone who's not satisfied with meeting the requirements, someone who wants to make it better, they want to do it the right way.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:36.360
And I don't mean an ivory tower, unattainable perfection that it has to be done exactly textbook perfectly.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:41.500
Just it's done well enough that it's easy to maintain.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.160
It's easy for other people to understand.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.680
They're not taking egregious shortcuts.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.640
They leave the code better than they found it.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:57.400
And they're someone whose code review you want to do and someone you want to talk to at lunch about code and just generally hang out with.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.940
Well, that's it for the questions.

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:12.920
I really learned a lot, and I think I got a better picture of what it takes to be successful getting a developer job these days in general and getting a Python job in particular.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.400
So thanks so much to the panelists who contributed to this show.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:21.980
Before we wrap things up, Lorena and Mahmood had a few parting thoughts for us.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.960
Okay, that is my questions.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:33.180
And I guess just kind of as a last bit, I did like this question about advice for other new developers looking for their first job.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:37.320
So I'm going to be devil's advocate and add another response here.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.060
So for that in particular.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:49.120
So my advice to anyone who's a new developer looking for their first job, especially if you're someone who feels perhaps like maybe you shouldn't be in the field.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.900
Imposter syndrome is rampant.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:55.000
And I think many people feel like imposters, even if you've been coding since you were eight.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:00.780
I think what's really important is to understand the work environment you're going to be going into.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:04.460
First of all, you know, knowing the problem space that you'll be working in.

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:05.660
Is that interesting to you?

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:13.960
If you're a bit indifferent and are looking for just that first job in general, understand how you are as a person who codes.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.460
How do you learn best as a new developer?

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:23.720
If you're a junior and this is your first time looking for a development job, it's going to be important that you have good support.

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.620
So are there are there seniors that you compare with?

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:28.180
Are there seniors who will mentor you?

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:29.660
Is the place you're working?

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.640
Do they participate with lunch talks?

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.060
Do they do they care about hosting meetups?

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.160
There's a few ways you can gauge this.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:42.800
Or, you know, you can even ask to do a coffee with the company that you're possibly going to be interviewing at.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:51.480
All of these things are really good ways to if you able if you can if you can do a coffee with a developer on the team, if you can go to their space when they have a meetup.

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.160
All these are great ways to learn more about the team and the environment at large there.

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.160
So really best advice.

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.720
Be true to who you are.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.240
Know what you need in order to succeed.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.600
So set yourself up for success.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.200
Find a team that matches your style of learning.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.540
OK, I hope that helps.

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:08.280
Thank you so much.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.040
Thanks for doing this, Michael.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.200
I really can't thank you enough.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:23.240
You know, I'm so psyched to just start sending people links to this, you know, instead of having to, like, you know, go through this whole rant every single time.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.140
It varies a lot from person to person.

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:29.740
But really, everything that I put in here is, you know, pretty generalizable stuff.

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:34.380
And it's what I say to, you know, basically everyone who asks me this question.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.020
So really good work.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:37.240
Really good idea for a show.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.020
Really looking forward to hearing what the other people have to say.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:40.700
All right.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.360
Have a good day slash night.

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:42.840
Bye-bye.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.940
