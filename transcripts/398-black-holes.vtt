00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.760
The iconic and first-ever image of a black hole was recently released.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.680
It took over a decade of work and is a major achievement for astronomy

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.640
and broadens our understanding of the universe for all of us.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.740
Would it surprise you to know that Python played a major part in this discovery?

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.900
Of course it did, and Dr. Sarah Eisen is here to give us the full story.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.860

Sarah, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.540
Thank you so much.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.460
Thank you for having me.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.480
Yeah, I'm very excited to have you on the show.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.360
Ever since I saw that first picture of the black hole and heard the news,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.140
I didn't know, but I thought, oh, there has to be some Python going on here, huh?

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.940
Oh, yeah, definitely.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.080
We got a lot of traction from our Matplotlib press.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.300
That's soon to catch the eye of many developers.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.720
Oh, I see.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.140
It is.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.600
It is.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.980
It is.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.860
It is Python.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.280
I see.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.880
Look, there it is.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.700
I know that theme.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.340
That's right.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.640
Yeah.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.780
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.540
So there's just many fascinating aspects of this.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.260
The amount of data, the different data sources, the Earth scale telescope that you all created,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:17.800
the processing with the pipeline, Python, and just seeing stuff 55 million light years away

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.120
at all, which is dark, is kind of crazy.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.540
But before we get to all those fun topics, let's just hear your story.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.460
How do you get into programming and into the Python side of these things?

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.360
And how do you get going to black holes, too?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.460
Just to introduce myself.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.260
Hello, everyone.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.120
My name is Sarah.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.260
I'm currently a member of the Event Horizon Telescope Project, the team that makes images

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.000
of black holes.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.820
I've been interested in astronomy since I was a little kid.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.820
Since I was eight years old, I got to, in second grade, I got to build a cardboard forward

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.120
system.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.720
I'm sure everybody has kind of had similar experiences.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.960
That was really my first kind of introduction into a world outside of our planet.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.400
And I was just so fascinated by planets that I kind of binged through all of the astronomy

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.040
books I could find at my local library and fell in love with astronomy.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.660
And so I ended up studying kind of the physical sciences.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.620
I did a bachelor's in physics.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.100
And because I was doing a bachelor's in physics, I didn't have astronomy courses as part of my

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.540
program.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.940
So that was something that was pretty disappointing to me because I really wanted to do astronomy,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.220
but I couldn't quite do that yet.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.860
So as an undergrad, I decided to do a summer project in astronomy.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.420
So I emailed a professor or a number of professors working in astronomy in the Netherlands.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.320
And this professor responded a few minutes later to my email, which I sent during Christmas

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.680
holidays.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.240
So I was very surprised that he'd respond.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.820
And it turns out he said it was unusual for him to get emails from students wanting to do

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.560
work in the summer.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.720
So he thought, oh, come on by.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.840
I'll tell you about my project.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.080
And he told me he was one of the big leads of this amazing adventure to take an image of

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.700
a black horse.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.080
And I thought that was the coolest thing I'd ever heard.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.980
And I kind of jumped right in and undergrad and then continued my master's and PhD with the project.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.720
And I've been here ever since.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.740
And so Python, I got introduced to Python in undergrad for programming, simple data analysis.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.520
Although most of my undergrad was spent on C programming and MATLAB because it was very much

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.440
on the physics side.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.700
And this is mostly what physicists use.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.680
But then when I transitioned into an astronomy program in my master's and PhD, it was really

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.900
almost all Python.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.240
And so that kind of was kind of learned by doing kind of training that I had to do.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.860
I had to learn how to write.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.700
I didn't take any Python classes, really.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.500
Just kind of learn as I go with data processing analysis.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.680
Ended up playing a big part in the EHT results.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.620
And it really plays a big part in most astronomy data analysis lately.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.400
It seems like it's just taken over that world recently, at least for the analysis side, right?

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.300
Maybe not running on devices, right?

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.860
There's probably, I don't think there's any Python running on, say, JWST.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.000
But maybe some of the earthbound telescopes have some in play.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.420
I don't know.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.920
Yeah, a lot of the data processing and analysis is done in Python.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.020
A lot of visualizations are also done in Pythons.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.800
So it's become a very kind of versatile and flexible tool for us to quickly kind of make figures

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.420
for papers, as many people have noticed in our papers, our kind of major kind of matplotlib tools

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.660
that we use to display our data.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.180
Exactly.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.960
I think it's just completely taken over that space, which is really neat.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.640
And I think the Python world is much better for having all of these scientists and folks

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.500
with other backgrounds using it for whatever they're interested in, right?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.280
It's not just, well, here's how Instagram uses it.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.680
And here's how this other API company uses it, right?

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.760
There's a much more diverse mosaic of interests and things people want from the language.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.300
Absolutely.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.920
I think one of the big strengths that we drew from Python was really the open source community.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:07.060
There are many open source codes available that we were able to make use of in astronomy that

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.800
were not necessarily designed for astronomy data science purposes.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.720
But that just happened to be really useful for what we were trying to do with the data.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.640
And so it ended up saving us an enormous amount of time.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.880
And so whenever we speak about our project, I tried to make a big point of saying that we do rely a lot on the open source

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.460
development community, which I think is a part of the developer community that is often overlooked.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:43.260
And that is really important to support open source work because a lot of it is done by students and postdocs who are in the sciences, who just happen to need code to do a certain thing.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.500
And they make it available.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.300
And it turns out to have many different uses in other people's science.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.140
And so we really build on the shoulders of all these people.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.800
And it saves so much time.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.060
Yeah.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.160
Like Matplotlib or Pandas or a lot of these are general purpose, right?

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.520
Yeah.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.320
So you gave a really great presentation, a keynote at PyCon 2022.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.560
And I'll be sure to link that and we'll pull some ideas out of there.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:16.400
Before we get to really into the programming and Python side of things, give us maybe just a little bit of history of black holes.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.000
You know, a lot of this starts with Einstein, right?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.580
And as soon as you see that dip, well, if there's enough gravity here, but what have you put more?

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.340
And what have you put more?

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.840
Like how steep can that curve get until it, then stuff falls into it and it gets steeper, right?

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.140
Like give us the history.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.600
History starts, I think in the 1700s, even before Einstein.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:43.480
There was this runner, Reverend Mitchell, who thought about this idea of, say, when you have kind of something trying to leave the Earth's gravity,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.160
it has a specific escape speed in order to leave the Earth's gravity.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:55.260
And no matter the size and weight of the object trying to leave, it always has the same escape speed because it depends on the gravity of the Earth.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:04.500
So he thought what would happen if you would kind of make the Earth so heavy, so compact that the escape speed would become higher than the speed of light.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:12.720
And so he thought he made this thought experiment and he found out that by having the speed being higher than the speed of light,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:19.480
this star that you collapse ends up being dark because all of the light that is at its surface cannot escape.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.800
So you can't see it anymore.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.160
If it doesn't get to your eye, you cannot see it.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.160
So you end up with a dark star.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.200
And that was this kind of thought experiment that led to being a black hole.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.820
This dark star is actually a black hole.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:37.620
So even in the 1700s, you know, philosophers, you know, religious people like Reverend Mitchell thought about these ideas,

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.720
about what it could look like if you had such an object.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.140
And these objects often seemed, well, this was just a thought experiment.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:52.920
And then when Einstein came along, he tried to describe space and time and gravity in a single unifying theory and ended up the theory of general relativity.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:09:03.740
That was in 1915 when he showed that light was actually affected by gravity so that light would bend around heavy objects because of this bend in the space time.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:11.520
And then a year later, Carl Schwarzschild found the first kind of real solution to Einstein's theory, to Einstein's equations,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:19.120
which ended up in what we call the singularity, which showed that there is this object that is kind of a hole in the space time.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.300
And this object has a horizon, which we call the event horizon.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.700
And the size of the horizon, the radius is called now the Schwarzschild radius after Carl Schwarzschild.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:36.020
And it showed that anything that goes beyond this horizon can never come back because the escape speed at the horizon is the speed of light.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.060
So anything that goes beyond would need an escape speed higher than the speed of light.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.080
So, and light is the fastest thing that goes.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.600
So nothing.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:48.080
Circle around and just kind of just somehow, probably still move, but still be trapped within that space.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.540
Exactly.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.120
So you can never, once you cross that point, you can never come back.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:58.980
And at that time, so people thought a lot about the theory of Einstein and this mathematical object that we call the singularity.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:04.120
At the time they thought, okay, black holes are a mathematical object, but there's no way they could be real, right?

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:09.840
So people thought, okay, mathematically, that's so interesting, but these things can't exist in the universe.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.400
And then in the 1930s, Chandrasekhar, famous Indian astronomer, he thought about the mass of stars.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.920
So they're, you know, stars when they die, they become white dwarfs.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.180
And so they die in these kind of stellar dead stars.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.500
But then he thought, what about more massive stars?

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.660
Stars are much heavier.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.380
It turns out that he calculated it and white dwarfs have a maximum mass.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:39.320
So there are certain classes of heavier stars that could never end up as white dwarfs because they would collapse to something more massive than a white dwarf.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.640
So it could not be a white dwarf.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.200
And it turns out what they collapsed into is a black hole.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:49.380
And this was the very first evidence that black holes could exist in reality, in the universe.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.280
But they're kind of an inevitable endpoint for hemi stars.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.120
But since then, people have been thinking about where to find them.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:03.520
And people have been detecting these powerful streams of gas coming from centers of galaxies that could only be powered by a black hole.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:09.380
And the galaxy M87, that's 55 million light years away from us, does have one of these big streams.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:17.680
So that and that was the very first stream of gas from a center of a galaxy ever observed by humanity in 1980.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.640
Didn't know that it was going to be a black hole at the time.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:27.280
But then there was more and more evidence that the only thing that could really power this really powerful process had to be a black hole.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:33.080
So we started then the story of trying to understand what they would look like from an observer point of view.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.580
How big does the black hole have to be for us to be able to see it from Earth?

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.980
How big do we design a telescope that could see it?

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.660
And it turns out there are only two black holes in the sky that are reachable with the telescope the size of the Earth.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.440
That's our maximum size that we could go.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.800
And one is this black hole in M87, which we imaged in 2019.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:59.080
And then the second one is our very own black hole in our Milky Way, Sagittarius star, which we imaged in 2022, just last May.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.160
Oh, do you have pictures published of that?

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.120
Yeah, that's right.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.400
It came out on May 12, 2022.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.600
Yeah, just two weeks after my PyCon talk.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.160
Oh, that's what I mean.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.600
Yeah, it was frustrating not to be able to say anything.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.220
So I kept telling people, you know, oh, please watch Earth news.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.640
And we have exciting stuff coming.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.860
But I couldn't say anything.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.000
We have more pictures.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.740
I'm sure.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.120
I know.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.760
I've seen them.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.260
Yeah.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.100
It's also worth pointing out this whole project that you were on.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.900
It's a long running project.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.560
Yes.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.680
It went from when did it start?

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:31.960
I know.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.560
Yeah.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:39.140
Kind of the technology part started in the late 90s and then actually starting to add more and more

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.680
telescopes started in 2007.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:51.080
So it is about a 10 year process between the first telescopes that joined and then the 2017 campaign in which we had finally enough telescopes to take the data to make images.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.900
So about 10 years of building.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.080
And we're still building.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.340
We're still adding more telescopes.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.880
We've added three more since then.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.140
Yeah.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.260
So this is called the Event Horizon Telescope.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.140
And it's a planet scale telescope.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:09.900
I mean, I just saw a whole bunch of news and cool pictures from JWST, James Webb Space Telescope.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.240
Yeah.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.540
It's huge, but it's only like 30, how many meters across?

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.160
30 feet?

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.280
Some number of meters?

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.000
12 meters?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.400
I don't know.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.860
It's not planet sized.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.340
No.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.460
How do you build a planet sized one?

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:32.620
We use a very clever trick that is called interferometry that actually won the Nobel Prize back in the 70s by Martin Ryle, who designed this technique.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:40.840
And what we do is, in fact, it would be great to have a telescope the size of the Earth that we could build, like a giant Death Star in space that we could look at.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.400
It would save us so much trouble.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:48.540
But it turns out convincing funding agencies to give us that kind of money wasn't really possible.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.120
So we had to use this clever technique of interferometry.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:59.060
And what we do with our technique is we sync up telescopes that are at strategic locations around the Earth.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.300
They have to observe at the exact same time.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:07.040
And they're timed accurately by atomic clocks that are so precise, they lose about a second every million years.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.880
And so these clocks time-

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.600
They're big too, right?

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.420
They're like-

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.220
They're not the size of a mini fridge.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:12.600
Yeah.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.300
Wow, okay.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:13.640
Yeah.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.600
They're big and they're very expensive.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.000
So we have to take really good care of them.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.860
So there's one at each of our telescopes that time-tags the data as it arrives at each site.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.840
And then we record that data onto hard drives.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:36.080
And then we ship those hard drives to a central computer in which all of the data from all the telescopes are combined and aligned together to synthesize a virtual telescope that finds the Earth.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.260
So that's how we do it.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:42.620
The telescope is not physically the size of the Earth, but we synthesize it using telescopes that span-

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.660
the size of the Earth.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:43.980
Right.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.920
So kind of like little different sensors at 10, 15 locations.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.460
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.680
But you have to keep them in sync.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.760
That's the big problem, right?

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.120
Yeah.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.500
And timing is everything for what we do.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:53.960
Yeah.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.180
Yeah.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.340
And you think about how off can you be.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.800
And you're talking the speed of light.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.940
A little, a microsecond, you cover a lot of distance in that time and the speed of light, right?

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.460
That's right.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:02.760
Yeah.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:10.420
We have to be extremely accurate because any shift in time between signals means that we're no longer in the reference frame of the black hole.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.720
Everything that we see has to be in the reference frame of the black hole.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.000
So it all has to be exactly aligned at the same time.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:27.000
And there are many, many different aspects in the instrumentation of each telescope that needs to be measured very accurately and corrected at the time of combining the signals.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.800
And then we also go through a very lengthy data processing step in which we correct all the additional effects.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:41.660
We also have to deal with the earth atmosphere because we observe such a high frequency in the radio, which is 230 gigahertz, dealing with very high frequency radio waves.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.740
And they're very affected by the atmosphere.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.920
So water vapor and instability in the atmosphere can scramble and destroy our signal.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:54.840
So we have to correct it after the fact and kind of model the atmosphere at each site, remove it.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.060
And then we can average our data down and build signal that way, build signal to noise.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.420
And then finally, at the end of that, all that processing is where imaging comes in.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:10.140
And then we can combine the data with our imaging softwares and then reconstruct images that best fit the data.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:14.520
Yeah, you had a really cool visualization showing how obviously the earth is curved.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.240
I liked how you tried to reinforce that with folks.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.140
I really hope now that the earth is round.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.320
Otherwise, it would make our job very weird.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.600
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Cox Automotive.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.380
Cox Automotive isn't a car company.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.300
It's a technology company that's transforming the automotive industry.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.880
The team at Cox Automotive understands the future of car buying and ownership.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:48.900
And they're looking for software developers, data engineers, scrum masters, and other experts to help make that happen.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:56.960
If you're interested in innovating with brands like Kelly Blue Book, Auto Traders, and others, then you should check out Cox Automotive.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.140
Just visit talkpython.fm/cox to find out more.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.600
Thank you to Cox Automotive for sponsoring the show.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:11.820
Yeah, we definitely have to take into account the curvature of the earth because of this delay in curvature.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:18.320
Two telescopes far enough apart have to deal with the earth's curvature because then the signal doesn't arrive at the same time at each place.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.640
It arrives down here earlier than arrives here.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.600
And so we have to take into account this curvature difference to make the signal be at the exact same time.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.820
And we do that at the simple computer stage.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.680
Yeah. So maybe let's follow the data for a minute because I think that that's pretty interesting.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.340
So it starts by things hit the different telescopes.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.780
How many did you say were involved at the time?

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.480
Yeah. Eight.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.700
Eight telescopes at six different locations.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.700
Yeah, you got these eight different telescopes and they're all at different points on the earth.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:50.920
So the signal's hitting them at different times just because it's not a lot of time difference,

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.700
but it's enough to make a difference in the light waves or the radio waves.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.860
But then the next step gets pretty interesting.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:03.780
Because it's not like we're using our fiber, our gigabit connection to upload the data.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:09.620
You record it to a huge block of hard drives and you physically send the hard drives, right?

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.640
Yes, that's right.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.660
Yeah, they're basically just standard kind of helium drives that we use just stacked together,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.140
the kinds that are in laptops.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.700
And then we record our data onto these hard drives.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:26.460
They're kind of split into random folders with some names that I can't decipher,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.880
people who work at their computer supercomputers do.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.400
And then we pack them up.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:36.440
We drive them down each mountain and then ship them, usually via FedEx or UPS,

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.280
to our two central correlation facilities where we combine the data.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.780
One is at MIT Haystack in Boston, right here.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.600
And then one is in Bonn, Germany at the Max Planck Institute for Radiostromy.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.000
So they get half the data and they get half the data.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.360
Yeah.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:57.560
And there's one guy who used to be a police officer who is now in charge of logistics of

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.040
the data.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.240
That's right.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:58.560
Right?

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:58.920
Yeah.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:04.360
I always like telling the story of Don because Don Souza used to be a police officer for the

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.140
state of Massachusetts.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:10.580
And then since then, for the last 20 years, he's been dealing with the shipments for MIT

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.580
Haystack Observatory.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.120
And all of the data goes for him, including the ones that go to Bonn.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.240
And he's been doing this for years.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.560
And he is our main shipping guy for the EHT.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.780
And he's never lost a single package.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:24.720
That's incredible.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.180
Yeah.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.420
There was just one, I think, funny mishap that happened once where we had a package

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.520
incoming from the South Pole that was meant to be our South Pole equipment.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.480
And then he opened it and it was just a bunch of fabric.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.720
That was a little bit of an issue.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.580
Silk?

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:39.640
Yeah.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.660
I don't remember if it was silk, but I think it's just regular fabric.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.640
But then luckily, the help of the shipping company, the mishap was found.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.600
And then the fabric went to the rightful owner.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.900
And then the equipment got returned to us.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.300
So everything went well.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.060
Yeah.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:57.620
You're like, they didn't get what they expected and we definitely didn't.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.520
That's right.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.060
How bad would it have been if you had lost it?

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.360
Would it have been catastrophic or would it have been just...

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.240
So it wasn't data.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.440
It was just a piece of equipment.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.400
It would have been expensive to get another one and go through the test.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.080
And they would have probably delayed a couple of things.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.580
But other than that, it would not have been catastrophic.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.020
Yeah.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:19.580
The other thing I think is interesting, as you said, the color code, the hard drives with green

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.340
ready to record and empty and red being awful.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.480
And they got to be processed.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:23.880
Yeah.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:29.400
We have little round stickers on our modules that have the hard drives that color code.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:29.740
Yeah.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.140
Yeah.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:30.720
Yeah.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.080
I mean, why not, right?

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.380
You want to look over and see like, oh, that pile, that pile is going out, not coming in.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.040
Exactly.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:37.640
Yeah.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:43.220
And often at the sites, we have spare modules that we have just in case we have issues recording

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.480
onto certain ones.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.820
So it's good to know which ones we've recorded on and which ones are spare.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.080
Yeah.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:53.220
So there's a lot of data here, which is why you ship the hard drives.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:53.420
Yeah.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:53.820
Yeah.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.220
Yeah.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.940
If you had a couple of gigabytes, nobody wants to ship hard drives, right?

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.180
That's, they can break, they can get lost.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.380
It's relatively slow unless you have petabytes of data.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.080
Yeah.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.840
And then all of a sudden you realize this is actually a problem.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.260
I've been just doing some backups of all the podcast episodes and stuff that I did.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:16.540
And they're like 20 gigs per episode and there's hundreds of, you know, 700.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.840
I've been uploading for days, for four or five days.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.880
I'm only through one of the podcasts for part of the time.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.540
I'm like, this is insane.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.940
And I'm so excited to appreciate just like, how hard is it to send this much data?

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.300
So when you're talking petabytes, and these are remote locations as well for the satellites

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.000
often, right?

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.240
So maybe not the best connection.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:36.600
Yeah.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:42.600
And I think it would be pretty much unfeasible to send data from our site, especially the

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.620
South Pole is our most remote location.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:49.000
And during the South Pole winter, the internet is not very good.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.580
So we have to rely on some satellite connections that happen twice a day.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:58.500
And so the connections are about fast enough that it would take about 40 years to get all

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.240
the data from the South Pole that we take during our campaign.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.460
So it's really just not feasible.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.780
Our founding director always says that you cannot beat the bandwidth of a 747 sold with

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.360
hard drives.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.840
So shipping is always the best.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.300
Yeah, that's incredible.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.420
But apparently, apparently true.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.020
Yeah.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.420
Yeah.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.920
So we have a picture, right?

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.680
We have this amazing picture of the black hole.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.280
We'll talk about the story about how we get it, but maybe just describe it for people.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.660
I'm sure everyone has seen it, but it's maybe been a couple of years.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:29.980
Yeah.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.980
So this is a picture of the M87 black hole, what we call the first image of a black hole.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.560
We released this picture in April 2019.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.400
So three years ago now.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.880
And this picture comes from our 2017 observing campaign.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:49.700
And it is of the central black hole inside the galaxy M87, which is 55 million light years

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.380
away from us.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.720
So the light you're looking at in this picture is 55 million years old, which is pretty cool.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:01.140
And when it left the black hole, the first mammals were starting to appear on planet Earth.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:01.640
Wow.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.760
That's amazing.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.560
That's pretty cool.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:03.860
Yeah.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.180
So what we're seeing in the middle is this kind of dark patch, which we call the black hole shadow.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.580
And there's this big ring of light around it.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.500
And the dark patch is where the black hole is inside.

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:20.660
And the reason why it's dark is because inside there's the black hole event horizon, which is actually a little bit smaller than the shadow.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:29.600
And the path of the light rays that are around the event horizon makes the darkness in which the light can no longer escape and makes it puff up.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.360
And so the light rays kind of graze a bigger area, which is why the shadow is actually bigger than the event horizon.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.680
And then this ring of light around it is very, very hot gas.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:46.400
So we're talking billions of degrees, a hot gas swirling around in the black holes, either accretion disk or bottom of the famous jet.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.240
And this gas is swirling around so much that it's glowing.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.940
And it emits light in the radio, which are those radio waves that we observe.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.820
And so this is light that hasn't crossed the event horizon.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:04.280
It's not close enough to be purled in into the darkness and not being able to come out.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.680
But it's just close enough to show us this shadow of the black hole.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.480
It illuminates the darkness.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.700
So there's all this mass that's been attracted, but it's like whipping around, kind of like a toilet bowl, right?

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.460
The water is not just shooting through the hole.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.100
It's kind of spinning, but it's spinning near the speed of light.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.380
And there's lots of friction and stuff, which makes it glow, right?

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.000
That's right.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:23.460
Yeah.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.540
And what about the jet?

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:30.440
Does the jet come from this accretion disk or does it somehow come out of the black hole or where does it come from?

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.160
I mean, it can't, right?

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.420
Yeah.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.560
It doesn't come out of the black hole, but it does come pretty close to the black hole.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:49.020
So this image in particular didn't teach us too much about the jet other than we can't see it in our image because at the time we didn't have enough telescopes to see the jet because it's very, very faint at the frequency we're looking at.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:25:06.780
But our polarization image, which came out in 2021, which showed kind of a more spiral structure on top that trace magnetic field around the black hole, showed us that the magnetic fields around the black hole are kind of in a spiral shape that twist enough and are ordered enough to be able to launch the jet.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:14.600
So they're coming from the rotation speed of the black hole that makes the kind of the space time twist and the magnetic fields twist.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.980
And that is launching the jet.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.300
Okay.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:16.960
Amazing.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:25.060
I was just thinking last night, getting ready for this and doing some of the research, you know, the black hole, the lights and light and all that stuff goes into it.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:25.900
All this matter.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.200
And it's completely dark.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:32.900
But inside, it must have an insane amount of light and energy somehow in there, right?

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.660
Like if you could get into it, it must be really bright.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:40.080
If none of the light ever created can ever leave, it must just be building up in there.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.020
It's hard to tell.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.460
It would be hard to explain what you would see inside.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.880
Once you fall in, space time is getting stretched like crazy.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:57.440
The more in you go, the more stretch it gets because it inevitably should end up in the singularity in which all of space and time is compressed into a single point.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.760
So everything is kind of shifted and spaghettified.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:07.020
And so even the light ahead of you, you wouldn't be able to see it because it can never travel back in the direction where you are.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:12.660
So whenever you're falling, whatever's in front of you, you cannot see because it cannot go out.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.860
It can only go in.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.620
And so...

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.660
Yeah, maybe more like time stops and there's nothing.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.480
Maybe it's not that bright, huh?

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:18.760
Yeah.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:25.220
If you look back behind you at the horizon and at the outside, you would see the entire history of the universe.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:25.680
Yeah.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.060
It's kind of a...

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.480
It's a very mind-boggling place.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.240
And I think people do get very creative about what could happen inside a black hole, what you would see.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.520
There are a lot of thought experiments around it.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.680
But obviously, because of the physical boundary that is the event horizon, we can never know what is beyond.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.800
I often get this question in talks like, well, what you show us is just the shadow of the black hole.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:56.600
It's not the actual black hole itself, which I think is not a true question because I don't think the statement is true because this is everything we can see of the black hole.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.520
It is the black hole in the only way we can see it.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.300
Whatever is inside, we can never see.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.960
So this is always a picture of a black hole.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:04.620
This is it.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.300
This is absolutely it.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.720
Yeah, this is as far as you can go.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.180
You cannot go further.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.900
Mellie in the audience says, whoa, that is weird.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:11.600
I agree.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.060
It definitely is weird.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:30.240
I think we get a lot of very emotional reactions whenever we talk about kind of the whole aspect of looking at this image and what it represents, this end of space and time, this kind of point of no return and this whole kind of world of what is beyond it, what is outside of it.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.560
Yeah, very strange.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:41.040
All right. So back to following the data along, we've got petabytes of data collected to these hard drives on site at these six different locations.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:46.660
They get shipped to the two places in Cambridge, in the U.S. and in Bonn, Germany.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:47.780
And then what happens?

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:56.100
Yeah. And then once all of the disks arrive, they get plugged into the kind of readout machines that kind of read out all the data from all the different sites.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:12.280
And then we have supercomputers that align the data using a bunch of it's a very complicated machine, but it takes into account the Earth's curvature, a model of the Earth, the positions of the telescopes, different instrumentation effects that we measure at the sites that get put into this big model.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:33.040
So that we record at the telescope is kind of all of the signal the telescope receives, which includes signal from the black hole, but also the atmosphere, the surroundings, the air, the instrument and stuff.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:41.040
But because the only thing the telescopes have in common is the black hole signal, the rest of the data doesn't what we call doesn't correlate.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.960
So it is not seen in common.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:52.920
So at that point, a lot of the data that's noise can we can get rid of because we only care about what the telescopes see in common, which is what comes from space.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:29:02.100
And so then we can reduce the data from petabytes to like the kind of hundreds of gigabytes level, terabyte, gigabyte level.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:08.460
And then at that point, after the correlation, the data are ready to move on to the data calibration stage.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:17.580
So we end up with kind of data files per observing day of about maybe 100 gigabytes, 300 gigabytes, kind of manageable for software.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:17.980
Right.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:18.580
Yeah.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.240
You could transfer it over the Internet sort of levels of data.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:22.720
Kind of.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:22.960
Yeah.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.560
So usually we can put it on a common archive.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.280
That's where we have it stored, the correlated data.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:34.540
And then the data teams go in and get the data and then process them through their software.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.780
And we use cloud computing facilities to do data processing as well.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.320
It really speeds up things.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:40.760
I bet.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:47.220
These are like big supercomputers in those two locations, not like AWS or Azure, is it?

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.520
No, they're at the locations.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.160
That's right.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:49.580
Yeah.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:49.940
Yeah.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.620
They're basically computer clusters.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.060
Are these shared computers?

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.680
Are they dedicated especially for this job or are they more general?

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.740
They're dedicated especially for dealing with radio interferometry data.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.820
Necessarily, they're not used all the time by us.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.080
They're also used a lot by geodesy experiments.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.000
So geodesy is the science of studying tectonic plates on Earth.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.500
So they basically do the exact opposite to us.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:19.520
They use telescopes at different locations on Earth, looking at a common source that doesn't change.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:24.300
And then that way they can track the movement of the locations of the telescopes on Earth.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.500
And they do these observations many, many times.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.960
And that's where they get all combined.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:36.480
And in fact, through geodesy, that's how they get the model of the Earth that we use in our experiment to correct for this movement of the telescope.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.780
So there's a kind of very nice cycle that happens at the same location.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.260
Yeah.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.040
Yeah, that is a sympathetic cycle.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:43.760
That's great.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.500
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Sentry.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.380
How would you like to remove a little stress from your life?

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:57.360
Do you worry that users may be encountering errors, slowdowns, or crashes with your app right now?

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.400
Would you even know it until they sent you that support email?

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:05.180
How much better would it be to have the error or performance details immediately sent to you,

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:10.820
including the call stack and values of local variables and the active user recorded in the report?

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.240
With Sentry, this is not only possible, it's simple.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.800
In fact, we use Sentry on all the Talk Python web properties.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:24.360
We've actually fixed a bug triggered by a user and had the upgrade ready to roll out as we got the support email.

It's in this calibration stage where Python starts to make its appearance, right?

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.200
Yeah.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:14.180
So we have our data processing softwares are, I think, mostly built in, let's see, Fortran and C code.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.820
So more of the kind of heavier data crunching parts.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.480
And then there are a number of kind of post-processing tasks that do use Python.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:29.160
Especially we have a kind of suite of post-processing tasks that make use of pandas a lot.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:37.860
Because it offers a very neat data structure that allows us to organize data correction across, you know, kind of different columns of types of data.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.820
And that's been very helpful for us.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.060
Yeah.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:43.980
You also get a lot of the matrix multiplication, vector math type of features from there, right?

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.460
Yeah.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:44.540
Yeah.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.800
It's very helpful.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:51.600
And it has made our data processing a lot cleaner to do it through that data structure.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:33:05.780
Now, this cycle where you take the data, you factor out the atmosphere and other interference, and then you add in all the good parts of the signal, the positive parts of the signal from the different telescopes.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.280
You analyze it.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:12.860
You said that this cycle goes around a couple of times and takes like a year and a half or something, right?

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.220
Yeah.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:25.620
So from the time we took the data, which was in April 2017, to the time we released this image in April 2019, about one and a half years of that time was spent on the data processing.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:30.540
And the feedback loop between our correlation centers and the data processing team.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.660
I was part of the data processing team.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:45.920
We're quite a small team working kind of around the clock on a pretty fast turnaround, just because we had kind of a lot of data issues identified at each site that needed to be run down and then going back upstream and then back down.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:54.360
And we also had a feedback cycle with the imaging team that looked at early versions of the data and then discovered issues and then again going back upstream.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:34:01.240
So there was a long process of really trying to fix all of the instrumentation parts that would contaminate the black hole data.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:07.040
And then eventually we finally had a data set mature enough that would allow for actual imaging.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:12.660
And then once that was done, we were dealing with data files in the kind of 100 megabyte sizes.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.900
After data processing, we could really average our data down.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.800
So we're dealing with complex numbers.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.600
The data we get from the black hole are complex visibilities.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.120
They have an amplitude and a phase.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.240
Like 7 plus 2i, complex in that sense?

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:26.760
Exactly.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.520
Yes.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:27.980
Yeah.

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:37.420
And so because we have complex numbers, if we try to average numbers in which the phase part don't align, we end up destroying our signal because of destructive interference.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:44.400
So we needed to align the phases in order to average down our signal to have constructive interference and build up signal.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.100
And that's really the key part of the data processing.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.260
That's what we do in order for the imaging teams to have the best data possible.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:56.300
And then in the kind of 100 megabytes data, then we move on to our imaging software.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:56.940
Indeed.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.160
Quick question from the audience.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:07.560
What sort of wait times do you experience when you're iterating this step when you're sort of working in, say, a Jupyter Notebook and you press run?

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.520
How long until you see the results?

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:09.820
I guess.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.920
What's the experience of working like this?

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.900
Is it a lot of batch processing and you walk away for lunch?

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.780
Or is it small enough that you're getting immediate responses?

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:19.260
Yeah.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:24.220
So I think outside of the Python packages is where we run most of the big data crunching.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:29.740
I think in those parts, it would take a couple of days to run through our calibration pipeline.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.040
And the Python parts would take maybe a couple hours.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:46.480
Then when we're running diagnostic Jupyter Notebooks, it would take maybe not long because then at that point, we're basically in the 100 megabyte parts just doing data checks in which we make use a lot of Jupyter Notebooks, in fact.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:52.060
And math plot will have to plot through our entire data steps and cross-check every part.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.300
We have all these diagnostic notebooks that look at our data.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.200
And those don't take much time to generate.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:03.260
I would say maybe 20 minutes would generate kind of a single switch from a Jupyter Notebook.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:03.580
Sure.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.980
Very interesting.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.020
So most of the work is done by this supercomputer and seeing Fortran.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:15.020
And then you kind of are working with the raw answers in just numerical form, but you want them visualated.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.200
You want them correlated or things like that.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:17.460
Yeah.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:25.460
And then when we're really looking to diagnose our data to find instrumentation errors, then visual representations are extremely useful.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:35.520
And we've made a lot of use of kind of Jupyter Notebooks, especially in our data processing checks, to make sure everything looks good at each step of the pipeline.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:35.840
All right.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.520
One more audience question, then I'll move on.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:45.060
Mellie asks, do you do logging or any staging to keep track of the stages they're at and not in a loop?

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:45.340
Yeah.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:57.600
So each data pipeline has multiple stages in which we have kind of checkpoints at each stage where we have a suite of kind of Jupyter Notebooks or our suite of plots generated so that we can go back.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:07.680
If there's an issue, we can go back in each stage and look at the outputs and make sure that we can generate or we can identify where the issue has happened or when the failure has occurred.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.200
We have logs also of every process that comes in.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.320
We also do very strict version control of each kind of software version.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:25.500
Every time we run something, we do have a kind of version control package of all the software within one single pipeline run that we keep track of as well.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:29.400
That's really interesting because you want to have reproducibility, right?

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:30.340
Absolutely.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:35.580
Maybe something minor changed about the way Pandas does floating point operations.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.520
I'm just making this up.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.760
But, you know, theoretically over versions and give you a slightly different answer, right?

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.900
So you want to have a really clear snapshot of the entire system, right?

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:45.420
That's right.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:50.020
And this was also very important for us when we released the papers for this image.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:38:06.060
We also released the version controlled pipelines, both on the data side and on the imaging side that contained, you know, the exact version and kind of container form of the software that we use and the scripts that we used to generate these exact results.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:06.580
Oh, awesome.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.960
So this won the Nobel Prize, right?

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.780
It did not.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.100
It did not?

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:11.860
No.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.840
I'm sorry.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.840
I don't know why I thought I did.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.820
No, we won the breakthrough prize in physics in 2019.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.760
It won the heart and the minds though.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:26.180
So you did point out in your talk about how much this made a splash among people who are not scientists.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:37.320
Yeah, that was something that was very shocking for us because when we building up the project, obviously we had talked about the projects in various media forums and it was interesting in the astronomy community.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:42.060
So we knew there was some traction about the project that people would be interested in the results.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:48.640
But we did not expect the magnitude at which this image would really go into pop culture.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:54.840
Especially the fact that the next day after this release, it was on front pages of newspapers around the world.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:03.120
Just really unusual for science results, especially around times around these times when 19 was not, you know, the most happy of years.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.900
There was plenty of other stuff to occupy the news.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.440
So it's definitely unusual.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:14.400
And, you know, it ended up kind of trending number one on Twitter, which is, again, really surprising for science news.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.440
We did not have a trending campaign, really.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.840
We didn't prepare a hashtag.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.920
It was not something we were not really social media savvy kind of people.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.880
So it was it was not planned.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.380
It just kind of organically happened.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.760
And then there were so many memes and references.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:33.360
And we were kind of referenced on talk shows and documentaries and news segments.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.060
So it was really beyond anything we had expected.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:42.820
And there was a lot of demand also to hear from us, not just from astronomy or physics, you know, academics,

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:48.640
but also a lot of demand from planetariums and science camps and even museums.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:53.540
We did a bunch of talks at museums, which was really enjoyable and kind of reached to a different audience.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.320
And that was all really cool.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.000
I think really nice experience to kind of reach out to the community and make sure that people are part of it,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.520
because these science results happen in very big teams.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.420
And not just that, our teams are funded by taxpayer dollars.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:14.900
They build on resources from various communities, including, you know, the developer community in programming and instrumentation community.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.100
And, you know, all the giants and physics that came before us.

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:22.600
So it's really not just kind of a personal victory as a member of our team.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.080
It's kind of a global effort.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:30.560
And we want to make sure that we send a signal that teamwork is really a global thing and that big science happens in big teams.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.680
And not everybody's playing a part in this in some way.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.260
Are you familiar with the Mars rover GitHub?

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:41.540
Not the rover itself, but the Mars, the badge, I guess it's called.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.100
No, I don't think so.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.780
People got this for the people who worked on.

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:46.500
Where is this?

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.840
Oh, somebody show me the badge.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:55.020
So for people who worked on the Mars lander, they got a special badge.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.060
I don't know where it is.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:56.660
Oh, really?

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.340
Oh.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.560
I feel like there should be one of these as well.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.380
That would be cool.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.260
Right?

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.980
For the people that worked on this project.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.520
Yeah.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.640
There should be like a little black hole badge.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.560
So I don't have it.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.040
That would be very cool.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.060
But, you know, it's like a little badge, like here's the Arctic contributor one.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.460
There's a Mars rover one.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:15.360
So people in GitHub out there, let's make a black hole badge.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:20.280
Because there's so many of these open source projects that are indirectly used and contributors

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:20.720
to it.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.000
And they could have a black hole badge.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.840
And that would be awesome, I think.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.520
That's a great idea.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.800
I would be happy to reach out to people and try to see if I can make that happen.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.480
I think that would be really awesome.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:29.940
Yeah.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:30.320
Yeah.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:30.640
Indeed.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.700
I don't know.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.320
I think I don't know the username enough people to search for it.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.560
But anyway, I think that would be really cool.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.580
I think there should be a badge.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.660
But let's go and talk Matplotlib for a minute.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.840
So here you are presenting this keynote.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.160
Yeah, my favorite.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.260
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.920
Tell us about this picture that you got here.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:52.180
And then we can maybe dive into how you know the picture that we see is actually the picture.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.100
Yeah.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:57.840
This is my physics process, which is kind of underwhelming when you show it to most people.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:02.280
But people who are radio astronomers like me would be extremely excited seeing this.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:08.440
And this is really the first kind of depiction of M87 I saw after we finished the data processing

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:08.920
pipeline.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.500
This is before anyone made any image, by the way.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:17.640
It was in May 2018 when we actually finished the very first run of the full pipeline in

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.360
data calibration.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.440
And this was the end point, this plot.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:26.500
And what this plot shows is kind of on the y-axis, there's a flux density, which is basically

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.280
the brightness of signal seen by pairs of telescopes.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:34.640
And then on the x-axis, there is baseline length, which tells us kind of the separation between

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.600
pairs of telescopes.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.320
So telescopes close together see a lot of signal in common.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.940
Telescopes far apart see kind of smaller signal in common.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.300
And depending on their location, they probe different sections of the image.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.740
And so what we see here is this kind of, how would I say that, this kind of bump, double

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.100
bump in the image.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:57.060
And what this double bump actually tells us in the plot is if you look at the dashed line,

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:02.020
this is what we would expect if the image on the sky was a uniform ring.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:06.060
Uniform as in the brightness along the ring is the same everywhere.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.960
So it's just a closed ring and the brightness is the same everywhere.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:14.200
And so it turned out that this bump structure looked really close to a uniform ring.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:19.700
And this is already really exciting because we were already trying to imagine what does

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:23.460
the ring look like and how this plot also tells us how big it is.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:28.740
It tells us it was actually 42 microseconds wide, this ring, without any image.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:33.100
And what was also really cool is that if you look at the first dip location, you will see

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.420
that the data actually split into two levels.

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.560
There is a lower level and an upper level.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:42.800
And these correspond to two different directions on the sky that the stations are looking at.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:48.740
The lower level are looking at the source in the east-west direction, so across, and they're

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.000
seeing a kind of dip.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.400
And the other ones are looking at it in the north-south and they're seeing more signal.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:02.000
And what this difference tells us is that the ring is not uniform, but it's actually asymmetrical

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.020
in the north-south.

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:07.400
There's one part that is brighter, either north or south, that is brighter than the other

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:07.760
side.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:12.260
And if you look at our final image, it is brighter on the bottom than it is at the top.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.600
Whereas if you were to slice across, you will see it's the same, right?

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.320
If you were to slice across, it's the same.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:21.660
But if you were to slice like this, you have less signal up here and more signal down here.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.000
Already the plot told us so much about what we're looking at.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:25.300
Yeah.

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:29.660
So before we hit a picture, you're like, oh, we think we're onto something here, right?

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.160
Yes.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.560
It was super exciting.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.740
But then we were very careful because we thought, okay, there's a lot we can talk from this plot,

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:39.360
but let's not try to get ahead of ourselves.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:45.760
Because there are a lot of types of images that could be tweaked to mimic this kind of structure.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:52.400
And so that was kind of part of the next stages in which we wanted to split our teams into our big

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.540
imaging team into four independent teams.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:00.560
And each team works independently for about seven weeks on analyzing the data in any means they wanted,

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.200
with any software they wanted, any decision they wanted.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.180
And we came together after seven weeks at a workshop to compare the images.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.680
And each team submitted a single image.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:14.580
And it turns out that the images between the four teams were very, very similar to each other.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.200
And so that was really exciting.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.900
And everybody got a ring of the same size, 42 micrach seconds and brighter on the bottom.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:25.940
Even though there were kind of some small differences across the images that came from the user-based

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:30.400
choices in the software, the main structure was there for everyone.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:35.560
And I think that was one of my favorite days in the collaboration because we had so much fun that day.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:39.600
It was such a big relief because we were using so many different techniques,

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.000
kind of imaging software that we weren't sure we would all get the same answer.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.160
So we were really relieved that we did.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:51.240
And then, you know, at the end of the day, we all went drinking at a bar and turned out it was karaoke night.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.300
So we all sang karaoke together.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.260
It was such a lovely day.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:01.240
Were there any space-themed songs like Hello Major Tom or any of these things?

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.560
We sang Gua Tum San.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:03.980
Oh, there you go.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:04.200
Yeah.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.340
That was a must.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:07.540
Perfect.

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:08.360
Yeah.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.420
But we changed the lyrics to Blackpool Shadow.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:16.240
If you're taking petabytes of data and running them through a bunch of algorithms until they come down to megabytes,

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.580
or you said the final picture is actually like less than one meg.

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:19.780
Yeah.

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.240
Then, you know, what you're seeing, is that actually what you're seeing?

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.100
Or is that artifacts built up along the way, right?

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:30.280
So this must have been really comforting to try these different algorithms and go, they all come up with the same picture.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:30.620
Yeah.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:37.160
I think we were confident about what the data were telling us, but we wanted to make sure that we understood how our software were responding to the data.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:44.360
So, you know, from kind of objective perspective, when we looked at the data plots, we knew what it was telling us.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:50.800
But we wanted to make sure that we looked through every avenue of possible ways of creating images that look similar to the data.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:57.040
And in fact, it's really very hard to create images that don't look like what we have.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:04.840
And so no matter how much we tweaked our software, we would always end up with something very similar to the final image.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:10.520
But we still wanted to put our software through this test and do a kind of process in which we would test it.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:19.940
And in the end, the final stage ended up being trying to find what is the best kind of combinations of our software choices that gave us the best image.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:26.500
Because we generated so many images with user-based choices, and they ended up pretty similar to each other with the base structure.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.820
But how do you pick one image?

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.180
So that was kind of the dilemma we had at the final.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:33.160
We didn't know how to pick a single image.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:40.600
So we decided to create these kind of fake data sets that mimicked our data in which we knew the real truth images.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.240
And they looked like rings or disks or double sources.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:53.900
And then we made our softwares go through thousands of combinations of these parameters and kind of tested how well they could reproduce all four of them, all four images.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.160
And then the ones that were kind of, we ranked them.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.180
And then number one was the best image for each software.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:08.260
And then the final image, you know, the famous image of a black hole is actually just the average of the three software images, the three best images from the software.

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:11.680
And this is also only one image of the black hole.

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.200
This is only April 11.

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.040
We observed M87 for four days in 2017.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.660
So we have four images of this black hole from 2017.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.200
And they all look the same.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:28.360
And they all went through separate day observing, kind of separate processing, and always giving the same answer.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.780
So you all are pretty sure that this is the picture.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.440
Absolutely.

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.580
At least this is the radio astronomy picture.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.660
Yeah, this is the picture at 230 gigahertz.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:37.660
Yeah, exactly.

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:44.260
There's also pictures of that general space with Hubble and some other things that you laid out.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:52.080
Yes, this is a really fun part of our campaign also, because obviously we're trying, the purpose of our experiment is to learn about black holes.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.100
We want, I mean, these objects are super fascinating.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:49:00.040
They're kind of mind boggling in how they exist and what they do to galactic environments.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.520
These jets are enormous and they're pierced through entire galaxies.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.260
And yet they come from a very tiny part of the galaxy itself.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:12.640
And so in really understanding black holes, it's obviously really useful to look at one up close.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.880
But we need to combine that knowledge with how it looks across all colors, all wavelengths.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:25.960
And so we had a big multi-wavelength campaign at the same time as these observations across lots of different instruments.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:32.820
So we had instruments in the high energy, in the X-ray, infrared, in optical, and also other radio wavelengths.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:37.440
So we had a lot of partnerships with other observatories too, to make that happen.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:41.400
And we learned a great deal about the black hole and its jet through that process.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:41.720
Yeah.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:47.080
It seems that black holes, supermassive black holes are a fundamental part of galaxies almost, right?

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:47.640
Absolutely.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.200
They live in the centers of most galaxies.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.800
M87 is one of the special ones because it has this big jet coming out of it.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.840
So it's very nice to get a look at one that has a jet up close.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:04.980
And actually, our Milky Way black hole, Sagittarius A star, is one of the very common, boring ones.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:13.780
And so the fact that we can have both of them and look at both of them is kind of special because it gives us kind of two very different classes of black holes.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.960
That end up looking very much the same.

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.440
Sagittarius A star's image looks a lot like M87.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:24.740
This is really just because even though they're totally different black holes, they differ in mass by a factor of about 1500.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.700
And our Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, right?

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:32.660
But M87's galaxy is elliptical and it's much older and much bigger than our Milky Way.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:36.460
And M87 has a jet and Sagittarius A star doesn't seem to have one.

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.440
So there are two very different black holes.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:44.980
And yet, once you get up close, it's really just the effects of gravity is so strong that it's really all you see.

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.060
And it's so cool that they look the same.

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:47.900
Yeah, it is amazing.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:53.060
I guess it's worth just pointing out just how large the M87 black hole is.

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.040
Oh, yes.

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:59.340
The shadow of the M87 black hole could fit our entire solar system very easily.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:05.580
It could, you know, the orbit of Pluto would be about in the middle, in the kind of mid-range inside the shadow.

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:11.780
And Voyager 1, which is the furthest human-made object, would be just at the edge of the shadow right now.

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:12.760
Yeah, that's incredible.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.380
Very, very big.

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:15.580
If it were there, it would get sucked back in.

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.220
But if it were unaffected, it would be at the edge.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.840
Yeah, so also 6.5 billion solar masses.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:23.960
That's right.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:24.520
Yeah.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.320
That's really large.

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.620
That's a lot of mass.

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:29.540
It's actually one of the heaviest black holes in our universe.

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:37.100
I think the current heaviest is about 10, I think 10 billion solar masses, maybe a little more.

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:38.940
Wow, so that's not that much larger, yeah.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.360
Yeah, it was one of the pretty larger ones.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:41.900
Yeah.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.160
All right, well, we're getting a little short on time.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:51.200
So let me close this out with a bit of a future-looking question, and I'll give it to the IkuVu from the audience.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.080
So what's next for EHT?

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.300
I'll ask it that way.

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:55.560
Yeah.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.220
What now?

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:59.100
Since our 2017 campaign, we've kept observing.

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:08.220
We observed in 2018, where we added one telescope and increased our bandwidths, where we can have more sensitivity and cooler observations of magnetic fields.

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:14.940
We also observed in 2021, which was a kind of mid-COVID observation, which was a very strange one.

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:18.560
And in 2022, we added two new stations after that.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.060
So we're now up to 11 with the EHT.

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:24.360
And we're trying to expand our array to have more telescopes.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:29.360
So there's currently an effort called the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:43.580
So the EHT so far only borrowed telescopes that just happened to be at the right locations that were actually built for completely different science programs, just radio telescopes that were able to observe at the frequency we wanted and at the right place.

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:47.560
So we didn't have much of a control over the locations of the telescopes.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:53.300
And so in order to see more of our image, for example, to see the jet in MA-7, we need a lot more telescopes.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:57.880
So the Next Generation EHT plans to have more control over where telescopes are going to be put.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:03.040
So we're planning to get smaller dishes because we have the sensitivity now with the current EHT.

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:11.180
Smaller dishes at the locations where we need them, where we have holes in our virtual mirror to recover the structure.

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.480
And eventually, we'd like to observe more often.

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.500
So now we only observe two weeks a year.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:19.300
We want to be able to observe every two weeks or every month.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.520
And eventually, we could make movies of M-87.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:26.380
And also, if we have enough telescopes, we would be able to make movies of Sagittarius A-Star as well.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:32.780
And that will really show us the connection between the black holes, the gas swirling around it, and its jet and magnetic fields.

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.320
I think we could learn so much about black holes through that.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.660
It would be so exciting.

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:40.500
You could get precise speed of the accretion disk and how it evolves.

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.020
Yeah.

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:43.800
And that's about a 10-year time scale.

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:51.620
In the far future, in kind of 20 to 30 years, members of our team are currently actively thinking about putting satellites into space.

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:57.980
Since we're running out of Earth's diameter to make a bigger telescope, there's only two ways to make your telescope bigger.

00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:03.220
Either make the separation bigger or go to higher frequency so we have higher resolution.

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:07.980
And because of the Earth's atmosphere and the size of the Earth, we're limited in both.

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:14.060
But by going into space, we'd go above the atmosphere so you can go to higher frequency and you could have larger distances.

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:23.260
So by putting satellites into space, we could have enough resolution to maybe see up to 10 or even 50 more shadows of black holes, which would be really cool.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:31.560
And then we'd have amazing sharp images of the two that we know and love to really test theories of gravity, which would be terribly exciting.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:35.280
But of course, the technology to do that is not there yet, but it is moving forward.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.060
And it's something we're thinking actively about.

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:38.480
Getting there.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:44.940
Another thing you pointed out was all the results you got from this so far still back up the general theory of relativity, right?

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:45.680
That's right.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.000
Yeah.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.060
Einstein seems to be still correct.

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:52.420
Our black hole shadows are still very circular, which is what Einstein's theory predicts.

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.020
But we need much sharper images to see bigger differences.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:58.640
We were able to rule out some theories, but there are still some theories that survive.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:03.560
So we need to get to sharper and sharper images and a stronger and stronger test.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.960
But I think we're moving in that direction.

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:09.780
Our first image has really just opened this new laboratory of images of black holes.

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.740
So it's going to be an exciting new field.

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:13.900
Yeah, this is possible.

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:16.280
Now let's build on it, right?

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.160
Yeah, absolutely.

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:17.660
Awesome.

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:18.260
All right.

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:22.520
Well, I think we'll leave it there for the black holes, but congratulations to you.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:28.280
And I know that all the other people, often you point out that you're just the representative for this great big team.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:28.860
Yeah.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.240
I only play a small part.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:34.880
It's really a big team effort and a community effort, and everybody is part of it.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:35.400
Yeah, indeed.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.480
Now, before we get out of here, let me ask you the final two questions.

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.840
I always ask, if you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use these days?

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.480
What editor?

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:44.180
Oh, my God.

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:45.120
Super boring.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.180
I use de-edit.

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:46.860
Oh, perfect.

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:47.280
Awesome.

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.300
Yeah, very boring.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:53.740
If there's any Python package library you want to give a shout out to, maybe that was central to this work.

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:56.160
I know you already mentioned pandas and matplotlib.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.140
Anything else that was really useful here?

00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:08.040
Yeah, there was a really cool nested sampling algorithm that was developed by a Harvard grad student called Dynasty that was super useful for her modeling work and really kicked off a lot of that analysis.

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.720
So I'd like to shout that out, too.

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:10.660
And it's open source.

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:11.300
Yeah.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.220
I'll put a link to it in the show notes for people.

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:13.700
All right.

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:17.240
