00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.080
Wondering what Mastodon is all about?

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.340
More importantly, what does it offer Python developers and other open source folks compared to Twitter?

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.060
There's a huge amount of interest in the tech community about what's happening at Twitter

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.160
and about whether people should expand to or even entirely move to a new location.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.740
So I decided to put together a set of experienced Python developers

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.220
who have been Mastodon inhabitants for a long time

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.100
to discuss what this unexpected shift means for one of our most important online watering holes.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.920
On this episode, you'll meet Gina Houska, Simon Willison, Carol Welling, and Juan Luis Cano Rodriguez.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.860
We're going to have a great time talking about the technology and the culture of Mastodon from this Python perspective.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.500

Hello, Carol, Gina, Juan, Simon.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.400
Awesome to have you here.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.940
Hi there.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.300
Hello.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.820
Hi.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.600
Good to be here.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.400
Hey, Michael and everyone.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.320
Good to be here.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.340
I don't know if you all have heard, but there's a bit of a turmoil over at Twitter.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.880
And I think you could hardly hide under a rock and see that.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.500
Even the people who are living under a rock.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.880
Like, oh, yeah, I heard about the Twitter thing.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.660
Because every news channel is just like they bring on the expert that talks about interviews and various things that are going on.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:50.220
And I want to kind of start this episode just with a comment about Twitter real quick before we talk about maybe the alternative or destination or parallel universe.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.200
Twitter's been a really important community for me.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:03.700
And I don't want to, if I say anything negative about what's happening at Twitter, I don't want people who have been really great members of my community to feel like that's any way directed to them.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.420
It's been a really positive experience to be with so many people over there.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.520
And it's only with concern and worry that I would lose that community that maybe something might happen to Twitter.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.680
Either it gets wrecked and it's a place that people don't like or advertisers flee and it goes out of business or who knows what the future holds.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.040
But that's sort of what got me interested in alternatives.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.180
And Mastodon turned out to be a pretty interesting alternative.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.940
So maybe we could kick this off with just a really brief introduction and your perspective on that.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.460
Carol, we'll go down the video list here.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.060
Yeah.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.840
Hello, everybody.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.800
I'm Carol Willing.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.140
I'm a longtime contributor in the Python and Jupyter ecosystems.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.340
Right now, I'm a deep engineering at Notable, which is a SaaS-based notebook platform.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.120
Yeah, I've been a longtime user of Twitter and it's been great for community stuff, but I am concerned about the future.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.380
So I'm interested in hearing what everybody else has to say as well.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.820
Yeah.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.680
Well, welcome, Carol.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.980
Gina?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.640
Thank you.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.140
Hi, my name is Gina HÃ¤uske.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.220
I'm a full-time open source maintainer of my own project, Octoprint, now for almost 10 years.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:19.400
And I think my Twitter account was created in April 2009 and my Mastodon account was created in January 2020.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.520
So I've been a longtime Twitter user.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.160
It was my go-to social network after Google Plus went down.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.720
And I've met a lot of amazing people on there.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.860
And I really hate to see this community maybe go down now or something.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.440
I don't know.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.980
But in any case, that was also the reason why I jump chip quite early.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.620
And yeah, not jump chip, but just try to establish a new home, a new ground base,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.060
and gather my friends around me there again, so to speak.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.680
Gina, my feeling is sort of my terminology I'm trying to use right now is sort of Mastodon first,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.260
but not I'm deleting my Twitter account and I'm out of there.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.380
That's the way I'm thinking of it.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.100
Exactly.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.600
I'm absolutely not deleting it, but I'm now...

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.660
I switched the cross-poster direction and also the cross-poster...

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.760
Yeah, I switched it from opt-out to opt-in.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.700
Juan, hello.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.520
Hello, everyone.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.400
My name is Juan Luis.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.500
I'm from Spain.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.380
And since the past two years, I've been working as an advocate.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.400
So the social media aspect has been really important also for my work.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.360
Even though I've had a long-term love-hate relationship with Twitter in particular, right?

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.900
So I don't remember when I first signed up because I have removed my account and then signed up again at least two or three times.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:57.000
But I very vividly remember lots of political things happening and following elections and important stuff happening in not only my country, but everywhere in the world through Twitter and getting the news from there.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:06.400
So for me, it's been a very important part of who I am as a member of the society and as a person concerned about the problems of the world, of course.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.900
And I'm also very sad to see it go that way.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.320
I have a story of working in the space industry as well.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.280
So I know how the new boss of Twitter operates, perhaps better than other people.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.360
At the same time, I'm very hopeful for the future of not only Masterdom, but the whole Fediverse.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:40.980
Because in a way, it seems like the very first time that we're trying this idea for a massive audience, not just like seemingly small number of people very concerned with free and libre software and so on.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:55.420
But we are experimenting with how this looks like for many more users than we could imagine two weeks ago and probably much larger audiences than what we can moderate as well.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.840
Yeah.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.400
And two weeks from now, it's going to be crazy different than now as well.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.240
There's so much action that people are going to find out, I think.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.680
Yeah.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.860
So you're in an interesting situation where as your job as an advocate, dev advocate, you've got to be on social.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.860
You don't get to choose.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.480
And so you've got to go where people are and where the action is.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.200
Yeah.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.560
It's a whole conversation, like whether advocates should be on social media or if it's a requirement or not.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.440
But yeah, staying where the community is, is part of the job.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.860
Yeah.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.920
And you've also been on Mastodon.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.500
You're one of the old timers, the old guard, as they say over there.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.500
So that's excellent.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.000
Been like a year and a half.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.500
So I wouldn't consider myself old timer, but I've been concerned for about the Fed.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.800
Fediverse and alternative social media stuff for a very long time.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.240
Awesome.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.240
I can count how long I've been on the Fediverse on my fingers in days.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.580
So excellent.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.180
Simon, welcome.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.400
Sure.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.560
So hi, I'm Simon.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:59.680
I'm a full-time open source developer in Half Moon Bay, California, working on data set tools for data journalists and others to share and publish data.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.100
But I've been on Twitter for 16 years, it turns out.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.980
I signed up in November 2006.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.180
I'm user number 12,497.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.500
Because back then, Twitter had incremental IDs for their users, so I can tell you exactly where I was.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:22.480
And actually, I ran a startup built on top of the Twitter APIs for three years, which was then acquired by Eventbrite and moved us out to California.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.560
So Twitter is responsible for a major piece of my career at this point.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:37.920
And yeah, I had ignored the Fediverse entirely for five years because I understood the usability challenges around being decentralized and so forth.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.900
I'm like, you know what, Twitter works fine and it's a public company.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.820
What could go wrong?

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:50.160
It turns out what can go wrong is the world's richest man can buy the company in a fit of narcissistic whimsy and everything falls apart.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.900
So right now, I'm trying to find the alternative to Twitter, which cannot be bought by the world's richest man or bought by anyone else.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:05.180
And Master's on appears to be in exactly the right state and exactly the right point in its development for this crazy moment in time right now.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.740
I was staying there.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.120
Like I said, I have this sort of, I'm going to kind of be Mastodon first.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.560
I'm certainly not deleting my account.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.580
So staying is, I guess I'm still in a sense staying.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.720
But I was mostly focused there because my people were there.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:36.660
But as over the last week or so, what I've come to realize is, wow, Mastodon is way more in tune with open source, free software, unaffiliated tech organizations than any of the corporate big tech sites are in a very interesting way.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.360
Yeah. It's the growth of Mastodon in the past week has just been astonishing.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.600
Like it's hockey sticking and it's all people I like.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.980
I'm finding people on Mastodon who I didn't know who are great.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.360
I'm finding people on Twitter.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.360

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.360
I'm finding people on Mastodon.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.360
I've had a bunch of filmmakers and journalists.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.360
Screenwriters are showing up.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.360
Yes, it's amazing.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.360
It's really, really great.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.360
Let's see.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.360
Real quick question.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.360
This one goes to Juan first.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.360
David, an audience.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.360
So you weren't concerned with Twitter previously,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.360
only when Elon took over?

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.360
Or I guess it's more of a group question.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.360
Yeah, David said it was kind of directed to me,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.360
but I will others say their opinion.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.360
Yeah, kind of what Simon said already.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.360
I was also concerned about the idea of a whole entity,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.360
a whole media site being bought by a single person,

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.360
which might happen, I don't know, for Facebook,

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.360
it's already bought by a single person, right?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.360
In a sense.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.360
But it might happen to your favorite social network at any day.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.360
And the fact that now the Fediverse is gaining traction,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.360
it's distributed, puts some barriers to that.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.360
But apart from that, like Twitter has, in a sense,

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.360
been a victim of its own success in the sense that the algorithm,

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:42.360
the famous algorithm that puts more famous tweets up front

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.360
or things that you might engage with and so forth.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.360
In the end, it ends up favoring maybe things that make you angry

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.360
because the algorithm knows that you're going to engage with.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.360
Oh, they really respond well to this one here.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.360
Where the one about Nazis is so popular.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.360
Let's share that.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.360
Or Python versus Ruby.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.360
I don't know.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.360
Like all sorts of things making you angry.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.360
But, or maybe just silly memes that happen to be fun to watch,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.360
but I don't know, like making you lose some neurons.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:19.360
So I think like my quality of life improved a lot when I switched to the chronological timeline.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.360
So when I disabled the algorithm, but I had to put lots of measures like a browser extension

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.360
that hides the trending topics and blocking people like there's no tomorrow.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:36.360
I don't know, like I had to develop my own habits to make Twitter sustainable for me.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.360
And Elon Musk buying it was just the icing in the cake.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.360
So it pretty much went the same for me, I gotta say.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:50.360
So I started taking extended Twitter breaks, especially over the weekends when the pandemic started.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.360
And then even more so when the war started.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.360
And just because of all this negativity that got, that constantly got flooded into your timeline.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:05.360
And I already was on the chronological one and it still got flooded into there because obviously people who weren't in the,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.360
on the chronological one, got it, got it via the algorithm.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.360
Then they, I was about to say boosted it.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.360
Now they retweeted it.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.360
And that way then it ended up in mine.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.360
And I had to mute so many people.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.360
I had to add so many filters to my, to my experience and all of that.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:30.360
I mean, in the end I got a very filtered and very tame version of Twitter, but it was still way before that guy bought it.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:36.360
It was way before that already, just another sink of my energy actually.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:43.360
And, and with Mastodon, I never so far have had, I've been very active on there ever since the first, Hey, I'm going to buy Twitter thing.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.360
A broad, yeah, happened.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.360
I think April or so this year.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.360
And it was just like a completely, utterly different kind of experience.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:05.360
Like I met a number of people that I would never have found on Twitter who I now interact with a lot because they are just genuinely interesting and do very, very amazing stuff.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:11.360
And, there are capybaras and squirrels in my timeline way more than there were before on Twitter.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360
So I enjoy that stuff.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:20.360
And there is still the bad things and still the, the serious stuff and still the news, but they are tamed.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.360
They are not amplified to a thousand and that is really, there's not an algorithm boosting it even more.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.360
Yeah.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:32.360
This portion of talk Python is brought to you by the AWS insiders podcast.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:40.360
When was the last time you ordered a physical server to host your functions as a service, your latest API or your most recent web app?

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.360
I remember the last time I did that was around the year 2001.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.360
And yes, it was quite the odyssey.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.360
Of course we don't do that anymore.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:54.360
We run our code in the cloud with near instant provisioning and unparalleled data centers.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.360
And the most popular cloud provider is AWS.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:04.360
But for all the ways that AWS has made our lives easier, it has also opened a massive box of choices.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.360
Should you choose platform as a service, or maybe it's still VMs with IaaS.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.360
What about your database?

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.360
Maybe you should choose a managed service like RDS with Postgres or is DynamoDB better?

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.360
Maybe Aurora?

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.360
Maybe Aurora?

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.360
No, wait.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.360
I hear good things about Amazon DocumentDB too.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.360
And that's where the AWS insider podcast comes in.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:29.360
This podcast helps technology leaders stay ahead of Amazon's constant pace of change and innovation.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.360
Some relevant recent episodes include Storage Wars: Database Edition,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:41.360
Microservices or Macro Disaster, and Exploring Computer Vision at the Edge with AWS Panorama.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.360
They bring on guests to debate the options and the episodes are vibrant and fun.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:53.360
So if you want to have fun and make sense of AWS, head on over to talkpython.fm/awsinsiders.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:01.360
Yes, I know you probably already have a podcast player and you can just search for it there, but please use the link so that they know you came from us.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.360
Thank you to the AWS Insider podcast for keeping this podcast going strong.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.360
I'm going to say something controversial.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360
I love the algorithm.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:19.360
The thing I miss most from Twitter on Amazon is that I don't have the algorithm because the reason I love the algorithm is I realized that it gave me the freedom to follow a lot of people.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:32.360
I'm following four or 5,000 people on Twitter and the only way you can do that is you make sure you don't even pretend you're going to read everything and you trust that the algorithm will boost up a mixture of interesting things so that you can.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:39.360
And so whenever somebody says anything interesting at all on Twitter, I'll follow them and then I'll hope that future things they say that resonate will bubble up.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.360
And for the most part, that works really well for me.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.360
But it really it came down to the fact that I trusted the sort of core concept of Twitter, right?

00:16:47.360 --> 00:17:00.360
I trusted that there were enough people at Twitter who understood why it works and what's important about it that even while they play with NFT avatars and fleets or whatever they call them, all of that kind of stuff, the fundamentals were solid.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:09.360
And the reason I, the thing that made me lose faith was when Elon a week in fired half the company, like all of the people I know at Twitter who understood what Twitter was, they're gone.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:16.360
You know, he's, he's, he's completely, he's, he's, he's gutted that sort of institutional launch of what this thing is.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:25.360
And then his first big change that ludicrous selling verified checkmats rate dollars exhibited a complete failure to understand what this thing was and how this thing works.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.360
And at that point I lost all faith.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:32.360
I'm like, no, this, this thing I've trusted for 16 years to keep on working in a way that is useful.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.360
And that means that I can follow my 4,000 people in weird different spaces.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360
That's not going to hold.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.360
It's not going to work anymore.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.360
And, that was it.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:49.360
That was the point at which I switched my energies to mastermind and found that most of the stuff that I loved on Twitter was, was happening that in a much more pure, non-commercialized format.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.360
Like the commercial models are super worth, worth talking about.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:52.360
But yeah.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:57.360
So, so my, my biggest mastermind project when I plan is I want to build myself an algorithmic timeline.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.360
That's just for me.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:05.360
And it means that it essentially takes everything from people I'm following and randomizes them a bit and looks at things that I might not have seen recently.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.360
It just tries to give me a little bit of that magic back.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.360
I kind of like that a lot.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.360
You're going to open source that, right?

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.360
Oh yeah.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.360
I hope so.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.360
It's going to be a mess.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.360
SQL queries.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.360
It'll be lovely.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.360
Yeah.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.360
Yeah.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.360
I'm sure.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.360
I'll run on SQLite.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.360
It'll be amazing.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.360
Oh yeah.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.360
You know, I have to say I kind of took Simon's approach.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.360
I didn't use any tools when I was using Twitter.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.360
It was whatever came up in my feed.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.360
It was the news of the day.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:38.360
And what was great is, you know, I would see what Simon was up to and somebody else's cool bird pictures and whatever was going on in science.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:48.360
And, and so I had a very casual relationship with it, but it was something I looked at, you know, a couple of times a day and, you know, really learned a lot from.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:19:06.360
And so there was also the other side of Twitter, which is you get a community of people together where there's some anonymity and from like a core Python development standpoint and things where there was controversy, maybe within, you know, technical decisions that the language was making.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:14.360
Twitter could be a really yucky place, yuckier than mailing list and Slack and, and IRC.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.360
Does anybody still use that?

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:21.360
Probably, you know, but all of the other channels that we also follow.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:31.360
And I guess, you know, what I was seeing was more and more of my friends going to Mastodon and the people that I respect and like their opinions on.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.360
And I was like, you know, I've never been happy with the moderation side of Twitter.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.360
So let's see, let's see how this goes.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.360
But, you know, I'm like Michael, very new.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.360
I count on my two hands, like how many days I've been part of Mastodon.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.360
But so far I'm, I'm super, super happy with it.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.360
So.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.360
I'm as well.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360
And I was glad to see you show up over there.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.360
That was great.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.360
Cool.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:00.360
This whole conversation is going to be part sort of the culture of tech communities, but also part technical as well.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:11.360
And I think understanding how Mastodon fits well with open source and those types of communities has a bit to do with understanding how it's deployed, how it connects together, how it works.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.360
Who wants to talk about what the fediverse is and how do you create an account?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.360
Like, why are there so many weird different places I can go create an account?

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.360
Like what, what is this new world?

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.360
Why is it not mastodon.com?

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.360
And I just go in and create my account.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.360
And it's like the new Twitter.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.360
In a way, Mastodon is a bit like email, right?

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.360
Yes.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:33.360
Like, you have, you have a, you have an open, more or less well-defined protocol.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:39.360
That is actually a W3C standard called activity pub and activity streams.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.360
In email, we have SMTP and IMAP and stuff.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.360
And you have servers on the internet that speak that protocol.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:55.360
Those are mastodon.social, fosterdon.org, chaos.social, and anything that you want to set up on Masterhost and whatever.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:10.360
And the thing now is that just the same way that if you write an email from your Gmail account to someone who has their email hosted at Fastmail or on their own domain, you can also do that with Mastodon because you can write a toot.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.360
And we call these toots and not tweets to, to someone.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.360
So I can, I can toot to Mike.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.360
Mike is on fosterdon.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.360
I am on chaos.social.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.360
That works just fine because there is a common protocol shared that both servers speak.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.360
There is even in the activity pub spec, a concept of an inbox and an outbox.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.360
So it is very email-like in that regard.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.360
And that just works.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:42.360
And that doesn't just work for a micro blogging service like Twitter or in this case, Mastodon, because when we talk about Mastodon, we also have to talk about the fatty wars.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.360
And Mastodon is just a part of the fatty wars because there is other stuff.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.360
There is an Instagram alternative called Pixel Fed.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:22:02.360
Same thing, open source software you can install on your server and then put your pictures on there and share them across to other Pixel Fed or even to other Mastodon instances because it's the same protocol.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:11.360
There is stuff like a YouTube alternative called PeerTube.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.360
Same protocol, again, cross-compatible, can talk to each other.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.360
We have Bookworm that is a bit like Goodreads.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.360
By the way, Witten and Python.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:21.360
Very interesting to look into the source if you want to get an idea how to implement activity pub.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.360
And yeah, there's a ton of other stuff too.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.360
So currently Mastodon is very big in focus because of this Twitter alternative thing.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:43.360
But when you start looking into this whole fatty wars and this whole thing that powers Mastodon and how Mastodon works, then you realize, hey, there is a big, big world there beyond just sending toots and talking about squirrels.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:55.360
And it's crazy how these different alternatives can communicate together because have you seen when people share a tweet that contains a screenshot of an Instagram post that it's itself like a screenshot of something they saw on TikTok?

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:02.360
So it turns out that you can communicate through all these alternatives with the same protocol.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:10.360
It feels surreal that you can, from Twitter, so to speak, follow an Instagram account and get their pictures on Twitter.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.360
It's like nothing we've ever dreamed of.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.360
And it's currently possible with the technology.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.360
Of course, it has like quirks and whatnot.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:29.360
But in a sense, it's like prohibiting world gardens for good and just interacting with any sort of social media with a unified protocol.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.360
Yeah, there's nobody who controls whether you have a blog or not on the internet.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.360
Not really.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.360
I want to try to say exactly.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.360
Mastodon here where I think the fact that this works as well as it does is a miracle.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.360
It is absolutely phenomenal.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.360
Like people have put, Mastodon itself is six years old.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.360
The activity pub standards are even older than that.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:53.360
A huge number of incredibly hardworking, incredibly smart people have sweated over this stuff for years and years and years.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.360
And I feel like that we're getting one of those overnight success moments right now where overnight successes are always like five years in the making.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:05.360
You know that two weeks ago, we all started leaping onto this thing and it hasn't sunk.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:13.360
Like the fact that it's actually managing to scale up with this amount of activity with a few glitches and some things are a little bit slow occasionally.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.360
No, I think this is an absolute miracle of software engineering.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.360
I could not be more impressed by what these people have built for us.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.360
This thing that we're diving on right now.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:28.360
It's just, it's just, but this is an incredibly difficult technical problem, incredibly difficult social problem.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:35.360
The design problem, like designing community software is extremely hard and they've put, they've done such a great job of this.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.360
And so you see people sort of complaining about little details and things and they say, no, come on.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:48.360
Like we, we all just got here and I cannot believe what an amazingly rich and vibrant world they have created and something that technically works so well.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.360
And I'm just astonished by it.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.360
Yeah.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.360
I love that perspective.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.360
And I totally agree with you.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:25:00.360
It should also maybe be added that some of the things that people complain about missing are actually intentional stuff, intentionally left out.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.360
So for example, a lot of people come on Mastodon for the first time.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.360
And the first thing that they miss is where's the quote feature.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.360
Why can I not quote this, this truth and, and set my, my opinion on top.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.360
And that is intentional because the idea is that on Mastodon, you should not talk about people.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.360
You should talk with people.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.360
So comment on that thing, interact with the thing.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.360
You are free to just boost.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.360
So retweet your, your, your, your response.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.360
So that's, that it gets more, more widespread visibility maybe.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:41.360
But the first thing that you should do is interact with the person who wrote something that you want to discuss or want to add to instead of just trying to be like, Hey, look what I found.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.360
And all of this is now about me.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.360
And the other thing is that people miss a search.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.360
And I can totally understand that because the only thing that you can currently search is your local instance and maybe the federated timeline.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:26:04.360
And that is also intentional because the idea is that if you are on Twitter and you are a very, very bad person who wants to target a marginalized group, then you enter some keywords and you add those keywords as a safe search.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:12.360
And then you constantly and constantly and constantly just abuse the people who pop up with this keyword search.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.360
And you cannot do that on Mastodon.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.360
It's simply, that is not possible.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:21.360
It goes a long way to humanizing and rehumanizing the tools that we work with.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:35.360
Because it does give you this sense of, hey, I'm not going to be as targeted for something I say or do that is just part of my normal open source everyday world.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:51.360
But like Simon said, I mean, I think, you know, you've got these brilliant people coming together out in the open to manage a service that I have much more questions whether or not Twitter is going to fall over in the next month than I do next month.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:27:11.360
I mean, just, you know, and I guess some of that's the experience that I had with, you know, the federated version of my binder dot org and how we went from a small group of people, you know, hosting notebooks for free for the academic world and, you know, federated it out to other institutions to handle the capacity.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.360
And it's worked out really well over the last few years.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:22.360
So, you know, I give a lot of credit to the folks that have been working hard for the last several years on Mastodon.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:29.360
I feel like we should talk about the business model because Twitter, it's ads and selling your data and all sorts of stuff.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.360
The thing I love about one of the things I love about Mastodon, the business model is just so open.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.360
It's like there are volunteers who are doing this stuff.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.360
They are volunteers.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.360
They are spending their time moderating.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.360
They're spending their money running instances.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.360
You should support them.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.360
Obviously, you should, right?

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.360
There's no ad.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.360
You can't use the thing for free and expect it to be paid for because then there are ads.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360
There are no ads or anything.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.360
And I feel like Elon has set us the price, right?

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.360
The price is $8 a month, right?

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.360
That's what he wants us to pay on Twitter.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:02.360
If everyone who's using Mastodon and can afford to do so puts an $8 a month towards their local server they're running on, it's going to be fine.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.360
It's just going to work.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.360
And we should all be committed to doing that, I think.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.360
I absolutely do.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:14.360
Let's talk about the instances because I think the cultural aspect of the norms, especially that Carol was talking about, are really important here.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.360
And that also has a bit to do with the deployment.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.360
Now let me track down.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.360
There's an interesting place to begin finding an instance.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.360
There's how many instances are there now?

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.360
4,000?

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.360
Something like that.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:32.360
These are basically hosts for little communities, little islands of Mastodon.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.360
And there's this place called instances.social.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.360
And you can say, well, I want to, what language do I want to speak?

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.360
Do I care how many people are there?

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.360
Because you might want a small community or a large.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:46.360
And you can say about what you, you know, the type of content that you would like to be blocked.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.360
And then you could go search.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.360
I'm interested in open source.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.360
And what do you get?

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.360
You get all these different, you know, Faucet on, for example, NixNet and so on.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.360
The one that I think is pretty interesting that I just recently learned about is Hackerdom.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.360
You know, Carol, I know that you're on there, right?

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.360
Absolutely.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:13.360
And they have a great, you know, Nova, very seasoned open source contributor who's done tons of work in Kubernetes and other communities.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.360
And they have a really open model.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.360
It's on GitHub.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.360
You know exactly what they're doing in terms of the community standards.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:29.360
And, you know, I started seeing friends of mine go there and I was like, hey, they're doing it right from the start.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.360
And I think that's something that to me is really important.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:39.360
Like, hey, I know this is going to be about as safe an open space that one can get.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:45.360
Easy to know how to contribute back to them financially, in code, whatever.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.360
And, you know, you know what the rules are and the direction is.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.360
And, you know, I couldn't be more happy to be part of that.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.360
My favorite thing about this server, you can see it on Twitch.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:01.360
So Chris Nova streams on Twitch and in the background is a rack lit up.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.360
And that rack is Hackyderm.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.360
Hackyderm sits in the basement.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.360
It's got a fiber optic cable plug coming into it.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.360
It's a real thing, right?

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.360
It's really exciting.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.360
You can touch it.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.360
Yeah.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360
It's not in the cloud.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360
It's in the ground, actually.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.360
It's in the basement.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:25.360
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.360
Starting a business is hard.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.360
By some estimates, over 90% of startups will go out of business in just their first year.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:41.360
With that in mind, Microsoft for Startups set out to understand what startups need to be successful and to create a digital platform to help them overcome those challenges.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.360
Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub was born.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:51.360
Founders Hub provides all founders at any stage with free resources to solve their startup challenges.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:31:00.360
The platform provides technology benefits, access to expert guidance and skilled resources, mentorship and networking connections, and much more.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:09.360
Unlike others in the industry, Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub doesn't require startups to be investor backed or third party validated to participate.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.360
Founders Hub is truly open to all.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.360
So what do you get if you join them?

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:21.360
You speed up your development with free access to GitHub and Microsoft cloud computing resources and the ability to unlock more credits over time.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:31.360
To help your startup innovate, Founders Hub is partnering with innovative companies like OpenAI, a global leader in AI research and development, to provide exclusive benefits and discounts.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.360
Through Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub, becoming a founder is no longer about who you know.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:50.360
You'll have access to their mentorship network, giving you a pool of hundreds of mentors across a range of disciplines and areas like idea validation, fundraising, management and coaching, sales and marketing, as well as specific technical stress points.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:55.360
You'll be able to book a one on one meeting with the mentors, many of whom are former founders themselves.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.360
Make your idea a reality today with a critical support you'll get from Founders Hub.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:06.360
To join the program, just visit talkpython.fm/foundershub, all one word, the links in your show notes.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.360
Thank you to Microsoft for supporting the show.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.360
Yeah.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:18.360
So when you come to these different instances, you can use instance.social to search and then they each have, you know, this one, there's 6000 active participants.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.360
However many users and it has a mission statement.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:26.360
And that matters because they can control who can be on that instance.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.360
If you don't like it, go somewhere else.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.360
When you have conversations, there's a way to say, I want to see the conversations instead of happening on all of Mastodon.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.360
I just want it on the people who belong on this small group, no matter how many others there are.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.360
I think it's really neat.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.360
It's tricky, though.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:47.360
Like this is, I think the biggest barrier to joining Mastodon is that on the moment you join, you have to make that decision.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:52.360
And it's a really difficult decision to make if you don't know your way around, you know.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.360
And it's like, I couldn't make the decision.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.360
I ended up running my own instance.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.360
I'm paying a company for me because I didn't want to have to choose.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.360
I'm like, no, I'm interested in everything.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.360
And I want to align myself with the free software people or these people.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.360
I'm paralyzed by indecision.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.360
So, yeah.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.360
So I ended up running my own server.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.360
It's cool that you can do that.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:18.360
But it is, I feel like when you're trying to encourage people to Mastodon, it is, this is the thing people need the most help with is this particular process.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:24.360
Because you're going in with no idea what makes a good server, but you have to pick before you can even start engaging with it.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.360
Yeah, it is tricky.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.360
Harley out in the audience says, could someone invite me to the one where the Python peeps are on?

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:37.360
Yeah, it's not, I'm not so sure you can get an invite, but you know, Fosstodon, the free and open source software, hackerdom.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.360
I think there's five of us in this call and we have five different servers, right?

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.360
Or almost.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360
Perfect.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.360
Yes, I think.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360
Yeah, that's right.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.360
We are.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.360
Yeah.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.360
I think we're all on five different servers.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.360
But we still talked and organized this through Mastodon, right?

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360
Exactly.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.360
Exactly.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.360
That's a huge proof that the system works.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:34:00.360
I, in fact, I started on Fosstodon because it was, I don't know, more aligned with my interests at the time.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:06.360
But Fosstodon has a moderation policy at the moment that they don't allow non-English posts.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.360
And sometimes I just want to toot in Spanish.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.360
And so, yeah, I went on and created my own instance.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.360
And now I'm like spreading my content everywhere in any language I like.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.360
But I think the moderation challenge is quite interesting.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:28.360
And I'm looking forward to someone to set up like a graph of people in a sense like, okay, you can invite someone.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.360
But if that someone does something nasty, then I'm going to ban them.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.360
And I'm going to ban you as a result.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.360
Gotcha.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.360
And those things.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:40.360
Someone to keep track of the social structure of the network so that there's mutual accountability.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.360
I think that would be a super interesting watch.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.360
Yeah.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.360
And these instances can ban other instances.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:57.360
Like, for example, I haven't looked at Hackadom, but I know that Fosstodon is banning certain other instances for various reasons, because it's spam or there's people who've done things that are unwelcome.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.360
So it's not just one person is banned, but like this whole community.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.360
We just don't want them to be part of it.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.360
Yeah.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.360
I'm not sure if that says, it doesn't say there.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.360
Yeah.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.360
This one found racism and questionable other badness.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.360
Violation, violation, racism.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.360
One of these I saw just said Nazis.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.360
Like, okay, that's clear.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.360
Like, okay, that's clear.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.360
Obviously.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.360
We don't want that.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.360
And then limited.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:17.360
Yeah.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.360
So I think this is really important, right?

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.360
Like this is, this goes to choosing your home base, right?

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.360
Because it's more than just what hosts your content.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.360
It hosts your norms and morals and stuff.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.360
Yeah.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:34.360
I think there's, it should be made easier for people to migrate to other instances because

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.360
at the moment, for some technical reason, I don't know, you cannot migrate your posts.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.360
You can only like migrate your followers and stuff.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.360
So if people can just move around freely, it's not that much of a big issue.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.360
There's some nice articles about choosing your own instance.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.360
There's that, that app, I guess.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.360
One of the thing where we're kind of on the culture side, Simon, you talked about the value

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.360
of the algorithm.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:01.360
And I agree with that, you know, acknowledging the filter bubble aspects of algorithms.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:07.360
There is some real value when you post messages here, because there's no algorithm, it becomes

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.360
like tailing a log of a super busy website, just stuff screaming by.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.360
And it becomes really hard to just interact in the general stream of information.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.360
Masadon has ways to say like you reply, but it's not really a public reply.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.360
It's sort of a semi, people can discover it, but it's not announced.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.360
And I asked people, what is the right way in which to, you know, what's the default way

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.360
to reply to somebody?

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.360
And most people said, I'll just hit reply in public.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:35.360
And to me, that seems, that seems like it's going to kind of overwhelm the system.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.360
If every conversation.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.360
I believe replies in public will only get delivered to people who follow both you and the person

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.360
you're replying to though.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.360
I think that's how that works.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.360
Okay.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.360
So I don't know.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.360
Am I wrong about that?

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:53.360
I think public goes into the public outbox of the, of the local timeline as a local server

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.360
as well.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.360
And so it also ends up on federated servers.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:04.360
So, the general recommendation is for example, for bot accounts to, to always set them to, to

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.360
unlisted.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:12.360
So they don't spam timelines, but can still be found, naturally, through hashtag

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:16.360
searches, for example, which by the way, I think contrary to, to full text searches

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:22.360
unlisted is the thing where, it still pops up in your followers timelines automatically, but

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.360
it doesn't pop up in the public timeline on your instance on the local one.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.360
So maybe we should say we have a local one, which is just the stuff on your server.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.360
And then we have the federated timeline, which is the stuff on your server plus anything and

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.360
anyone that interacts with people on your server.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:45.360
So that is a bit complicated and I have not fully understood yet what exactly goes in there, but,

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.360
right.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.360
That is the, that is the two things.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:53.360
I thought federated was anyone who's followed by at least one of the users on your server, but it's

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.360
not because on my personal server, that's just me stuff shows up in federated.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.360
That's not from people I'm following.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.360
There's no one else in my service.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.360
So yeah, it's, it's complicated.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:09.360
I think if you follow me and I boost someone else or, or, or like a post from someone else,

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.360
that is maybe a better example.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.360
If I'm like, if you interact with it in any way, yeah.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.360
I interact with that.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.360
And that also means it will show up on your server, even though you are only following me.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360
Okay.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.360
Okay.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.360
I think it was like, I read into the activity spec, but yeah.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.360
The fact that we need to analyze it so much and we still don't fully understand it.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.360
For me, it's a UX problem.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:35.360
I don't know if it can solve it, if it can be solved by the technology, but no doubt it's

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:41.360
a problem and no amount of per stack fairy tips is going to, fix a UX problem.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.360
Like there, there has to be someone working on it.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.360
I think sensible defaults would be nice.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.360
Yeah.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.360
I set my default visibility to unlist it and I have to opt into public on my world.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.360
So, speaking of changes that might be coming in a UX thing.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.360
So I did want to point to that Mastodon itself is open source.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.360
Obviously Juan and Simon running your own.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.360
You're probably deeply familiar with this code over here.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:08.360
And they're, they just announced that they are about to release version 4.0.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.360
I, I don't know what great features that's going to include, but hopefully some of these

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.360
things get a little bit ironed out as well.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.360
I don't know if you'll have any visibility into that.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.360
so it's a, it's a very active open source project.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.360
You can see it's got 2.6,000 issues.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.360
There's a lot of, and it's, it, it's been well-made.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.360
It's got people working on it full time or at least one person working on it full time,

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.360
which, and again, they'd be amount of, the amount of impact they're having from a

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:38.360
very tiny sort of team of contributors is, is truly extraordinary, but it does seem to be

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.360
something where you can get like very actively involved with it.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.360
there are also lots of interesting alternative versions out there.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.360
Andrew Godwin is spent last two days,

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:53.360
picking together his own custom Mastodon on Django thing, which I'm really excited about

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.360
because, his signature feature is going to be, that it'll be easier to point custom

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.360
domains to it.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.360
Right now you have to run a separate Mastodon for every custom domain that you want,

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.360
which is very inefficient.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.360
This way you'll be able to run one of Andrew's things and have your, your, all of your friends

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.360
with their own custom domains can still share the same instance.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:15.360
but yeah, the, I also get, get a feeling from looking at it that there are inefficiencies

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.360
in the way that it works, which are basically because it hasn't needed to scale that much before

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:26.360
now, you know, the way it distributes posts using sidekick queues and Ruby requests worked fine.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:31.360
Two weeks ago, suddenly that's beginning to strain at the edges, but it means that if you want to help

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.360
make this stuff more efficient, there are, this is a great time to be getting involved in helping fix

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.360
some of the UI things and improve some performance.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.360
And there's, there's just so much work to be done and so many available people to help do that.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.360
So I'm expecting some very healthy activity around all of these different open source projects

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.360
to be coming up pretty soon.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:54.360
I was going to say, because we're pulling in a bunch of different groups of people, I think the likelihood

00:40:54.360 --> 00:41:01.360
of getting more folks that are really into user experience and UI and, and, you know, how to run

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.360
asynchronously things, you know, more efficiently.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:11.360
You wind up with these expertise coming into the ecosystem, which I think is, is going, going to continue

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.360
to kind of energize it.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.360
At least that's my hope.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.360
Well, we've got really good bones to build on.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:21.360
Like all of the decisions made so far are very, like it's a very high quality product.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.360
It's a very high quality code base.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.360
It's not like it needs fixing.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.360
No, not at all.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:30.360
It will definitely benefit from, from more people able to help it take on these newer challenges that are emerging

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.360
just as the entire world leads on it in one go.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.360
Yeah.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:39.360
And I think it's sort of that you plug in user experience kind of side of things where you're going to see the real growth.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:46.360
And about the new things in Maslow 4.0, actually, if you go to the release notes of 4.0 release candidate one,

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.360
you can see that there's lots of new features that got added things to some funds from the European commission.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:42:00.360
And then they're working on things like being able to translate posts or having like more granular control on roles inside servers

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:06.360
so that bigger instances can have any moderation roles that they want.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:12.360
And I don't know, like there's lots of exciting stuff coming for Maslow in particular.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:18.360
And I'm sure like it's going to affect the whole Fediverse as a whole.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.360
A lot of new technologies being brought in here.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.360
Like, no, this little, this little scheduled background worker thing.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.360
We should maybe choose a different technology to make it go fast.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.360
Simon, you mentioned Andrew Godwin's.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.360
Takahe, I think. Yeah.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.360
In which language is this, this word written?

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.360
Is there any explanation of that? I'm curious.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:39.360
I don't. I was, I was guessing Hawaii, but I don't know.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.360
It seems like that to me too, but I don't know either actually. Yeah.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:50.360
I don't know. I mean, to me, the bird evokes like fanning out their wings and what, you know, the distributed nature where he talks about.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.360
It's a New Zealand bird. It's the sapo.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.360
New Zealand.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:53.360
Yeah.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.360
New Zealand.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.360
Lightless hen.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.360
Lightless hen.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.360
Yes. I love New Zealand flightless birds.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.360
Generally. I might have to call mine.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.360
I do.

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.360
I do a mastermind implementation just to keep Andrew's name convention going.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.360
But yeah, I'm developing this entirely in the open.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.360
I I'm finding this useful because I may have plans to do build my own code around this.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:19.360
I'm going to steal his implementation of like the site, the H to be signing and all of the difficult bits that he's figuring out.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.360
That's it's it's it's this, this looks very exciting.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.360
Sure does.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.360
The signing is actually fairly, fairly simple.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.360
The problem is how do you address anything that you're supposed to send out?

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:37.360
Oh, I yeah, I have a little pet project brewing now since the start of this year or rather like the end of the last one.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.360
And that is activity park focus.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:43.360
So I was also working on that stuff a bit in the background.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:48.360
And it is a lot to take in, but it is fairly clever.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.360
All in all.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.360
The, if you want to see how the stuff works.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.360
So I'm, I'm running my own instance.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.360
I'm playing masto dot host to do all of the work, which is great.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.360
Like I don't have to figure out the Docker containers and so forth.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.360
But, when you have an instance of your own, you get access to the admin panel.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:09.360
And one of the things in there is the sidekick queue and view, which shows you what's been queued up to go out.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:16.360
And it turns out anytime you send a toot, it needs to be sent to every server that at least one of your followers is on.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.360
I've got like 5,000 followers who have spread across 580 servers.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:29.360
So if I toot that's 580 deliveries that need to be made, which is on the one hand, that sounds like a pretty giant and intimidating amount of traffic.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:38.360
and if you watch, if I, if I get into a conversation and send a bunch of toots, my queue can grow to like 10,000 items and take like 20 or 30 minutes for it to fully drain through.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.360
but I started thinking about it and thinking, you know what?

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:45.360
If I load a webpage and open up the network pane, it makes a hundred requests, right?

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.360
Pages are pretty inefficient these days.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:53.360
So actually sending 600 requests because I tooted by modern web standards, that's not really an enormous amount of traffic.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:45:07.360
And this is where I feel like there's some low hanging fruit here, just in terms of more efficient sending of these, of these, of these, requests that, but this is where Andrew built using Python asyncio, which feels to me like the right kind of technology to apply here.

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.360
Yeah.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:12.360
But yeah, it's, it's, it's really interesting just having those little insights into, into what's going on under the hood.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.360
And there is, this is not, it's a lot more complicated than running a blog.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.360
You know, if you're hosting your own blog, there aren't that many moving parts.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:25.360
If you're hosting a master's on server or an activity server, there is a lot more activity that has to go on under the hood for all of this work.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:30.360
What on GitHub, right here on GitHub, it's a 66 requests to pull up a, a read me.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.360
So that we got, so, so something like that, right?

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:39.360
One thing I want to talk about, if we go over to the various profiles and I'll pull up mine for just a sec.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:47.360
One of the things I guess, one of the things that's a little bit annoying here is if you search for yourself, you're going to find multiple ones of you.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.360
Look, there's three of me.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:53.360
And if I look for like jet brains there, there are many, none of these are real accounts.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.360
They're all, all fake.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.360
Right.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.360
And yet there's many Twitter barrels actually.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.360
Yeah, exactly.

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.360
Yeah.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.360
If I search for Carol, oh, there's only one Carol.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.360
Amazing.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360
So good.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.360
Yeah.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.360
Thanks for that.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.360
Thanks.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.360
No, it's great.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.360
I mean, look, there's four Simons.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:22.360
And, and so the reason I bring this up is you have to do a little bit of work, not to pay $8 to get a red, a blue verified sticker, but to establish your presence and show that you're a real person.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:27.360
So for example, on my profile, I have one well-known domain that's verified.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.360
And then it links over to like talk Python and Python bytes.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:40.360
And those are both, if I were to go to them, they also have, you know, verified by verified, not paying money, but go through the protocol or the conventions and talk about that.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.360
Like talk about this, this sort of creating a verified account here.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.360
So I think it's a very smart technique.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:49.360
It's very similar to how you verify a site on Google search.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:55.360
For example, you say, okay, so let's configure some DNS with a special record that only you know.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.360
And then when you do that, then Google knows that the site belongs to you.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.360
Right.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:11.360
And the way you go and do that here is that you go to these URLs that you control, and then you add a backlink pointing to your masterstone profile.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:18.360
And somehow the system does this update for you and those links appear as verified.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:24.360
And I think it's really interesting first that you don't need any technical special thing.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.360
You don't need any blockchain or anything like that for it to work.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:37.360
Like as long as you trust that talkpython.fm is by Michael Kennedy, then you can assume that the Postadon account is going to be properly verified.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:47.360
And at the same time, it sets a very good precedent for news outlets, for example, to create their own instance and say, look, we're going to verify our instance.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:55.360
And you know that anybody with an account here is either like a journalist of ours or it's us, our official voice and so forth.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:00.360
So it provides a way of doing this distributed, inexpensive verification.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.360
And I think that's really, really interesting.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:08.360
And there's no central authority that says, we hereby confer upon you this check mark, right?

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:14.360
It's here's the evidence I present that I am me or that talkpython is talkpython or whatever.

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.360
And that gets verified and people can decide how much they trust that.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.360
I just love this because it's such an elegant solution.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:26.360
And it's so funny with Twitter verification being this complete trash fire for the past two weeks.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.360
And it was bad.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.360
And now it's really bad.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.360
Yeah, right.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:34.360
And then on Mastodon, it's like, oh, no, you put a rel equals me link on your site back and you highlight the plane and that's done.

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.360
And I think it's beautiful.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.360
I mean, it's a really clever.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.360
So there are some interesting tricks with it.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:48.360
So like I've got a GitHub account and GitHub will use rel equals me only on the about URL field on your profile.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.360
So and you only get one of those.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.360
So you can link back to your account from GitHub and get a verified thing.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.360
But then I wanted that to point at my regular site.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:02.360
So I edited it back again, which actually breaks because my server knows that I'm verified because it happened to check while that link was there.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:07.360
But then other people's servers don't show that verification because they all check independently as they should.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.360
Right. Nobody should trust my server about the verified links.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.360
They all need to do their own little verification step.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:22.360
Also, when you look at the activity queues, there's a whole lot of activity efforts just checking these verified links from each server to make sure that they're back.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:26.360
But I do think it's a beautifully simple and elegant way of solving this problem.

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:29.360
And then of course, you can add like a blue check bar next to your name.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.360
Just to do the joke, right?

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.360
Nobody prevents you from doing that.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.360
I actually did that.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.360
I'm very proud of it.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.360
There's a ton of people who have colon verified.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.360
I don't know if I could pull it up.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.360
But yeah, they're like this.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.360
Oh, yeah.

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:45.360
That's server specific though.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.360
Oh, is that right?

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.360
Emojis.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.360
Yeah.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.360
I think that doesn't work on mine.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.360
Or at least I haven't seen it on accounts online yet.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.360
But it's okay.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.360
Axe Wax out there says you can put it in the location field and get up as well.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.360
Do you have an example of that?

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.360
That'd be great to see what you're talking about.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.360
I can pull up.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.360
I don't think you can put URLs in the YouTube chat.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.360
They will be filtered out.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.360
Yes, you're right.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.360
Of course, they will be filtered out.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.360
I was probably the geographical location field.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.360
Maybe on your user location field and GitHub, maybe.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:19.360
I just hope that GitHub will see the light about the importance of Mastodon verification

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:29.360
and allow us to either add a Mastodon account there or just, you know, like more than one homepage link with an well equals me thing there.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.360
And I've poked them a bit, but so far, sadly nothing.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.360
But I'll keep poking them.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.360
There's an open issue about that or a conversation somewhere, right?

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:40.360
I saw that the other day, but I don't, I didn't collect the URL.

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.360
So.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.360
Yeah, I pinged them on the internal Slack.

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.360
And Axe Wax said, yes, the location field.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:51.360
There's a couple other things I want to follow up on here before we go.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.360
And Gina, this one might be particularly relevant to you.

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.360
Here, let me put this in.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:02.360
So apparently the German government has set up its own Mastodon server.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.360
You probably know more than I do about this.

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:10.360
Yeah, they created this social.bund.de and yeah, more and more ministries and official places.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:20.360
So what you see there in the screenshots is the, or was the, so the BME Bund, which is, which is our ministry of, of inner security and such.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:30.360
And then yeah, data protection, freedom of information, my own county, as I just said also, or rather my own state actually also is apparently now there.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.360
The Hessische Landtag.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.360
So, hey, cool.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:36.360
And yeah, they, they started doing that around the time that Elon bought the thing.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.360
So two weeks ago or three weeks, I don't know.

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:45.360
Maybe the server is older, but the influx of a ton of official accounts started.

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.360
Yeah.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.360
Something around that time.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:57.360
And what I also recently learned is, so we have this international emergency broadcast thing that is not SMS based, but rather an app.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:18.360
I don't know how official that is, but there is also a server dedicated to just subscribing to the so-called NINA notifications for your location so that you get a mastodon notification when there is some kind of emergency, like, like really bad weather, or I don't know, some, some, some, some bomb that was found from World War Two again, which also happens all the time here.

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.360
And that is kind of neat that they integrated that.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.360
So I immediately followed my local one.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:29.360
It's a little terrifying though, because that means make matters on a safety critical system.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:35.360
You know, when my queue is backed up for an hour, suddenly I'm getting nervous that these messages really do need to be delivered in real time.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.360
As you're looking at the rubble warning earthquake coming.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.360
True.

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.360
Oh, wait.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.360
Yeah.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.360
But no, this is, this is really, really cool.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.360
I absolutely love this idea.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:48.360
And I think other governments should, should also consider this seriously.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.360
Now, two more areas.

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.360
We're getting short on time.

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.360
I want to make sure we focus on first, a little bit of programmability.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:59.360
There's a thing called toot and a Python library, which you can program called toot.

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:03.360
So toot, the toot CLI, is that what it's called?

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.360
Yep.

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.360
And it's a mastodon in the terminal, right?

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.360
Which is pretty interesting.

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.360
But it has a Python library.

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.360
Has anyone done anything with this?

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.360
Not yet.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.360
No.

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:18.360
I've been playing with the API directly because mastodon, your local, your server has an API.

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:23.360
It's super, super, it's a very clean, very well designed API.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.360
One of the things it can do is it's got a streaming API.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.360
So you can hold open a connection to a URL.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:32.360
And every time a new toot comes in, it gets fed to your script.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:42.360
I've got a, I wrote, I have a little script in the gist, which I've just pinged to you in the private chat, which listens to my server and writes to a SQLite database every time something happens.

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.360
And then I can analyze it in data set and run SQL queries.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.360
And so I put, this is going to be the basis.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.360
And you scroll down.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:50.360
So you went python stream.py and give it a database.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.360
That's the schema.

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.360
And this is the whole thing.

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.360
It's what, like 30 lines of code.

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:59.360
Because all you have to do is stream against that feddy.signwinson's and that API v1 stream in public.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:03.360
And then every time a new line comes in, treat it as JSON and writes the database.

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:07.360
So when I talk about building my own algorithm, this is how I'm going to do it.

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.360
I'm going to be sucking all of that data down into a little SQLite database and then running SQL queries against it.

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.360
I was really impressed at how easy this was.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.360
No, because I don't even need an API key for this one.

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:20.360
This is just a publicly available endpoint.

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.360
Interesting.

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:25.360
But it has authenticated APIs for following and tooting and all of that kind of stuff.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.360
So yeah, this is very, very hackable.

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:34.360
And one thing I find exciting is, so I've built Twitter bots in the past, and it always feels like you're in a ask permission or ask forgiveness situation.

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:41.360
You launch a bot and you're always crossing your fingers that somebody, the powers that be might not go, no, that's a bad bot and turn it off for you.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.360
Mastodon, there are no, like you can run a bot on your own instance.

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.360
If you misbehave, the worst that can happen to your instance will be defederated, which is bad.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:53.360
So don't do bad bots, but you can build a bot that does absolutely anything.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:57.360
And especially if it only interacts with people who follow it, what's the harm, right?

00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:02.360
Nobody's going to get upset with your bot spamming people if people have to follow it to get alerts from it.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:10.360
But I think we're going to see so much innovation around bots on this platform because it's so easy and liberating to start writing these auto-signments.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.360
I checked out toot.

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.360
If you look at the PyPI listing, it just gives you a description.

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:22.360
And if you click on take me to the documentation, it takes you to the documentation for the UI thing.

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.360
It's really not clear how to use it.

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:28.360
But I ended up just doing basically what you said.

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:34.360
And I used toot to create the OAuth registration and the access keys and all that.

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:38.360
And then I just wrote some straight Python code using HTTPX against the API.

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:42.360
And now on my stream deck, I have a little button I can press right here.

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.360
Every time I want to announce that a live stream is starting, click that thing and off it goes.

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.360
And so programming, like you said, is pretty hackable.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.360
This is just so cool.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.360
Yeah, this is fun.

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.360
This is real fun.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:56.360
I'm looking for a little dataset plugin for this because I think that would be pretty darn cool.

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.360
And congrats on the five year in a birth rate.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.360
Thank you.

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.360
Yeah, it was the project's birthday yesterday.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.360
Yeah, no, I want to do a plugin.

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:07.360
I'm waiting for Andrew in Tag Tech.

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.360
I pronounced it correctly earlier and I've forgotten.

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.360
I'm waiting for Andrew to solve all of the problems.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:16.360
And I'm just going to copy and paste code after that and build a plugin based on the things that he's already figured out.

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:23.360
But yeah, I want Dataset to be able to both ingest from ActivityPub and publish to ActivityPub, all via plugins.

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.360
It feels like it would be a really natural fit, definitely.

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.360
I guess maybe let's close this out with, well, not that yet.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:37.360
Though I want to close this out talking about funding and how, Simon, you mentioned the business model.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.360
I think it's so transparent.

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.360
It's like there are no ads.

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.360
This is volunteer run.

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:42.360
It's volunteer money.

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.360
If you can afford, you can, you should pay.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:47.360
And I think we should all be paying $8 a month for this on prints.

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:51.360
If we can afford to do so, I think that's the right amount to commit.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:56.360
There's an instance called social.coop, for example, that works as an open collective project.

00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:02.360
So to become part of it, you have to pay and it becomes a collective effort that way.

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.360
And I think that's really interesting too.

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.360
That is very interesting.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.360
I only read this about the faucet on.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:11.360
So, you know, look at your instance of interest, I suppose.

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:21.360
And if you look at this, they have a funding page over here and they actually have open numbers about how much it costs to run, how, how much scaling they've had to do recently.

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:27.360
So it said two weeks ago, we paid $100 a month and now we pay $1,000 a month.

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.360
And here's how much money.

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.360
So how much runway we have at this current rate.

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:35.360
They also talked about how many users they had in here somewhere.

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:41.360
It went from something like 2000 to 40,000 in a week, which is pretty interesting.

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:51.360
But if you think about this, like, so they need $1,000 to run this server and this infrastructure, and they actually break it down by piece of infrastructure, like CDN versus servers.

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:58.360
And you take 40,000 and a thousand divided by 40,000, you know, that turns out to be like 2 cents a month to run this.

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:10.360
We can have a world that's not infested with ad companies and algorithms that are trying to manipulate us to buy things or to vote this way or that way or to be angry about this cause or that cause.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.360
For 2.5 cents a month.

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.360
That's insane.

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:13.360
Right.

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:15.360
We, we should absolutely be doing this.

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:21.360
The old cliche is if, if, if, if, if something is free, you're if the, if the product is free, then you are the product.

00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.360
You're the thing being sold.

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:25.360
This is our chance to show that we understand that lesson, right?

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:27.360
This is right now.

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.360
We want to use the software.

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.360
We have the option to pay for it.

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.360
We should pay for it.

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.360
And like I said, not everyone needs to pay for it.

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:36.360
I like the $8 thing, because if you can afford it, then throw in that $8.

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.360
People who can't afford it, we want them around anyway.

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:40.360
So, so let's cover the costs for them.

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.360
But yeah, I, I, I'm not worried about the financial sustainability of this, of this thing.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:50.360
If we, if, if even a small minority of us do the right thing and help pay for it, I think it's going to be fine.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:57.360
I think it makes good sense for the ones that want to be sustained long-term to be very transparent with the finances.

00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:06.360
I know we did that with my binder.org and that really helped either grant money or bringing on other, you know, federated instances.

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:14.360
And I think it gives people like, Hey, you know, people are putting in their time as well as the financial resources.

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:16.360
I, for one, I'm happy to pay for that.

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:20.360
I would pay more than $8 a month just so that, you know, there's no ads.

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:21.360
There's no ads.

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.360
In fact, I do on certain services.

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:32.360
So, but I, you know, I think the other thing to maybe keep in mind is given how quickly it's growing and the fact that there are maintainers of Mastodon itself.

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:42.360
Be kind to those maintainers as you want new features and things, because having been on the other side of, Oh, you don't have this.

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.360
This was a stupid way of doing that.

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.360
You know what?

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.360
They made good decisions.

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:53.360
Those were the decisions they made and, you know, support them as they learn how to scale even more.

00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.360
So don't forget that there's people behind the efforts.

00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:01.360
Just because they have more money than it costs to run at the current moment.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:07.360
Mike and I don't remember the other person who runs faucet on and this goes, you know, for all the servers, these people are taking a lot of their time.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:13.360
They, they said there's been so much of an influx, you know, a 20 X growth in users and servers and so on.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.360
It's been almost like a second full-time job.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:24.360
So I think we should consider, you know, how do we make it something that is not a tremendous unwanted burden for these people who put together these places for us.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.360
So, right.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.360
It shouldn't just go, well, they need a thousand.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.360
They got a thousand.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.360
They're good.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.360
There should be something more than that to help them.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.360
And we are technically minded people.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.360
We can volunteer our time.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:38.360
People like volunteering to help with moderation, volunteering to help with, with systems administration.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.360
These are all things that we should be ready to do as well.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360
Yeah.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.360
And at the same time, I think like the technology will only improve, right?

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:52.360
Like Andrew Godwin just created a jungle asynchronous Fediverse server in what, seven days.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.360
That's completely astonishing.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.360
But the more the technology evolves.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.360
And I think it's happening now that the human problems are going to become more and more apparent.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:10.360
And probably some instances will have, will want to have full-time moderators or even part-time and they will want, I don't know, like marketing people, graphical design, communications.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:13.360
They will want to coordinate with other instances.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:22.360
They will want to, I don't know, fund progress in the activity pub, protocols that it's more robust and more feature complete, whatever.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:27.360
So, like the more money we pour into the ecosystem, I think it's going to be good.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.360
If there's like good accountability of how this money is spent and so forth.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.360
And if it's as cheap as two cents a person, let's just go for it.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.360
Yeah.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.360
Yeah.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.360
I, why, why not?

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.360
Right.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:47.360
They have Patreon and also not just your entrance, but instance, but Mastodon, the bigger org also has a funding option.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.360
I, for one, think this is a really lovely place to be.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.360
I'm excited by what I found.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:02:00.360
I saw a lot of comments in the live stream here that people found the noise, signal to noise ratio much higher over in Mastodon.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.360
People felt very welcome there.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.360
The kindness was really apparent there.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.360
So I didn't end up here for the reason that I expected.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:14.360
As Juan pointed out, some narcissistic guy went, banged around on Twitter for a while, tried to break it.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.360
We'll see how that turns out, but I'm really glad that I ended up here.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.360
So, yeah, it's, it's very cool.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.360
Yeah.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.360
Maybe we'll go top to bottom sort of, yeah.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.360
Final thoughts on this, Carol.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:28.360
I think it's a great alternative to have in our ability to communicate.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:37.360
I hope somebody who knows it well, writes a good onboarding experience for those of us that are relatively new.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:44.360
it wasn't hard to get started, but there were a lot of decisions that maybe aren't quite apparent when you first started.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.360
Yeah.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:03:01.360
I think we will probably see some changes maybe here and there as more and more people go in there and need to first get, yeah, get, get into the, into the way that we talk there into the way this, how, how this all works, how the community rules are and all that.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:08.360
So I think there might be some bad things that will happen sooner or later, the bigger this, this stuff gets.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:18.360
But I think, the community as a whole so far has shown that in theory, it should be, ready for that and should be able to solve that.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:26.360
And it, yeah, big, big, big parts of how to solve these situations are in the issues are already built into the very protocol into the very concept.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.360
So I have high hopes that this is here to stay.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360
Yeah.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:45.360
It feels like Twitter back in 29 or even, I don't know if anyone else still remembers this, but before there was Twitter, I was on identica, which also was something like, like Mastodon basically also federated.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.360
If I remember correctly, I'm not 100% sure.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:55.360
And, so yeah, it feels a bit like the internet used to feel, and I really enjoy that as an old timer.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:55.360
Yeah.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:03.360
So same as you, Michael, I'm so glad that the pediverse and the Mastodon community so far is so friendly in general.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:13.360
At the same time, I'm looking forward to having more conversations about what's next, what are the current challenges, what are the bottlenecks that are perhaps limiting adoption somehow.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:16.360
Are we prepared for the next influx of users?

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:24.360
Like, I don't know where if Twitter collapses effectively next year, is the pediverse ready to take that amount of users in?

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.360
Do we want that sort of thing?

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:41.360
I think there's lots of questions to be asked, but at the same time, it feels so exciting that we're in a position to do that from a community perspective, with a distributed responsibility way of doing things.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.360
Well, I'm not deleting my Twitter account just yet.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.360
I will keep it around just in case.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:49.360
But definitely, I'm Mastodon and the Fediverse first.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:59.360
Now, I really want to have all my favorite people, all my favorite projects tooting from the Fediverse, whatever instance they land on.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360
And yeah, we're excited about the future.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.360
Yeah, I completely agree with you.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:01.360
Thanks, Simon.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.360
I've got a call to action for people.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.360
Toot about nice things.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:17.360
Something I've been doing every day, I try and put up a message about one of my projects, which I do hash projects on, and I'm encouraging other people to do exactly the same thing.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.360
It's like, like, celebrate things that we've built.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:30.360
I try and if you click on media, I try and post a wildlife photo every day as well, tag with wildlife photography, because who doesn't want to see a photograph of a pelican in their feed?

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.360
Does your dog have a Mastodon feed?

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:37.360
Not yet. No, I haven't moved. She hasn't moved over to Twitter yet, but she should do.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.360
She's not upset yet. She's still just sticking with that group. She's not upset.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.360
She's a bit old fashioned on that front. Yeah.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.360
But yeah, host nice things.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.360
Reply to people. Get involved.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:52.360
One of the things that we're all enjoying about Mastodon is that people are nice to each other and talk about interesting things.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.360
So get on there and talk about interesting things and be nice to people.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.360
That's the best thing that we can be doing right now.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.360
I love that message.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:04.360
Thank you, Simon, for the project hashtag because I have had a blast reading through that and also participating in that.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.360
Excellent. Fantastic. It's really fun. Yeah.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.360
Yeah, totally.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:15.360
And I'll be sure to link to everybody's Mastodon profile so you can follow all the guests as I always do.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.360
But I think that's especially relevant now.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.360
Everyone's coming over. It's a little bit different to find folks and connect.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:29.360
But my experience is Mastodon is very active, very full of Python people who are friendly and excited to be there.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.360
And so it's a great place. It's not just a couple of people who are there.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.360
It's a great community and folks should check it out.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.360
Carol, Gina, Juan, Simon, it's been great to have you all here.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.360

AWS is the lead cloud for developers, but with over 250 services, it's an overwhelming set of choices.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.360
