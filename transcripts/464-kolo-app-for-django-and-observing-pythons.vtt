00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.100
Do you want to look inside your Django requests?

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.300
How about all of your requests in development and see where they overlap?

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.140
If that sounds useful, you should definitely check out Colo.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.060
It's a pretty incredible extension for your editor.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.980
VS Code at the moment, more editors to come.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.740
Most likely we have Wilhelm Klopp on to tell us all about it.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.100

Hello.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.340
Yeah.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.300
Excited to be here, Michael.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.220
I've been listening to Talk Python like for, I can't even remember how long, but

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.700
I'm pretty sure it was before I had a first Python job.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.780
So yeah, a long, long time.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.180
That's amazing.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.080
Well, now you're helping create it.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.860
Yeah, exactly.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.540
We're going to talk about Colo, your Visual Studio Code Django.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.700
I don't even know what to call it.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.620
It's pretty advanced, pretty in-depth extension seems to be not quite enough.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.760
So what any project people are going to really dig that people who Django and

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.600
we'll see what the future plans are.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.160
If we could talk you into other, other ones, but for now Django plus.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.720
100%.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.120
Yeah.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.360
Yeah.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.880
Django plus VS Code is going to be super interesting.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.720
When we get to that, of course, you must know the drill.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720
Tell us a bit about yourself.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.460
Yeah, for sure.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.800
So my name is Will.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.400
I've been using Django since, well, I guess I've been using Python since about

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.320
2013, I want to say.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.860
So a little over 10 years and yeah, just kind of like fell in love with it.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.580
Wanted to make websites, started using Django and yeah, I guess never really

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.140
looked back.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.100
That was in school back then, but kind of always had a love for like tinkering and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.180
building side projects.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.060
I actually studied, I did a management degree in university, but I really loved

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.820
hanging out with all the computer science kids, all the computer science students.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.460
And I think a part of me really wanted to impress them.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.340
So I was always building side projects.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.600
And one of them was actually a Slack app called SimplePol.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.600
And yeah, we were trying to like, you know, organize something in Slack and really

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.880
felt like the need for polls.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.000
So built this little side project just like during university.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.880
And then it became really, really popular.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.200
And a few years later it became my full-time job.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.240
So for the past like four years, I've been running SimplePol as a Slack app,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.560
building out the team up to like seven, eight of us.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.880
And I had a great time doing that.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.900
In the middle, I actually worked at GitHub for two years, working on Ruby and Rails.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.860
And that was super fun, like a great company, great people, huge code base.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.940
Learned a lot there.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.860
That was really fun.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.540
But yeah, I left after about two years to work full-time on SimplePol.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.900
So SimplePol had been running as a side project kind of in the background.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.380
And actually it's interesting, like, and in kind of the order of events, thinking

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.460
back, Microsoft was, acquired GitHub while I was there.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.980
And then suddenly all of my colleagues started talking about buying boats and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.880
leaving the company.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:53.160
And I thought, hmm, I don't quite have boat money, but how can I, what's an ace

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.360
I might have up my sleeve?

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.600
And it was SimplePol, which had got like tons of users, but I never monetized it.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.280
So I set out to monetize it.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.040
And then a year later it was actually bringing in more revenue than my salary

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.480
at GitHub.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.320
So I decided, decided to quit.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.080
So that's kind of the SimplePol backstory.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.280
So SimplePol is a Django app, reasonably sized now, a bunch of people working on

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.480
it.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.380
And then, yeah, at some point in the journey of building SimplePol, I kind of

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.100
started playing around with Kolo.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.940
So Kolo also kind of, just like SimplePol started as a side project, but now not to

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.260
make polls in Slack, but instead to improve my own developer experience building

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.780
SimplePol.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.340
So kind of built it as an, as my own tool for making Django, working with Django

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.820
more fun, give me more insight, give me access to some of the data that I felt

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.020
was so close, but that I had to just like manually get in there and print out.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.280
So the reason Kolo started out as supporting just Django and VS Code is because

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.800
that's what I was using and it was an internal side project.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.280
And now actually handed over SimplePol to a new CEO.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.360
I'm no longer involved day to day and I'm working full time on Kolo.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.080
Man, congratulations on like multiple levels.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.640
That's awesome.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.040
Thank you.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.480
Yeah.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.000
I want to talk to you a bit about SimplePol for just a minute, but before then you

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.060
pointed out like, look, I made this side project and how many hours are you

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.540
spending on it a week maybe?

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.180
Oh, it was interesting.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.100
So honestly, like, so this would like right at the beginning, like when it, when it

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.980
was first started, I, yeah, it's a good time.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.260
It's a good, it's a good question.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.700
The, I always joke that the best thing about my management degree was that I had

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.540
a lot of free time to like do build side projects.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.620
Honestly, I think it could have been like 20, 30, 40 hours a week.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.940
Yeah.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.380
Yeah.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.660
That was, yeah, I think, yeah, it definitely varied week to week.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.460
And then later on?

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.940
Yeah.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.460
And then while I was working, when I had a full-time job as a software engineer,

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.500
yeah, that was a lot tougher.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.700
It was like nights and weekends rarely had energy during the week to work on it.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.580
And then honestly, like, since it was a real project with real users, I ended up

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.220
spending a lot of the weekend doing like support, like support stuff.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.100
Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.720
Support.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.860
And like, then you charge and then now you have finance stuff and like legal stuff to

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.500
do so that, that wasn't super fun.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.860
Like it really slows down the features and the creation of stuff.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.220
Exactly.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.700
Yeah.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.580
I would say I probably spent fully 50% of my full-time job doing email support, that

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.260
kind of stuff, you know, just like there's tons of people taking courses and listen to

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.140
the podcast and they'll have questions and thoughts and you know, and it's, it's

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.620
awesome, but it also is really tricky.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.620
So the reason I ask is I always find it fascinating.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.220
You'll see like news articles.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.620
I don't know.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.900
They're always click baity or whatever.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.660
This person makes three times their job working 10 hours a week on this other

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.940
thing, like you make three times what you make for your job.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.140
What are you doing at your job?

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.100
Right.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.020
The ability to say you can make that step where you go from kind of tired at nights,

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.620
extra time and squeezing on the weekends to full-time full energy.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.860
Yeah.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.100
If it's already doing well, you know, on like a very thin life support, like then

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.900
give it full energy, you know, full time and energy.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.660
It's just, of course it's going to be better.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.900
Right.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.540
It's so interesting.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.180
I actually have a lot of thoughts about this.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.460
Maybe I should write something about this at some point, but yeah, I actually think

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.540
running like a bootstrap side project kind of business as you have a job can be really

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.620
good because it really forces you to prioritize and build the most important

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.060
things.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.340
Yeah.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.620
It's kind of like having kids.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.180
Oh, nice.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.380
Yeah.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.460
Yeah.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.660
I need to try that someday.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.580
You'll be real tired.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.420
I tell you, you'll, you'll love to prioritize your time.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.060
Yeah.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.660
I think it really forced you to prioritize.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.460
So I actually sometimes recommend when folks ask me like for advice, like should I quit

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.140
my job to go all in or not?

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.980
I actually sometimes think there's a lot of nice stability and that comes from, from

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.540
having a job.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.820
Plus it's actually really nice to have coworkers.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.940
It's nice to have structure.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.980
Like you actually need to take all of that.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.500
Well, work in a way on yourself.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.260
Like it's, you know, if you have to make your own structure, like if you're building

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.460
your own thing and that can actually be a bit tricky.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.980
Like I really struggled with that at the beginning.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.380
So I think there's something to be said for, yeah.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.620
For, for spending like a limited time on something basically and prioritizing just,

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.060
just the most interesting angle.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.100
And I don't necessarily disagree with that.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.860
I know that's interesting.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.020
So for me, it was interesting, like in terms of like how much, like, you know, life

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.460
support energy you put in versus like full time energy.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.260
It was growing decently.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:07.180
Like while I was still at GitHub and I thought, okay, I'm going to go in on this

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.860
full time.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:13.100
And if I go from like 10 hours a week or less to like 40 hours a week, that would

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.860
probably Forex the growth rate as well.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.860
That's how it works.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.140
Right.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.860
And like, totally didn't like it totally didn't work.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:25.020
In fact, like the month after I left, I had like my first down month where like the

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.100
revenue decreased.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.340
And I was like, wait a minute, what's going on here?

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.500
How that doesn't make any sense.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.300
That's not fair.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.660
So I think that also points that like there, yeah, you can definitely spend more hours

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.700
on something and it can be like the wrong things or not doubling down on something

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.580
that's really working.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:44.100
So, but overall, obviously you, at some point, like just being able to like test out

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.940
more ideas is like really valuable.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.140
And for that, like, if you only have time to do support on your product, that's really

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.740
working well.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.540
And your full time job is the rest of the, how you spend your week, then yeah, it feels

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.940
like you should give yourself some time to build features and maybe quit the job.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:59.340
Yeah.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:05.420
It's also an interesting point about the structure because not everyone is going to

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.860
get up at eight o'clock, sit at their desk and, and they're going to be like, you know,

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.540
I kind of could just do whatever.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.060
And it's, it's a, it's its own discipline, its own learned skill.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:14.660
A hundred percent.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:14.900
Yeah.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.220
I remember like one of the first weeks after I was full time on SimplePool, I woke up in

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.220
the morning and said, well, the money's coming in.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.180
I don't need to work.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:23.980
I don't have a boss.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.340
And I just sit in bed and watch YouTube videos all day.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.140
And then I just felt miserable at the end of the day.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.620
Like the, I was like, this is supposed to feel great.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.780
Why all this freedom I've wanted and dreamt about for so long?

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.580
Where like, why does it not feel great?

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.260
Yeah.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.140
Also, also feels like risk and more different kinds of responsibility.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:42.660
All right.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.140
So SimplePool, the reason I said it'd be worth talking about a little bit is, you know,

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.020
Slack's a popular platform and this is based on Django, right?

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.860
So SimplePool is a full on Django app.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.140
Yeah.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.260
And it's funny.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.660
Sometimes people joke that, I don't know if you've gone through the official Django

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.780
tutorial, but in there you actually make a polls app in the browser.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.180
Sometimes people joke, wait, did you just turn this into like a Slack app?

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.620
And then you productize it.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.940
The getting started tutorial.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.500
Yeah, exactly.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.980
But yeah, like it turned out that like polls and then yeah, getting, you know, your team

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.700
more connected and Slack and more engaged are like things people really care about.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.580
So it came to the Slack, SimplePool joined the Slack platform like at the perfect time

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.220
and has just been growing super well since then.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:32.100
Tell people a little bit about what it takes technically to make a Slack app.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.580
I mean, Slack is not built in Python as far as I know.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.940
And it's, it's probably JavaScript and Electron, mostly the people interact with.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.140
Right.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.060
So what is the deal here?

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.100
It's actually super interesting.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.180
So the way you build like a Slack app, it's actually all backend based.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.980
So when a user interacts in Slack, Slack sends your app, your backend, like a JSON

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.580
payload saying like this user clicked this button, and then you can just send a JSON

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.780
payload back saying, all right, now show this message.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.820
Now show this modal.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:05.340
And they have their own JSON based block kit framework where you can render different

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.220
types of content.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.340
So you don't actually have to think about JavaScript or react or any of their stack at

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:10.700
all.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.700
It's basically all sending JSON payloads around and calling various parts of the Slack

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.180
API.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.300
So you can build a Slack app in your favorite language, any kind of exotic language if you

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:20.860
want it to.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.140
But yeah, I love Python.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.260
So I decided to build it in Python and Django.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.380
So yeah, actually building Slack apps is a really like pleasant experience.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.940
What's the deployment backend story look like?

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.140
Is it a pass sort of thing?

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.380
Serverless?

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.180
VMs?

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.460
At the time it was Heroku.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.900
Simplify was running on Heroku.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.700
And then I think a few years ago we migrated it to AWS.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.580
So now it's running on AWS and ECS.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.020
Nice.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.540
Okay.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.020
So Docker for the win.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.460
Right on.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.540
How does it work in Talk Python?

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:52.980
I'm curious.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.500
How, what's, where are you deployed?

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.980
It's all DigitalOcean.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:04.300
And then I have one big like eight CPU server running, I think, 16 different Django apps.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.820
Not Django, sorry, Docker apps.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:12.300
No, sorry, Docker apps that are all doing like, you know, some of them share a database that's in

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:19.700
Docker and some of them do sort of have their own self-contained pair of like web app and

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.780
database and so on.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.500
But it's all Docker on one big server, which is fairly new for me.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.620
And it's glorious.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.340
It's glorious.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:27.940
That's awesome.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:28.660
Very cool.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:28.980
Yeah.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.980
All right.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.500
So again, congrats on this.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.180
Very, very neat.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.060
Let's talk Colo.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:35.620
Let's do it.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.660
I first came across this, I've come across it independently twice.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:48.420
Once when the Django chat guys recommended that I talk to you because they're like, Will's doing

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:48.980
cool stuff.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.020
You should definitely talk to him.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.980
Saying a thing for VS Code is super cool.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:58.620
But also I can't remember, there's somebody on your team whose social media profile I came across

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.740
and I saw this and I'm like, oh, this is, this is pretty neat.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.300
I think we even covered it on the Python Bytes podcast.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:04.940
Oh, no way.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.540
Let's see.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.260
Yeah, sure.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.500
In January we did.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.900
So that's what we talked about a little bit, but this just looks like such a neat thing.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:17.460
And it's, I encourage people to, who may be interested in this, to visit colo.app because

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.060
it's a super visual sort of experience of understanding your code.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:21.380
Right?

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.020
Would you agree?

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.420
Yeah.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.300
I mean, a hundred percent.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:23.620
Yeah.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.460
Funny thought.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:30.060
I hadn't really thought that a podcast is going to be a hard way to describe the visual beauty

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.260
and magic that Colo can bring to your code.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.620
But yeah, a hundred percent.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:33.820
Yeah.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.860
So Colo like very much started as like the idea of, Hey, like I should be able to see

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.740
like how my code actually flows.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.260
I think like all of us, as we build software, as we write our Python code, we have this

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.340
kind of like mental model of how all the different functions like fit together.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.340
How like a bit of data ends up from like the beginning, like to the end, like it passes

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.020
through maybe a bunch of functions, it passes through a bunch of like classes, a bunch of

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.260
loops, all the state gets like modified.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.100
And we have this kind of like mental picture of all of that in our head.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:09.620
And the kind of very beginning of Colo, the question I asked myself was like, is there

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.580
a way we can just like visualize that?

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.580
Is there a way we can just actually print that out onto a screen?

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.900
So if you go to colo.app, it kind of looks like this funny sun chart with like lots of

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:25.100
kind of a sunny tree chart with lots of nodes, nodes going from the center and like going

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.740
off into the distance, which I think is like, yeah, similar to like what folks kind of

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.780
might already have in their head about like how the code flows.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:40.020
Maybe another way to describe it is imagine like you enable a debugger at the

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:45.020
beginning of every function and at the end of every function in your code and you print

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:49.420
out like what was the function name, what were the input arguments, what was the return

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.180
value? And then you arrange all of that in a graph that then shows which function called

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.020
which other function.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.140
It almost looks like what you get out of profilers.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.180
Right. You know, where you say like, OK, this function took 20 percent, but if you

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.420
expand it out, I'll say, well, it really spent 5 percent there, 10 percent there, and

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.900
then a bunch of it. And you kind of traverse that.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:08.620
A hundred percent.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.140
Yeah. I'm guessing you're not really interested in how long it took, although maybe you

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.620
can probably get that out of it.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.900
It's the important is more what is the dependency?

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.340
What are the variables being passed and like understanding individual behavior, right?

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.380
Or maybe. Yeah.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.420
What do you think? Yeah, a hundred percent.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.700
I think like it's interesting because Colo actually uses under the hood like a bunch of

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.420
the Python profiling APIs and people often think of Colo as a profiler.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.900
We do actually have a traditional profiling based chart which puts the timing at the

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.700
center. But you're absolutely right that the focus of our like main chart, the one that

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:46.060
we're both looking at that has like this idea of the function overview and like which

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.300
function calls which the idea there is like absolutely the hierarchy and seeing like

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.420
giving yourself that same mental model that someone who's worked on a code base for

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.620
three months has in their head immediately like yourself by just looking at it.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:03.300
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Sentry.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.700
Code breaks. It's a fact of life.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.900
With Sentry, you can fix it faster.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.900
As I've told you all before, we use Sentry on many of our apps and APIs here at

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.540
Talk Python. I recently used Sentry to help me track down one of the weirdest bugs I've

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.260
run into in a long time.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.940
Here's what happened. When signing up for our mailing list, it would crash under a

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.780
non-common execution pass like situations where someone was already subscribed or

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.940
entered an invalid email address or something like this.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:38.060
The bizarre part was that our logging of that unusual condition itself was crashing.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.220
How is it possible for her log to crash?

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.780
It's basically a glorified print statement.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.580
Well, Sentry to the rescue.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.940
I'm looking at the crash report right now, and I see way more information than you'd

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.900
expect to find in any log statement.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.980
And because it's production, debuggers are out of the question.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:01.260
I see the traceback, of course, but also the browser version, client OS, server OS,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.980
server OS version, whether it's production or Q&A, the email and name of the person

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.900
signing up. That's the person who actually experienced the crash.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.740
Dictionaries of data on the call stack and so much more.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.740
What was the problem?

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:18.060
I initialized the logger with the string info for the level rather than the

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.380
enumeration dot info, which was an integer based enum.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.260
So the logging statement would crash saying that I could not use less than or equal to

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.820
between strings and ints.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.340
Crazy town.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.900
But with Sentry, I captured it, fixed it, and I even helped the user who experienced

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.500
that crash.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.980
Don't fly blind.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.660
Fix code faster with Sentry.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.660
Create your Sentry account now at talkpython.fm/sentry.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:49.900
And if you sign up with the code TALKPYTHON, all capital, no spaces, it's good for two

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.940
free months of Sentry's business plan, which will give you up to 20 times as many

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.020
monthly events as well as other features.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:02.260
Usually in the way these charts turn out, you can notice that there's like points of

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.700
interest. Like there's one function that has a lot of children.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.820
So that clearly is coordinating like a bunch of the work where you can see kind of

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.100
similarities in the structure of some of the sub trees.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.780
So, you know, OK, maybe that's like a loop and it's the same thing happening a couple

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:21.220
times. So you can essentially I get this overview and then it's fully interactive and

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.780
you can dive in to like what exactly is happening.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.100
Yeah. Is it interactive?

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.060
So I can like click on these pieces and it'll pull them up.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.060
We actually and this is what's it'll be live by the time this podcast goes live.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.860
We actually have a playground in the browser.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.020
This is also super fun.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.100
We can talk about this. Well, let me drop you a link real quick.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.340
This will be a play.colo.app.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:45.020
So with this, yeah, this is super fun because this is fully Python just running in the

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.460
browser using Pyodide and like WebAssembly.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.540
Nice. OK.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.780
But yeah, so this is the fully visual version where you can.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.180
Yeah. It defaults to loading like a simple Fibonacci algorithm.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:00.300
Yeah. And you can see like what the visualization of Fibonacci looks like.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.500
And you can actually edit the code and see how it changes with your edits and all of

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.140
that. We have a couple other examples.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.300
Wow. The pandas one and the whack-a-mole one are pretty intense.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.380
They're pretty wild pictures.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.060
They look like sort of Japanese fans or whatever.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.540
You know, those little gamer ones.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.540
We once had a competition at a conference to see who could make like the most fun

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.340
looking algorithm and then visualize it with Colo.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.980
But yeah, like it's fun.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.620
Like visualizing code is really great.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.380
That's awesome. So this is super cool.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.660
It's just just all from scratch.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.860
It's besides Pyodide here.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.700
Not like VS Code in the browser or anything like that.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.340
I think it's using Monaco in this case or CodeMirror.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.620
But otherwise, this is all is this Pyodide and a little bit of React to like pull kind

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.980
of the data together. But yeah, we're really.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.180
Yeah. It's otherwise homemade.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:51.380
This is kind of like the kind of what Colo has been for like like the past like two

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.940
years or so has been this kind of side project for our SimplePool to help like just

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.700
visualize and understand code better.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.700
The SimplePool codebase, to be honest, has grown so large that like there's parts of

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.540
it that I wrote like five years ago that I don't understand anymore.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.620
And it's like annoying to get back to that and having to spend like a day to

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.220
re-familiarize myself with everything.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.860
It's a lot nicer to just like to actually kind of explain like end to end how it

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:19.740
works. You install like in a Django project, you install Colo as a as a middleware.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:26.580
And then as you just browse and use your Django app and make requests, traces get

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.980
saved. So Colo records these traces.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.060
They actually get saved in a local SQLite database.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.820
Then you can view the traces, which includes the visualization, but also like lots of

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.420
other data like you can actually see in the version you have there.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.180
Like we show every single function call, like the inputs and outputs for each

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.340
function call. So that main idea of Colo is to like really show you everything that

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.500
happened in your code.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:53.220
So in a Django app, that would be like the request, the response, like all the headers,

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.660
every single function call, input and output, outbound requests, SQL queries as

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.220
well. So really the goal is to show you everything.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.300
You can view these stored traces either through VS Code.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.660
And this is also will be live by the time this episode goes live through like a web

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.540
middleware version, which is a bit similar to Django debug toolbar.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.940
Not sure if you've played around much with Django debug.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.940
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. And those things are actually pretty impressive.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.500
Right. I played out with that one and the pyramid one.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.820
And you can see more than I think you would reasonably expect from just a little thing

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.860
on the side of your web app.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.780
Yeah, exactly. And that's very much our goal to like very kind of deep insight in our

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.180
minds. This is almost like a bit like old news.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.860
Like we've been using this for like a few years, basically.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.060
And then at some point, like last year, we started playing around with this idea of

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:46.580
like, OK, so we have this trace that has information about like pretty much everything

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.060
that happened in like a request.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:52.700
Is there any way we could use that to solve this like reasonably large pain point for

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.380
us, which is like writing tests?

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.860
I'm actually curious. Do you enjoy writing tests?

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.900
I'll tell you what I used to actually.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.020
I used to really enjoy writing tests.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.900
I used to enjoy thinking a lot about it.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:08.740
And then as the projects would get bigger, I'm like, you know, this is these tests don't

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.820
really cover what I need them to cover anymore.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.940
And they're kind of dragging it down.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.300
And then, you know, the thing that really kind of knocked it out for me is I'd have

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.900
like teammates and they wouldn't care about the test at all.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:23.180
So they would write, break the tests or just write a bunch of code without tests.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.300
And I felt kind of like like a parent cleaning up after kids.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.340
You're like, why is it so?

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.780
Can we just pick up? Why are there dishes here?

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.780
And they're just going around.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.100
I'm like, this is not what I want to do.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.660
Like, I want to just write software.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.380
And I understand the value of tests, of course.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.300
A hundred percent.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:45.340
Yeah. At the same time, I feel like maybe higher order integration tests often, for

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:50.100
me at least, serve more value because it's like I could write 20 little unit tests or I

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.140
could write two integration tests and it's probably going to work.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.860
I'm actually completely with you on that.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.780
OK, right on.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:00.860
The bang for the buck of integration tests are like great, like really, really useful.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.420
You can almost think of tests as having like two purposes, one being like, well,

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.340
actually, I think this would be too simple an explanation.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.660
Let me let me not make grand claims about all the uses of tests.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:17.540
I think the most the use of it that most people are after is this idea of like what I've

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.020
built isn't going to break by accident.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:25.300
Yeah. Like you want confidence that any future change you make doesn't impact a bunch

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.900
of unrelated stuff that it's not supposed to impact.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.140
I think that's what most people are after with with tests.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:37.100
And I think for that specific desired result, like integration tests are the way to go.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.940
And there's some cool writing about this from I wrote a little blog post about Colos

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.340
test generation abilities.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.540
And in there, I link to a post from Kent C.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.940
Dodds from the JavaScript community, who has a great post about I think it's called

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:55.620
write tests, not too many, mostly integration, kind of after this idea of like, yeah, nice.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.500
Eat not too much, mostly vegetables.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.220
I think that's the.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.140
Yeah, exactly.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:00.700
Exactly.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.060
Yeah.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.060
I'm a big fan of that.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.180
And actually, it's interesting.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.300
I've speaking to a bunch of folks over the past year about tests.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.420
A lot of engineers think about writing tests as vegetables.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.660
And obviously, some people love vegetables and some of us love writing tests.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.700
But it seems like for a lot of folks, it's kind of like a obviously necessary part of

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.860
creating great software.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.540
But it's maybe not like the most fun part of our job.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:29.780
Or you pick up some project, you're a consultant, or you're taking over some open

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.900
source project, you're like, this has no tests, right?

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.020
It's kind of like running a linter.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.460
And it says there's a thousand errors.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.700
You're like, well, we're not going to do that.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:41.180
Yeah, we're just not going to run the linter against it because it's just too messed up

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.220
at this point, right?

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.580
It's interesting you mentioned the picking up like a project with no tests, because I

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.260
think within the next three months, we're not quite there yet.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.820
But I think in the next three months with Colo's test generation abilities, we'll have

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.820
a thing where, yeah, all we need is a Python code base to get started.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.580
And then we can bring that to like a really respectable level of code coverage just by

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.260
using Colo.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:01.620
Okay.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.100
How?

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:08.020
That's kind of describing a second ago how like we, SimplePol has tons of integration

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.460
tests.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:13.460
SimplePol actually is about 80,000 lines of application code, not including migrations

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.980
and like config files.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.900
And then it's about 100,000 lines of tests.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.100
And most of that is integration tests.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.180
So SimplePol very well, very well tested lots of really mostly integration tests.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.460
But it is always a bit of a chore to like write them.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:33.020
So we started thinking about like, hmm, this like Colo tracing we're doing, can that help

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.300
us with making tests somehow?

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.140
And then we started experimenting with it.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.900
And like to our surprise, it's actually, yeah, I'm still sometimes surprised that it

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.580
actually works.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:47.420
But basically the idea is that if you have a trace that has that captures everything in

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:53.260
the request, you can kind of invert it to build a integration test.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.700
So let me give an example of what that means.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:01.540
The biggest challenge we found with creating integration tests is actually the test data

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:01.940
setup.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.780
So getting your application into the right shape before you can send a request to it or

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.300
before you can call a certain function, that's like kind of the hardest part.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.260
Writing the asserts is almost like easy or even like fun.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:15.540
Right.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:20.940
There's the three A's of unit testing range, assert, and act, wait, arrange, act, and

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:21.180
assert.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:21.620
Exactly.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:21.820
Yeah.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:21.980
Yeah.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.020
The first and the third one that you kind of have data on, right?

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:25.660
Exactly.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:25.900
Yeah.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.660
So we're like, wait a second.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.940
We actually can like kind of extract this, like the act.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:36.020
So like the setting, sorry, the arrange, setting up the data, the act, like actually

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:42.020
making the HDP request and then the assert, like to ensure the status change or that the

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.620
request go to 200 or something.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.740
We actually have the data for this.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.220
It's reasonably straightforward.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:50.700
Like if you capture in, you know, just your like normal, like imagine you have a local

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.500
to do app and you browse like a to do kind of demo, simple to do app and you browse to

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.860
the homepage and the homepage maybe lists the to dos.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.820
And if you've got Colo enabled, then Colo will have captured the request, right?

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.100
So like the request went to the homepage and it returned a 200.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:09.340
So that's already like two things we can now turn into code in our integration test.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:14.860
So first step being, well, I guess this is the act and the assert in the sense that the

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:19.060
assert is the 200 and then the act is firing off a request to the homepage.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:23.580
Now the tricky bit, and this is where it gets the most fun, is the arrange.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:29.060
So if we just put those two things into our test and our two imaginary test, there

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.260
wouldn't have been any to dos there.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:30.460
Right.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.820
So it's actually not an interesting test yet, but in your local version where the

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:38.980
trace was recorded, you actually had maybe like three to dos already, already in your

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.620
database.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.740
Does that make sense so far?

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.100
Yeah.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:41.860
Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:47.740
On the homepage, like your to do app might make a SQL query to like select all the to

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.340
dos or all the to dos for the currently logged in user.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:55.300
And then Colo would store that SQL query, would store that select and would also store

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.740
actually what data the database returned.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.460
This is actually something where, yeah, Colo goes beyond a lot of the existing kind of

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.540
like debugging tooling that might exist, like actually showing exactly what data the

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.660
database returned in a given SQL query.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.660
But imagine we get like a single to do returned, right?

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:18.700
We now know that to replicate this like trace in our test, we need to start by seeding

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.100
that to do into the database.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.540
That's where like the trace inversion comes in.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:29.060
If like a request starts with a select of like the to do table, then the first thing

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.900
that needs to happen in the integration test is actually a like creating like an insert

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.740
into the database for that to do.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.180
And now when you fire off the request to the homepage, it actually goes through your real

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.300
code path where like an actual to do gets loaded and gets printed out onto the page.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.260
So that's like the the most basic kind of example of like, how can you turn like a

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:55.700
locally captured trace of a request that like made a SQL query and return 200 into like

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.700
an integration test?

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.700
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:02.740
One of the things that makes me want to write fewer unit tests or not write a unit test

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:10.820
in a certain case is I can test given using mocking, given my let's say SQLAlchemy or

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:15.580
Beanie or whatever Django ORM model theoretically matches the database.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.060
I can do some stuff, set some values and check that that's all good.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:24.620
But in practice, if the if the shape, if the schema in the database doesn't match the

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.860
shape of my object, the system freaks out and crashes and says, well, that's not going

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.420
to work, right?

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.060
There's no way.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.740
And so it doesn't matter how good I mock it out.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.780
It has to go kind of end to end before I feel very good about it.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.180
Oh, yeah.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.940
OK, it's going to really, really work, right?

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.460
Exactly.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.780
That's an interesting story.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:45.540
Like you're saying to like, let's actually see if we can just create the data, but like

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.500
let it run all the way through.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:46.820
Right.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.820
I'm totally with you.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:51.620
And and I think I've often seen like unit tests pass and say, I mean, there's like lots

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.580
of memes about this, right?

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.500
How like unit tests say everything is good, but the server is down.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.500
Like, how is that possible?

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.700
I think in Django world, it's reasonably common to write integration tests like this, as in

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.500
like the actual database gets hit.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:08.620
The you have this idea of like the Django test client, which sends like a, you know,

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:14.180
real in air quotes, HTTP request through the entire Django stack as opposed to doing the

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.100
more unit test approach.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.620
So it hits the routes.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.820
It hits like all of that sort of stuff all the way.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.140
Yeah.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.020
And the template.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:21.340
Yeah.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.180
And then at the end, you can assert based on like the content of the response or you can

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:26.580
check.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:31.620
Like, imagine if we go back to the to do example, if we're testing like the add to do

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:36.500
endpoint or form submission, then you could make a database query at the end.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:41.060
And Kolo actually does this as well, because like, again, we know like that you inserted

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.460
to do in your request, so we can actually make an assert.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.060
This is a different example of the trace inversion.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:52.420
If there's an insert in your request that you captured, then we know at the end of the

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:56.340
integration test, we want to assert that this row now exists in the database.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:01.460
So you can assert at the very end to say, does this row actually exist in the database

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:01.660
now?

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.820
So it's a very nice kind of reasonably end to end, but still integration test.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:09.620
It's not like a brittle click around in the browser and kind of hope for the best kind of

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:09.940
thing.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.700
It's like, as we said at the beginning, I think like integration tests just get you

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.820
great bang for your buck.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.740
They really do.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:20.060
It's like the 80/20 rule of unit testing for sure.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:20.460
Yeah.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.580
Talk Python to me is partially supported by our training courses.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:29.060
If you're a regular listener of the podcast, you surely heard about Talk Python's online

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.700
courses, but have you had a chance to try them out?

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.940
No matter the level you're looking for, we have a course for you.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:39.260
Our Python for absolute beginners is like an introduction to Python plus that first

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.220
year computer science course that you never took.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:47.700
Our data-driven web app courses, build a full pypi.org clone along with you right on the

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.060
screen.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.980
And we even have a few courses to dip your toe in with.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:55.660
See what we have to offer at training.talkpython.fm or just click the link in your

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.380
podcast player.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.460
So is this all algorithmic?

00:31:59.460 --> 00:31:59.780
Yup.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:00.620
Great question.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.780
Is it LLMs?

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.420
Like how much VC funding are you looking for?

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.540
Like, you know, like if you got LLMs in there, like coming out of the woodwork.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.100
No, I'm just kidding.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.380
No, how do you, how does this happen?

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.940
It's actually all algorithmic and rule-based at the moment.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:20.820
So this idea of a select becomes like a, like a, an insert and an insert becomes like a

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.980
select assert.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.860
We were surprised how far we could get with just rules.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:29.340
The benefit we have is that we kind of have this like full-sized SimplePol Django code

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.740
base to play around with.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:35.940
And yeah, like generating integration tests in SimplePol just like fully works.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.300
There's a bunch of tweaks we like had to make to, as soon as I guess you work in kind of

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:46.500
like outside of a demo example, you want like time mocking and HTTP mocking and you want

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:52.340
to use your like factory boy factories and maybe you have a custom unit test, like base

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.420
class and all of this.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.580
But yeah, it like, it actually works now.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.180
I gave a talk at DjangoCon Europe last year.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:02.660
It's kind of like a bit of a wow moment in the audience where, yeah, you just click

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.660
generate test and it generates you like a hundred line integration test and the test

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.420
actually passes.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.820
So that was like, people started, just started clapping, which was a great feeling.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.420
I'm still a bit surprised that it works on it, but yeah, no LLM at all.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.020
I do think like LLMs could probably make these tests like even better.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:23.740
Or you know how I was saying a second ago, like in three months we could go take a code

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:28.460
base from like zero test coverage to maybe like 60%, 80%.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:33.260
I imagine if we made use of LLMs that would help make that happen.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:33.860
Yeah.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.300
Yeah.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.700
You could talk to it about like, well, these things aren't covered.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.020
Right.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.340
What can we do to cover them?

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:39.620
Yeah.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:44.820
I don't know if you maybe could do fully, fully automated, just push the button and

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:45.540
let it generate it.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.380
But you know, it could also be like a conversational, not a conversation, sort of a

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:53.780
guided, let's get the rest of the test, you know, like, okay, we're down to 80, we've

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.420
got 80%, but there's the last bit are a little tricky, like what ones are missing?

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:57.700
All right.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.300
So how do you think we could do this?

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.180
Is that about, no, no, you need to, that's not really the kind of data we're going to

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:02.460
pass.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.220
You know, I don't know.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.460
It seems something like that.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:04.660
Right.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.460
I really liked that.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:09.740
I had not thought about like a conversation as a way to generate tests, but that makes so

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:10.340
much sense.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:10.740
Right.

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:15.380
It kind of bring in the developer along with them where it's gotten too hard or something,

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:15.700
you know?

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:16.020
Yeah.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.900
There's something cool about just clicking a button and see how much code coverage you

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.020
could get to, but chatting to it.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:27.380
I think also, honestly, like so far, like our test generation logic is a bit of a black

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:27.900
box.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.260
It just kind of like works until the point where like it doesn't.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.060
So we're actually kind of in the, in the process of like shining a bit more of a light

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:40.900
into like, like essentially the like internal data model that Colo keeps track of to know

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:45.900
what the database state should be like in this arrange part of the integration test.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.780
And yeah, we're actually like in the process of like, yeah.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:54.780
Talking to a bunch of users who are already using it and also finding like companies who

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.100
want to increase their, increase their test coverage or who have problems with their

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:02.700
testing and want to improve that and kind of working closely with them to make that

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:03.060
happen.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.420
That's kind of a huge focus for us as we figure out like, how do we want to monetize

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:07.700
Colo?

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.540
Like so far Colo has just been kind of supported by SimplePool as a, as a side project,

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.300
but we're kind of making it real, making it its own business.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:18.060
So, and we think the test generation is going to play a big part in that.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:18.380
Right.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.620
Like that could be a, certainly a premium team feature sort of thing.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.260
Exactly.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:22.500
Yeah.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:22.820
Yeah.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.220
Yeah.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.020
Enterprise.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.460
Enterprise version comes with auto testing.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.180
Yeah, exactly.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:28.820
Something like that.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.060
Yeah.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.500
If there's anyone listening and like they're keen to increase their code coverage, please

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:32.900
email me.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.620
Maybe we can leave my email in the, in the notes or something like that.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:35.820
Yeah.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.540
I'll put your contact info in the show notes for sure.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.420
It's actually really nice.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.260
It's just w@colo.app.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.020
Oh, very nice.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:41.780
So yeah.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.500
If, if anyone's listening and wants to kind of like increase their code coverage or has a

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.860
lot of code bases that have zero coverage that would benefit from getting to like some

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.260
level of coverage, we'd love to help you and talk to you.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.220
Even if the solution doesn't like involve using Colo, just really, really keen to talk to

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.580
anyone about like Python tests and, and what can be done there.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.180
So yeah, please hit me up.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:01.620
Awesome.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.060
Yeah.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.060
I'll definitely put some details in the show notes for that.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.420
I have some questions as well.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:05.700
Please.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.180
Yes.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:06.660
Right here.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:12.500
I'm looking at the webpage and the, the angle bracket title is Colo for Django.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.700
But in the, the playground thing you sent me, it was on plain Python code.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.060
It was on algorithms.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.460
It was on pandas, which I thought was pretty interesting how much you could see inside

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:22.980
pandas.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.220
Makes me wonder, you know, if you look at the web frameworks, there's two or three more

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.860
that are pretty popular out there and they all support middleware.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.260
Yeah.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:30.900
A hundred percent.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:35.380
So Colo kind of started as like this, like side project for our Django app.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:37.780
And I think that that's why we kind of went there first.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.100
It's kind of the, the audience we know best.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.540
You do dog food as well.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:41.860
Yeah.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.340
Exactly.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:43.700
Dog fooded Lily.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:48.660
Who's, who's an engineer on the team is, and who's been building a lot of, yeah, a

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:53.020
lot of the Python side of Colo is like a core contributor to Django.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.420
So Django is like really where we're home.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.460
And to be honest, I think when building a new product, it's kind of nice to keep the

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:04.460
audience somewhat small initially keep like building for very specific needs as

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.460
opposed to going like very wide, very early.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.940
That was kind of very much, very much the intention, but there's no reason why Colo

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:16.340
can't support Flask, FastAPI, the scientific Python stack, as you can see in

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.860
the playground, it does totally work on, on plain Python.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.540
It's really just a matter of.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:26.420
Honestly, like FastAPI support would probably be like a 40 line config file in

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.460
it, exactly in like our code.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:33.700
And there's actually, yeah, we're thinking of ways to make that actually a bit more

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.820
pluggable as well.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.260
There's only like so many things we can reasonably support.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.540
Well, ourselves.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.740
I was going to say if somebody else out there has an open source project, they want it to

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.020
have good support for this, right?

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:44.940
Like, Hey, exactly.

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.100
Yeah.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:50.580
I run HTTPS or I run light star or whatever, and I want mine to look good here too.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:50.900
Right.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:51.620
Totally.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.460
So the thing you can do already today is there's a little bit of config you can pass

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:55.740
in.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:59.220
And actually, if you look back on the pandas example, you'll, you'll see this by

00:37:59.220 --> 00:37:59.700
default.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:04.260
Colo actually doesn't show you library code if you use it in your own code base, but you

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.980
can tell it, show me everything that happened, like literally everything.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:09.740
And then it will, it will do that for you.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:13.420
So in this example you're looking at, or if anyone's looking at the playground, if you

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.940
look at the pandas example, it'll say like include everything in pandas.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.380
And that'll give you like a lot more, a lot more context.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.420
The thinking there is that most people don't really need, like the issues you're going

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.060
to be looking at will be in your own code or you're in your own company's code base.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.180
You don't really need to look at the abstractions, but you totally can.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.860
But yeah, to answer the question, like we have this like internal version of a plugin

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:40.500
system where yeah, like anyone could add FastAPI support or like a great insight into

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.420
PyTorch or what have you.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:47.220
The way it all works technically really is it's totally built on top of this Python API

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.300
called set profile.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:48.940
I'm not sure.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.100
Have you used, have you come across this before?

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.820
It's a bit similar to set trace actually.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:53.900
Yeah, I think so.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:58.180
I think I've done it for some C profile things before.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.180
I'm not totally sure.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:38:59.660
Yeah.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:05.140
It's a really neat API to be honest, because Python calls back to your, like the callback

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.340
that you register on every function, enter and exit.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:12.660
And then Colo essentially looks at all of these functions, enters and exits and decides

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.780
which ones are interesting.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:19.100
So the matter of like supporting say FastAPI is basically just telling Colo these are

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.460
the FastAPI functions that are interesting.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:25.660
This is the FastAPI function for, for like an HTTP request that was served.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.220
This is the HTTP response.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:32.060
Or similarly for SQL alchemy, this is the function where the query was actually executed

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.220
and sent to the database.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.420
This is the variable which has the query result.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:40.340
Like there's a little bit more to it and I'm definitely like, yeah, generalizing, but

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.100
it's kind of like in principle, it's as simple as that.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:46.700
It's like telling Colo, here's the bits of code in a given library that are interesting.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:50.780
Now just kind of like display that and make that available for the, for the test generation.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.140
Excellent.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:51.340
Yeah.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:56.700
I totally agree with you that it getting focused, it probably gets you some more full

00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:01.020
attention from the Django audience and the Django audience is quite a large and

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.740
influential group in the Python web space.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.060
So that, that makes it totally, especially since you're using it.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:10.740
By the way, it was Lily's Mastodon profile, I believe that I ran across that I first

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:11.900
discovered Colo from.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.580
So of all the places, yeah.

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.420
Or a, a, a post or something like that.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.020
That's awesome.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:17.300
Cool.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:17.580
All right.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.100
So let's talk about a couple other things here.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:24.380
For people who haven't seen it yet, like you get quite a bit of information.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:29.980
So if you see like the get request, you actually see the JSON response that that

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:34.620
was returned out of that request and it integrates kind of into your editor

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.420
directly, right?

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.060
If you've seen code lens before, it's kind of like code lens, right?

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:38.300
Yeah.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.740
This is another thing which I think is, is pretty novel with, with Colo.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:46.300
Like I think it's reasonably common for existing debugging tools to show you like,

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.420
Oh yeah, this is the headers for the request, or this is like the response status

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:50.780
code.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:55.740
But especially working with the Slack API in simple poll, you're constantly looking

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:59.340
at payloads and what were the values for things and what are you returning.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:03.500
In production, you don't directly get to even make those or receive those requests,

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:03.700
right?

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.580
There's some like system in Slack who was like chatting with your thing.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.020
You're like, well, what is happening here?

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:09.380
Right.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.340
Not that you would actually run this in there, but you know.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.020
I mean, it's funny you mentioned this because there is one experiment we want to

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.700
run of kind of actually enabling these extremely deep and detailed Colo traces

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.540
in production.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:25.340
We haven't explored this too much yet, and I think we're going to focus a little bit

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:30.340
more on the test generation, but you could imagine like a user who's using, who's on

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:35.740
the talk Python side and they've, they've got some incredibly niche error that no one

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:40.260
else is, is like encountering and you've tried to reproduce it, but you can't

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:40.940
reproduce it.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:45.060
Maybe there's a little bit of information in like your logging system, but it's just

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:45.580
not enough.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.620
And you keep adding more logging and you keep adding more logging and it's just not

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:49.060
helping.

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:53.860
Like imagine a world where you can say just for that user, like enable Colo and

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.740
enable like these really deep traces.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:01.260
And then you can see whenever the user next interacts, like the value for every

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.980
single variable for every single code path that executed for that user.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.220
That's just like, yeah.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.300
I think one of our users described as like a debugger on steroids.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:09.660
Yeah.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:09.900
Yeah.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.940
It's pretty interesting.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:15.580
Sounds a little bit like, like what you get with Sentry and some of those things,

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.300
but maybe also a little bit different.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:23.740
So, you know, you could do something like, here's a dear user with problem.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:24.620
Here's a URL.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:28.820
If you click this, it'll set a cookie in your browser and then all subsequent

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.700
behavior, it just hits on it.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.220
You know what I mean?

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.140
It's like recording it.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:32.620
Yeah.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.700
That'd be pretty interesting.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:33.940
Yeah.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.540
I think it makes sense in the case.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:39.420
Like if a user, it could even be an automated support thing, right?

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.660
Like if a couple of sites have this where you can like do like a debug dump before

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.140
you submit your support ticket, this is almost like, like that.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:51.700
And then as an engineer who's tasked with digging into that user's bug, you don't

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.820
have to start with like piecing together.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.620
What was this variable at this time when they made that request three days ago?

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.180
You like, you can just see it.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:04.180
If an error ever encounters an exception on your site, you just set the cookie.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:04.460
Right.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.580
All everything else they do is now just recorded until you turn it off.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:08.220
Oh my God.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.580
You're giving me so many good ideas.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:10.180
That'd be fun.

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.340
I'm going to start writing this stuff down.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.220
Let's record it.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:13.700
It'll be fine.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:14.300
That's awesome.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:14.540
Yeah.

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.860
There's a bunch of stuff that's, that's, that's interesting.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:17.980
People can check it on the site.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.220
It's, it's all good.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.580
However, we talked a little bit about the production thing.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:26.140
Like another thing you could do for production, if this requires both a

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:30.300
decent amount of traffic and maybe, maybe you could actually pull this off on just a

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:35.580
single server, but you could do like, let's just run this for 1% of the traffic so that

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:39.460
you don't kill the system, but you get, you know, if that's why I see you have

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:43.900
enough traffic, it's like statistically significant sampling of what people do

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:48.220
without actually recording a million requests a day or something insane.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:48.980
A hundred percent.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.500
I think there's really something there, or like, I could go on about this whole

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.900
idea of like runtime data and like improving software understanding for days.

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.980
Because I just think like, it's really this like missing layer, right?

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:03.260
Like all of us constantly imagine like, what is like, we play computer looking at

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:07.460
our code, imagining what the values can be, but like, yeah, say you're looking at

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.860
some complex function in production and you want to understand how it works.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.940
Like how useful would it be if you could see like the 10, the last 10 times it was

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.780
called, like what, what were the values going into it and what were the values

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:18.420
coming out of it?

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:22.220
Like, that would be, I just think like, why do we not have this already?

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.420
Like, why does your editor not show you for every single function in the code base,

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.340
give examples of like how it's actually used like in production.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:30.620
Yeah.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.340
And then use those to generate unit tests.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.940
And if there's an error, use that to generate the edge case, like the negative

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.700
case, not the positive case unit test.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:37.900
Right.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.220
There you go.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:38.780
Exactly.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.500
It's all like kind of hanging together.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.260
Like, yeah.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.300
Yeah.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.220
Once you have the data, you have interesting options.

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:44.460
Yeah.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:45.180
Business model.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.300
This is not this, I maybe should have started sooner with this, but it's not

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.020
entirely open source that maybe a little, little bits and pieces of it, but in

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.780
general, it's not open source.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:55.380
That's correct.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:55.660
Yeah.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.420
No, I'm putting that out there as a negative, right?

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.340
This looks like a super powerful tool that people can use to write, write code

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.860
and that's fine.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:02.140
Yeah.

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.780
I think the open source question is super interesting.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:08.540
Like it's always been like something we've thought about or, or considered.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.420
I think there is, yeah, with, with developer tools, I think business

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.260
models are always super interesting and we want to make sure that we can have a

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:19.580
business model for Colo and like run it as like a sustainable thing, as opposed to

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:23.380
it just being like a simple poll side project kind of indefinitely be great.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:27.220
If Colo could like support itself and yeah, have a business model, I think that's how

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.900
it can like really fulfill its potential in a way, but that's not to say that like

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.500
Colo won't ever be open source.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.740
Like I think there's a lot to be said for open sourcing it.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:41.020
I think especially like the, the capturing of the traces is maybe something like I

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.580
could see us open sourcing.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.700
I think the open source community is fantastic.

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:48.300
I do also think it's not like a thing you get for free, right?

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:53.380
Like as soon as you say, Hey, we're open source, you open yourself up to

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.420
contributions, right.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:58.780
And to like the community actually getting involved and that's great, but it also

00:45:58.780 --> 00:45:59.700
takes time.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.980
And I think like that's a path I would like to go down when we're a little bit

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:08.660
clearer on like what Colo actually is and like where it's valuable.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:09.500
If that makes sense.

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.020
Yeah, sure.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:14.380
If it turns out that no one cares about like what, how, like how to visualize code,

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:20.340
then like, that's a great like learning for us to have made, but I'd rather get

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:24.500
there without like a lot of work in the middle that we could have kind of avoided

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:25.100
if that makes sense.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:29.900
So for sure, it feels like once we have a better sense of the shape of Colo and what

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:35.020
the business model actually looks like, then we can be a bit more, yeah, we can

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.700
invest into open source a little bit more.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:40.380
But to be honest, like based on how everything's looking right now, I would

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.420
not be surprised at all.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:46.180
If like big chunks, it's like Colo becomes open core or big chunks of it are like

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:46.980
open source.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:47.860
It makes sense to me.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.420
It is fully free at the moment.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:50.900
So I should, that's worth calling out.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:51.060
Yeah.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.540
There's no cost or anything.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:55.820
You can also like, you know, you download the Python package and guess what?

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.100
You can look at all of the code.

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.340
Like it actually is all of theirs.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.100
It is all kind of visible.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:06.300
That kind of leads into the next question is I've never used GitHub Copilot and a few

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:11.420
of those other things because it's like here, check this box to allow us to upload

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:15.660
all of your code and maybe your access keys and everything else that's interesting.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:19.220
So we can one, train our models and two, you know, give you some answers.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.260
And that just always felt a little bit off to me.

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.140
What's the story with the data?

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.700
At the moment, Colo is like entirely like a local product, right?

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.100
So it's all local.

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:33.340
Like you don't have to, you can get like all of the visualization, everything just

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.140
by using local Colo in, in VS Code.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:40.340
We do have a way to like upload traces and share them like with a colleague.

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:44.300
This is actually also something I think is like kind of playing with the idea of like

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.180
writing a little like Colo manifesto.

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.740
Like what are the things that we believe in?

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:52.380
One of them that I believe in, and this goes back to the whole like runtime layer on top

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:52.820
of code.

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:57.060
And like, there is this whole dimension, this like third dimension to code that we're

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.420
all simulating in our heads.

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:03.980
I think like it should totally be possible to not just like link to a snippet of code

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:09.380
like on GitHub, but it should be possible to have a like link, like a URL to a specific

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:13.540
execution of code, like a specific function and actually talk about that.

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.940
It's kind of wild to me that we don't have this at the moment.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.780
Like you can't send a link to a colleague saying, Hey, look at this execution.

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:21.780
That looks a bit weird.

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.620
We ran this in continuous integration and it crashed, but I understand.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:26.820
Let's look at the exact.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:27.340
Right.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.020
The whole deal.

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.700
You can link to like CI runs.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.380
You can link to like sentry errors, but like if you're just seeing something slightly weird

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:37.740
locally or like even something slightly like weird in production where there's no area,

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:40.020
you can't really like link, link to that.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:44.380
Anyway, like this is kind of a roundabout way of me saying that, like, I think that

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.540
totally should be a thing.

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.340
Like you should be able to link like generically to like a execution of a function or an

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.500
execution of a request.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:54.260
And like that would totally have to live somewhere.

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:54.460
Right.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:58.060
So this is where there's some idea of like colo cloud comes in and this is where you

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.020
could like connect your, your repository.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:05.300
And then Kolo would like, as part of that, you know, just like get help, does have

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.900
access to your code and like show you the code and in like the colo cloud.

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:13.620
So I think there's definitely like useful things that are possible there, but at the

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.740
moment it's a fully local experience.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:19.180
Like your, your code doesn't ever leave your, your system.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:24.900
You can, if you want to like upload traces and then Kolo stores the like trace data,

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.780
not, not the code, just the trace data.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.700
But yeah, very local experience right now.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:29.060
Yeah.

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.540
A little SQLite database.

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:30.980
Exactly.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:31.180
Yep.

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:31.420
Yeah.

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.380
SQLite's pretty awesome.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.100
It's a fightable piece of software.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.340
Yeah, it really, really is.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:39.980
Let's close out our conversation here with a little bit of a request from Michael.

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.620
Right now it's VS Code only.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:43.460
Any chance for some PyCharm in there?

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:45.980
This is our top request, like PyCharm support.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:46.220
Yeah.

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.780
And we've decided super small team, like we want to kind of support everyone, but

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:55.820
we've been working very heavily actually the past few months on a web-based version,

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.860
which is, I'm happy to say like very much nearing completion.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:02.900
And there's a few bits and pieces where like, it's really nice to be integrated

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:06.300
super deeply into the editor, like the code lenses and, and all of that.

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.340
And I think there's a chance we'll have that for PyCharm eventually as well.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:13.140
But we actually found that like building out this web version, there's a few things

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:17.420
that are actually much nicer when you have the full control over the UI in terms of

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.420
like browsing around a trace, highlighting little bits of code.

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:25.220
So for example, in Colo, like a given function call, we call a frame and you

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:29.540
can look at a given frame, both in VS Code, but also in the web version and see the

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.540
code and see all of the data that passed through the code.

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:36.580
But something we can do in the web version we can't do in VS Code is actually show

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:40.300
where the current function was called from and actually show like a preview of that

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:40.620
code.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:45.220
In VS Code, you can't really show like, you can layer multiple files together or

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:45.540
different.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.700
Yeah, exactly.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:46.980
Yeah.

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:50.980
There's actually a lot of, like, I was surprised by how many different novel,

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:56.260
like kind of ways we had in the web that we just never even considered with like a

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:59.340
direct editor integration in terms of displaying this runtime data.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:03.780
So like, long story short, like you, you know, want a PyCharm integration.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.180
Let me give you something even better.

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:05.740
Yeah.

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:06.540
Web version.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:12.700
So would that work like you run a certain command or something when you run your web

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:16.580
app and then it just generates the SQL lite file and then you could just explore it

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:17.900
with a web view or what are you?

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.660
Yeah, it's actually kind of cooler than that.

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:23.500
So if you're using Django or in the future, like other things with a typical

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:27.180
middleware, you would just like go to your, you would just go to localhost

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.820
8000/hello.

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:29.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:33.260
Kind of like you do for open API docs.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:33.500
Yep.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.140
And then the whole experience is just there.

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:39.900
If you're not using a middleware, we'll have a command like colo serve or something

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:40.340
like that.

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:41.700
And that'll yeah.

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.180
Host the same experience for you.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:48.700
Just make sure it's off by default or it only, it only responds on localhost or

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:49.540
something like that.

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.780
You know, like, yeah, exactly.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.580
Don't let people ship it on accident.

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:54.180
That would be bad news.

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.420
No production use of this.

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:55.820
Yeah.

00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:00.700
I mean, people already know about the Django debug settings, but right.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.460
I guess you could sort of layer onto that, right?

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:02.980
Probably.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:03.180
Yeah.

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.940
I think we actually do that at the moment.

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.940
But yeah, it's worth, worth remembering.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:10.380
No, I just think, you know, like, well, this is really cool.

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.420
It makes for a hundred percent.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.980
CNN.com is awesome.

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.740
Look what it's doing.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.860
Look at all these requests and all this.

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.220
Yeah, exactly.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.020
A hundred percent.

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.340
Yeah.

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:21.500
Oh, and the API key is so interesting.

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:25.780
Anyway, that's a bit of a side, a side conversation.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.300
So let's just, let's wrap it up with the final call to action.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:29.860
People are interested.

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:30.460
What do they do?

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:30.820
Yeah.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.380
Colo.app and check it out.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.740
We have a playground link there.

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:34.860
Play.colo.app.

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:39.140
Easiest way to kind of see what Colo is and what Colo does, but we'll say the

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:43.140
most powerful way to, to actually see Colo in action is to use it on your own

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:43.740
code base.

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:48.980
So seeing the visualization and the test generation capabilities is just like,

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:51.220
yeah, the most useful when you use it on your code base.

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.980
So hopefully the playground can entice that a little bit.

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:57.260
And yeah, really the main, most important thing for us right now is, yeah.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.060
Chatting to folks who want to increase their test coverage, want to like build

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.820
automated testing as part of their workflow.

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.300
And yeah, work very closely with you to make that happen.

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:09.980
So if that's you, please email me at w@colo.app.

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.100
You need that pause for the W that's right.

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.580
Or the two, the two at's.

00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:14.700
Awesome.

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.180
Will, thanks for being on the show.

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.380
Congrats on both of your projects.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:19.060
They look really neat.

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:19.780
Thanks so much for having me.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:20.060
Yeah.

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:21.060
So excited to have been on.

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:21.740
Yeah, you bet.

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:22.140
Bye.

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:22.500
Bye.

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:26.700
