00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.780
Are you early in your software dev or data science career?

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.960
Maybe it hasn't even really started yet and you're still in school.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.660
On this episode, we have Sydney Runkle, who has had a ton of success in the Python space

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.660
and she hasn't even graduated college yet.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.780
We sit down to talk to her about what she's done and might do differently again to achieve

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.620
that success.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.280
It's the Young Coders Blueprint to Success on episode 443 of Talk Python To Me.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.440
This episode was recorded November 8th, 2023.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:45.000

Sydney, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.020
It's awesome to have you here.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.440
Thanks.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.240
I'm excited to be here.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.080
Yeah, it's really cool to have you here.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.380
Lovely to have somebody who has a brand new experience in the whole software industry.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.980
And you've certainly found a lot of early success.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.080
So that's great.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.420
And you're here to share it with everyone.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.640
So happy to have you here.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.040
Yeah, I'm super excited to talk about it.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.240
Yeah.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.420
So, you know, we're going to talk about your experience.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.380
You're working on some pretty awesome projects.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.420
And as we were just talking before we hit record, you're still in college, still finishing up

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.420
your last year of college at Madison, which is excellent.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.740
So I think you'll be an inspiration and, you know, provide a lot of good tips for people

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.840
who are just getting into the software industry.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.360
All right.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.300
Well, before we get to that, though, tell people a quick bit about yourself.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.800
Who are you?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.780
Yeah, sure.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.560
So my name is Sydney, obviously.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.820
I'm currently a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.720
I'm studying computer science.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.480
I actually started off in both engineering and computer science, but decided that I loved computer

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.160
science enough that I just wanted to focus on that.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.400
Yeah.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.140
Why'd you switch?

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.980
What engineering discipline were you in?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.080
I was in electrical engineering, so there was a decent amount of crossover between the two.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.940
But I was just finding that I really liked my more advanced CS classes more than the advanced

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.840
engineering classes.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.320
Way long ago, I think the way you kind of got a computer science degree is you did an engineering,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.960
an electrical engineering degree.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.460
And you're like, oh, that has to do with electrons and circuitry.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.420
And that's computers, isn't it?

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.600
So the same thing, right?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.260
Now it's way more focused, right?

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.660
Like the software side of education, isn't it?

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.360
Yeah, definitely.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.720
And the nice thing is we still have some cross-listed classes.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.960
So I still get to kind of dip my toes in both sides.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.760
Yeah, excellent.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.080
Yeah.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.560
So I grew up in North Carolina originally in Chapel Hill.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.440
Really loved it, but for some reason decided to move up to where it's quite cold.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.020
And yeah, I've really enjoyed my time at Madison thus far.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.280
I think it's a great place to learn about CS.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.900
Well, I have some really good friends who were there for grad school at Madison and just loved it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.760
But I'm sure as we come into November that perhaps the weather's a little different than North Carolina,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.920
which is, you know, sometimes it gets chilly.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.620
Yeah.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.580
I'm getting some new like nice winter experiences, you know?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.360
Yes, of course.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.960
Of course.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.480
Cool.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.780
Well, let's set the stage a little bit by talking about what you're doing so people get a sense, right?

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.960
Like obviously Madison, for those who don't know, is a super highly respected school.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.140
So it's a pretty top tier computer science department there.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.520
That alone is pretty awesome.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.620
The fact you're about to graduate, it's pretty awesome.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.700
But you're also working on some cool open source slash funded, I guess.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.840
I don't know what the term for that is, like backed open source, but working with Pydantic.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.440
So yeah, talk a bit about what you're doing these days.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.760
Yeah.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.460
So I'm currently working part time at Pydantic.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.120
I know you've had Samuel and some others on the team on the show before,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.220
but I reached out to Samuel kind of later in the summer, actually, after I heard him talk on your podcast at PyCon

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.660
and asked if they were interested in having an intern, you know, help with some of the open source work.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.320
Because obviously they're delving into new commercial things now and Samuel got back to me.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.120
And so now I'm primarily working on open source there.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.120
I help with incoming issues and new feature requests, etc.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.780
We're currently working on the version 2.5 release, which has lots of new features and fixes, which is great.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.240
And it has certainly been the job where I've learned the most the fastest.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:52.020
I think being surrounded by other developers who have tons of open source experience makes such a collaborative and fast moving team.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.520
And so I've really enjoyed being able to learn so much and, you know, dive into this really well thought out and well developed code base and kind of go from there.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.000
That's awesome.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.600
Yeah.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.920
Samuel is a great guy.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.720
The Pydantic project.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.640
It's really taken the world by storm, wouldn't you say?

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.700
Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.660
Number of downloads per month, I think.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.320
Recently we hit over a million downloads per month.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.560
It's quite impressive and, you know, crazy given that it only started a couple of years ago.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.140
I think that I saw, I can't remember, was it an ex-Twitter post or was it a Mastodon post?

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:31.080
That Samuel had put up there that Pydantic had been, at this point, downloaded over a billion times, which is kind of unimaginable.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.480
Yeah.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.880
It's quite crazy.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.820
I haven't taken a math class super recently, but I know that it's quite a large number, so.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.100
That's right.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.240
It's definitely, definitely large.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.740
A lot of zeros.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:48.200
So I pulled up the GitHub page here for Pydantic, and it says the project is used by 270,000 other GitHub projects.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.760
Yeah.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.380
It's definitely quite ingrained in a lot of projects.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:02.300
Obviously, also used to support a lot of other popular open source projects, like the one that comes to mind immediately is FastAPI, which obviously many of the podcast listeners also know about.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.280
But it's exciting that it's able to serve as such a consistent foundational block for so many other libraries.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.520
Yeah, it really is.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.140
The podcast website's based on Beanie, which is, you know, MongoDB plus Pydantic.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.540
And I was literally just working on some FastAPI code.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.040
I'm like, oh, I got to put this away.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.620
Got to do the podcast with Sydney.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.760
So yeah, it's definitely, definitely something that's pretty wild.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:32.140
I don't know about how you feel about this, but does it make you a little bit nervous to work on a project that affects so many people?

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.240
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.380
I think starting off, I thought I would feel a bit more nervous.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.160
But once I kind of got into the swing of things, I think we have a really great code review system there.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:47.760
So, you know, I feel supported, even though if I'm, you know, making changes that seem kind of new or different to me, I feel like we have a great team.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.400
And not only just the team at Pydantic, but obviously other open source contributors that can get feedback, etc.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.460
And it's nice to be able to rely on them for feedback before, obviously, we release two.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.240
Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.440
Yeah, they're right below the number.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.280
The used by count is the contributors.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.580
And there's 447, at least directly to Pydantic.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.020
And I don't know the Pydantic one.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.440
Maybe there's a Pydantic core that's a separate repo these days.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.880
There used to be one thing, but then the whole VTube was about splitting that up, right?

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.180
Yep.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.840
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.620
So we have a core written in Rust that handles a lot of the validation and serialization logic now.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.860
Yeah, yeah, very cool.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.760
So you're about to graduate.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.580
You talked about jumping into this project and learning so much.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.780
I had a really similar experience when I was in grad school.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.880
I was studying math, but then I got to work on some actual software projects.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.220
And they were desktop apps.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.440
Can you believe it back then?

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.660
Really, really fun projects, though.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.200
And I had the same experience.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.900
Like, wow, I've learned so much here.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.540
And, you know, I did less computer science in college because I studied math and computer science minor.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:59.900
But still, my interactions with my computer science side of those courses, I felt there were a little bit – I mean, I guess you should be this way.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.500
They felt a little academic being at the university.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:08.000
And a little bit not entirely in touch with, like, what's the latest way of writing code?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.400
What's the latest technologies?

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.580
What's the latest open source?

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.060
Or what's the latest tools?

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.020
You know, it's been a long time, let's say.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.840
A couple years since that was – since I did that in the, you know, mid-90s.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.040
Yeah.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.280
You totally changed.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.060
What's your experience?

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:21.720
Is it similar?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.560
Yeah.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.360
How has this new project kind of gave you a lot of exposure?

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:24.860
Yeah.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:36.280
I would say my experience has been quite similar kind of with the juxtaposition of standards in my computer science classes and more academic applications of computer science versus in my various internships.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:48.240
I think that's been one of the most valuable things about seeking out, you know, diverse opportunities outside of class is really being able to get experience with, you know, like version control systems and continuous deployment systems.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.580
And how do I work on a code review?

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.120
How do I, you know, interpret a code review?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.760
Things like that.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.500
And then beyond that, just modern coding standards and current libraries, et cetera.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:11.540
So I definitely do think there is a gap, but I do think there's still a lot of value in, you know, some of the fundamental concepts that are, you know, language agnostic or just, you know, easier to learn in a classroom and aren't quite as dependent on, like, code quality and production quality, et cetera.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:18.120
But I think it's also really important to get the experience outside of class that gives a lot more feedback as to like, is this good code?

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.880
Is this bad code?

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.200
Et cetera.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.140
Because that's certainly not something that's really emphasized in class.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:31.340
Even if they try, I think one thing that's super hard to simulate is working on a team where stuff is used by other people and there are consequences.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.940
You know, it's one thing to say, well, we're going to pretend to do a PR and how'd that go for you?

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.180
Yeah.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.820
It's another to say, we're going to take down 270,000 projects if we get this wrong.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.420
So the continuous integration should probably be working, right?

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:43.740
Yep.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.300
Definitely.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.720
What languages has your courses mostly been in?

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:55.380
So our kind of foundational computer science courses, you know, learning about data structures, et cetera, are in Java.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:01.340
There are a couple of kind of like on-ramp courses that you can take in Python if you've never really learned code before.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.280
Obviously, that's a little bit easier to get started with.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.380
And then I've taken some courses in C as well that are architecture related, et cetera.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:15.100
And now that I'm kind of past the intro, past the computer architecture and into the elective focus classes, we've kind of pivoted back to Python.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.980
I think part of that is I'm taking a lot of more data science, machine learning focus classes.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.660
And so obviously Python's a pretty convenient language to write up those things.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.300
That's pretty much the de facto on there for sure.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.200
Yeah.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:35.300
When I took the couple of computer science classes that I did or programming classes, it was a little bit out of sync with what I was wanting to do.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.600
So when I was, I also started out in engineering.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.400
I'm like, maybe I'll switch to something else.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.120
But before I did, they said, well, you're going to need to take a programming class.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.180
I'm like, oh, that sounds awesome.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.580
They're like, yeah, we got to have Fortran 77 class.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.580
I'm like, are you serious?

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.020
This is the most important class you're ever going to take.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.400
Don't skip on it.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.800
I'm like, maybe I'm not so sure about that.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.660
Then I said, then I wanted to take another course.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.560
I'm like, maybe I'll take a C++ course.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.040
They're like, great.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.700
But first you got to take a Lisp course.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.900
I'm like, really?

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.640
Can I just like take something that modern software is built with, please?

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.020
Nope, nope, nope.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.600
But yeah, yeah, very fun.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.820
Quite the journey though, it sounds like.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.200
Knowing Java is a good skill.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.620
It's kind of a different paradigm for how code executes.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.800
It's the same for C, right?

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.140
Yep.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.440
Yeah, I definitely think it was helpful.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.520
I think at the time in class, I was like, man, I really love Python.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.800
You know, why can't we be writing Python?

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.560
But definitely great to get exposure to different languages.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.200
And I think it helps to better understand general patterns in programming, et cetera, if

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.720
you have to implement that and see the different implementations in different languages.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.800
Yeah, for sure.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.940
Python with its types is getting a little bit more like Java, but hopefully not too

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.620
much like Java.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.960
So, excellent.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.700
All right.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.380
So, you mentioned that you're doing a lot of Java.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.080
Quick audience question out there.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.480
Arjun says, I'm an IT professional.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.000
I've not had any experience in any coding.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.760
What's the best way to start with Python?

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.040
I initially, a few years ago, started learning Java, but kind of lost interest.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.840
What are your thoughts?

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.680
That's a great question.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:09.300
Honestly, I started by reading a how to write Python book and kind of pivoted from that

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.460
to online courses.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.620
I think my number one recommendation would be online courses.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.840
I know you guys at Talk Python have some awesome online courses that people can take.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.660
And before, I think in like middle school and high school, I took some courses through edX

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.160
and Udemy.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.480
And I think that's a great way to get started because you can kind of have the balance of

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.400
I'm writing code.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.880
I'm seeing other people write code.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.820
You know, often there's like auto graded questions involved.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.840
And the nice thing about an online course is that it's asynchronous, right?

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.660
So you can do things when it fits into your own time.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.740
And another nice thing is that there's a pretty large community of people online who love to

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.520
write Python and are getting started writing Python.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.080
And so I think there's also a lot of support there, which is great.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.360
Yeah, there's definitely more resources now than there ever have been, right?

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:51.700
Yeah.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.120
Yeah.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.200
I agree with online courses.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.740
I really, really like the focus.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.060
You know, when I started doing online courses that we have, one of the things I wanted to

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.440
do is try to go like, how do people who might otherwise take a semester long course at say

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.280
a community college?

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.820
Because if you're in a full on university, you probably have a program you're following.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.240
But if you're just like, I'm just going to take a course.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:11.460
Yeah.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:16.520
How do you take that and change that from 16 weeks to five hours, you know, and still get

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.980
something meaningful out of it?

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:24.900
Since this is kind of focused at young people and not, we're talking like, you know, 20s type

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:30.580
of young person, but just, you know, if people come along like, but what about my middle school

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.560
or something?

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.060
Are you familiar with this project, Code Combat?

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:35.980
Have you seen this?

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.440
Yeah.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:36.520
Yeah.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.840
I used it in middle school.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.340
Did you?

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.080
Amazing.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.140
What a cool way to write code.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.400
Tell people what it is.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.260
What are your thoughts since you actually used it?

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.440
There are a lot of sites like this that basically allow you to write code with, you know, some

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.740
pretty significant guidance and support to, you know, move along characters and games and help

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.500
in this case, like fight other characters with your code.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.080
And, you know, I can think of other examples.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.240
Like I worked on a like robot program where I was helping a robot Carol, like, you know,

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.900
walk around a maze and things like that.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:09.920
And so I think websites like Code Combat or Codecademy or even Code.org have a lot of really

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.460
great opportunities, especially geared towards younger people who might need help writing code

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.060
for the first time.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.760
It can't like just jump right into the deep end with one of the more complex courses on like

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.000
Udemy, for example, offers a lot of more like collegiate level things.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.700
But I think these sites are particularly great and entertaining.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.940
You know, it makes you feel like you're playing a game, but you're also learning in the background,

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.520
which is great.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.220
Yeah, this is such a neat game.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:36.360
They've got these different worlds or whatever, and they each have maybe this one here, Cloud

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.900
Drip Mountain has 110 programming puzzles.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:44.660
And the reason I really when people ask sometimes I recommend this one is a lot of these things

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.700
that are like for really true younger people are really just true beginners.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.860
They hide so much of the code.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.540
They're like, well, if we could just teach the concept of loops, you know, and then you

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.780
just drag a circle around this thing and then you click this block in.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.260
You know, I think that still is a pretty big gap.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:04.480
But this is you write real Python with an editor, but the little editor is like the world's most

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.320
aggressive autocomplete you've ever seen.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:06.820
Right.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.800
You type the letter E, H, you know, like hero dot attack.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.760
And like, what should you type in here?

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.660
You know, it's like, whoa, OK.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.180
But yeah, I think this is this is really awesome for young, young people.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.040
But, you know, I think even maybe older people might just if they want to kind of play an

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.600
online game.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:21.840
Right.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.440
If you're sitting around, you're like, oh, maybe I'll play Candy Crush or something like

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.340
I'd rather play Code Combat than that, you know?

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:27.640
Yeah.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.380
It's definitely great to have the additional engagement there.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.740
And, you know, if it's just like write this for loop to do whatever that's not even close

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.740
to as engaging as like, you know, the enemy or things like that.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.500
Yeah, exactly.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.120
Exactly.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.740
Cool.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.900
So there's a whole spectrum of online resources there.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:43.420
All right.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.160
How about we jump into some of the tips, some of the things as well?

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.360
Oh, before we do one thing, I think you kind of hinted at that with your answer here, your

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:51.880
response there.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.860
How much programming experience did you have when you got to Madison?

00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:01.300
Because I think one of the challenges is while maybe the principle of computer science is

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.400
you could show up with zero coding experience and they're like, this is a keyboard.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:05.900
Awesome.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.120
And we're going to start with that.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.420
A lot of people don't.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.560
And so you might be sitting next to somebody like, oh, we're both working on their project.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.600
How are you done?

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.900
Like, well, I've been coding for, you know, however long, right?

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.700
What was your experience going in?

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:22.500
Yeah, I would say for a college freshman that I did have quite a bit of experience.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.200
I had, you know, done all these code combat-esque things in middle school.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.720
And then I was lucky enough that my high school offered some coding classes, even at the AP

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.320
level, so more advanced courses.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.820
So I'd taken those.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.700
And then especially-

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.700
Probably more Java, right?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.960
That's what AP seems to be a lot of.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.820
I actually took one in Python, but I think that there was definitely another one in Java.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.200
And then, especially during the pandemic, I did start to get about antsy.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.220
And I was like, man, I really want to be, you know, working and applying this.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.840
So I started having computer science internships in high school.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.080
So I think definitely coming in, I was a bit more prepared for some of the classes, especially

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.280
my first Java class.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.980
I'd never written Java before, but I at least understood, you know, some of the paradigms that

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.620
were helpful.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.820
And I do think it's helpful to come in with some experience because like you said, if you come

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.160
in with none, it's a little bit hard to just jump into a college level course.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:11.960
Yeah, for sure.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.760
You can do it.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.640
Not saying you can't do it.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.280
But I guess the thing is, you know, if you look around the class, you're like, there's

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.660
some people that are really good at this.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.300
Like maybe that probably is true, but it also could be that there's some people that have

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.660
a lot of experience and you're brand new.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.640
And we all know that the first bit of code that you write is always a bit of a got to

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.900
get your mind into it sort of thing.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.640
Yeah, definitely.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.820
And I think the good news is, too, you know, if you take one quick course, like even introduce

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.320
yourself for five to 10 hours, like that's going to be a really big benefit.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.500
So it doesn't take a ton of work to just get over that initial, you know, learning curve.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.960
Yeah, that's a super good point.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.740
I remember when I was learning C++, I was so psyched that I got it to compile.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.600
And then I learned about runtime bugs and how much harder they are.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.600
I'm like, oh, this is worse.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.420
This is way worse.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:54.960
All right.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.380
So all right.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.400
Let's jump into the tips.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.880
So tip number one, you have work on open source contributions.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.140
Tell us about this.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.680
I can't say that during my first couple of years of programming experience that I did

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:06.940
this.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.840
It was really only more recently as like this past summer.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.040
But I think, you know, getting involved in the open source community can be really beneficial,

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.940
especially in terms of like seeing other well-written code and, you know, standards in the industry.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.820
And I think, you know, another thing I want to mention here is that like open source contributions

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.640
seem a little bit intimidating at first, right?

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.980
It's like, oh, my gosh, here's this huge project that has been worked on for years.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.840
I don't know where to start.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.020
But like even minor documentation updates are super helpful.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.940
You know, we're just writing an example in the docs or writing an extra test, things like

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:37.240
that.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:42.280
And so I think even just those little like micro contributions can really help you get involved

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:42.820
in that community.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.240
And then also just learning more about the tools you're using day to day anyways.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.340
Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.440
And many projects are very welcoming.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.980
People who want to raise their hand to get involved, right?

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.440
Absolutely.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.520
I mean, you know, filtering on the good first issue tag is always a good way to start.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.280
We're trying to, you know, mark more and more of those at Pydantic just because there are

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.520
certainly a lot of people that want to help.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.720
And we more than welcome their assistance.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.960
It's really great to see, you know, first time contributors popping up every day.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.260
So for people who maybe are listening and they're thinking about just getting into this, right?

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.820
But I'm labeled good first issue, right?

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:21.880
So if you go to the issues, you can actually see which things have been labeled as, look, you

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.680
don't need to understand a whole bunch about this system to get started.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.080
So that's a really good way to kind of see what's already out there.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.700
Because I think you might look at a project, I want to help, but how?

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.720
Like, what do they need help with?

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.080
Like, well, here's a whole list of small steps that people, somebody could raise their hand

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.700
and help with, right?

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.160
Exactly.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:38.420
Yeah.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.320
It's a great, when you have this huge project, it's like, oh no, where do I even start?

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.240
And then searching by that tag is a great way to just jump in and filter, especially,

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.640
you know, on large projects, like we currently have about 400 issues, right?

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.680
So it's nice to have that filter there.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.360
Honestly, I'm pretty impressed that there's only 400 issues.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.360
Yeah.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:54.720
You know?

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.300
Trying to keep it clean, we'll see.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.220
It's not easy, is it?

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:02.580
Definitely a lot coming in, a lot coming in after every release, but it's great to, you know,

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.060
see so many people engaging and interested in new features and helping report and fix bugs,

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:07.580
you know?

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:07.880
Yeah.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.200
Yeah.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.920
And I'm looking here and one of these, just open once, but it's numbered 8,058.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:19.160
So, you know, that's a whole bunch of closed or deleted, ignored issues, but somebody had

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.360
to deal with them along the way, yeah?

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.280
Yeah, certainly.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.240
And I think another great thing about working on open source contributions, especially if

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.380
you don't have a ton of experience with software development, you know, maybe you're a student

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.440
and you've worked a lot with computer science concepts, is it's a great way to practice your

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.100
version control skills, right?

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.220
Like you're going to need to make commits, you're going to need to submit a pull request and get

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.040
that reviewed and iterate with other developers.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.740
And so it's an awesome way to just pick a project and develop those skills kind of in

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.160
parallel with your actual coding skills as well.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.020
Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.780
And also get a sense of what does releasing and testing software feel like, because probably

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.820
got a PR, then the PR has got to run some continuous integration.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.060
And then, you know, which branch does it go into?

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:06.100
All those sort of things that we were talking about before that make it hard to simulate in

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.460
school, like you throw it in the somewhat deep end, but you know, it's good, good learning.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.160
Yep, definitely.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.140
And there's a lot of documentation to help with.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.280
How do I make my first commit?

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.540
How do I pull this code down, etc., which is good.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:16.800
Yeah.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.680
I also think the tutorials and the documentation side could be really helpful.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:26.340
I was working on some project and it had documentation for the, you know, whatever

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.960
property function, whatever it was that I was working with.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.060
So kind of enumeration.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.280
And it was like split segments.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:37.080
And then you look at it, the documentation says, this setting this to true will split the

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:37.360
segments.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.180
Like, okay, what does it base the splitting on?

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.020
Like, what does this even do?

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.880
Like, okay, I understand they will be split, but I would need to be more precise.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.120
Right.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.480
And like, just if you look at it, it kind of has just the name turned into a sentence.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.000
Like, you know, that thing is ripe for getting a little bit of extra detail, I would say.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.800
Yeah, definitely.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.140
You know, if you're confused, I'm sure someone else is confused and always great to at least,

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.720
you know, report or help fix that, etc.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.140
Yeah.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:09.160
The other thing I like about your first tip here is you make connections in the industry

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.720
pretty quickly, right?

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.020
Like, jumping into Pydanic, you get to know Samuel Colvin, who's connected to all these other

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.300
people.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.880
And you probably work with Sebastian Ramirez from FastAPI because those two projects work

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.780
closely together, right?

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.280
And all of a sudden, people are like, oh, yeah, that guy's amazing.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.320
I wish I could meet him, right?

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.360
You know, you're working, you know, virtually side by side, right?

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:32.140
Yeah, it's really great and, you know, awesome to have such a community that's focused on like

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.080
helping other projects.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.820
And obviously, it's just, you know, general improvement of projects for public use, which

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.180
is a really great motive.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.800
And as you mentioned, like any contribution that you're going to make is going to get you

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.820
noticed and help you make connections, which is great when you're, for example, a student

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:50.440
like me looking to, you know, like make connections in the computer science and software community

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.320
and maybe look for jobs eventually, etc.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.040
Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:58.620
And if people show up, you know, you go to a job interview and there's 10, 20 applicants

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.260
and they're like, okay, look, we work with FastAPI.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.900
Have you, are you familiar with it?

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.160
Somebody says, no, I think I've heard of it.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.600
Is that, is that a Python framework?

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.800
Yes, it's a Python framework.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.100
Okay.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.340
Then the next person is like, yeah, I've written a little demo app with it.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.440
And then, you know, you show up and you're like, yeah, I actually contributed and added

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.840
this feature that I hired.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.980
You know what I mean?

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.100
You know, a lot of people focus on what is your kind of GitHub profile look like?

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.880
What kind of projects do you have, etc.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.220
And, you know, if you're like, man, I don't have the time to develop all these awesome projects

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:32.320
on my own, but you know how I can boost my profiles, just work on other people's, other

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.680
people's projects, help out, etc.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.040
Right.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.700
And then, you know, someday you'll probably come up with something that catches on and you'll

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.480
have your own project.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.760
But, you know, when you're really new, it's kind of hard to, those things are not easy to

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.580
make a popular project in the first place.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.240
And so you can really jumpstart that whole process.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.140
Yep, definitely.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:49.440
All right.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.660
Related to this, and you kind of hinted that it is the next tip is reading other people's

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:53.900
code.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.240
Yeah.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.000
As we discussed at the beginning of the podcast, sometimes the code that you might write in class,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.540
you perhaps are a little bit more focused on, you know, getting it to work than how clean

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.040
is this?

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.660
How maintainable is this?

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.640
How well would it work with other systems?

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.580
So I think reading other people's code, especially often through, you know, open source contributions

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.720
can be really beneficial in just helping you understand what are the industry norms?

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.500
How can I improve my own code so that I'm, you know, matching these?

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.040
And another great kind of tie in with the open source contributions is if I write some code

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:29.440
to fix a bug and then get reviews from the, you know, maintainers of a repository, like I'm

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.440
getting immediate feedback about like, how am I doing in my, you know, patterns that I'm using

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.820
and the ways that I'm refactoring things, et cetera.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:40.060
And I think that's one of the best ways to learn the most quickly is, you know, you already

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:44.660
had to come up with a solution to implement this fix yourself, but then let me collaborate

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.840
with other people who are really experienced in this field to get a better idea of what

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.740
I, how I should be solving problems like this.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.020
Sure.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:57.500
And when you learn through a tutorial or online course, or even a college course, there's

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.260
really different kind of expectations about how the code runs.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.160
A lot of times it's like, oh, okay.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.700
So if I type this in and I do this loop and I do this thing, then it'll work.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.520
But what about the error handling?

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.800
What about the robustness, right?

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:15.620
Like those things are my experience when I was working with interns more quite a while

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.500
ago, but it was like, we'd have a project project would be going along great.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.700
And they'd write awesome code, but I'd say, okay, see where you're supposed to put that

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.620
number, type the word seven in there and see what happens, you know?

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.440
And then poof, the program dies.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.980
You're like, okay, we still got a little more work to do.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.120
Like, how about an error message?

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.820
Like this has to be a number rather than just killing the program.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:40.620
Those kinds of things you learn by working on like real projects, like open source ones,

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:40.960
I think.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.120
Also, you know, you get to better understand for a given language.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.820
Obviously, I'm most familiar with Python.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.700
Like, where should I be writing documentation for my code?

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.320
You know, where should I be putting my examples?

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.640
Where should I put my tests?

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.080
And things like that, you don't necessarily have to think about if you're just writing a

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.760
script, you know, for a class or, you know, online or in person, whatever that might

00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:58.980
be.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.780
Talk Python To Me is partially supported by our training courses.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:08.720
When you need to learn something new, whether it's foundational Python or advanced topics

William out there says, when wanting to contribute to a project, I tend to fall down the try to

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.600
understand everything rabbit hole.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.160
Any tips on balancing contributing and learning by reading code?

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.300
Yeah, that's a great question.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.520
I definitely fell down that rabbit hole myself.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.480
You know, I'm like, okay, I'm going to fix this one line in this function.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.240
And then I'm like, oh, I just read 500 lines of code in the spot.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:54.860
I think a good thing is to focus specifically on like one issue, right?

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.460
Like find one bug or one fix that needs to be made and just kind of constrain yourself

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.300
to like, let me fix this one thing.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.280
And then if you're like, oh, I have extra time, then go ahead and read the rest.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.540
But I think obviously, to your point, like you do have to contextualize some to be able

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.960
to understand an issue or a bug better.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.960
But I suppose the nice thing is the more you read, the better.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.280
It ends up being the long term.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:15.660
Yeah.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:20.400
Person, I kind of feel like try to understand programs and stuff like vertical slideshow.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.740
through like all the tiers and parts of it.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.840
Like how much of this database bit do I need to understand to make this part work?

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.400
I don't want to try to understand all the stored procedures and this weird optimization.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.700
I just need to know, how do I get this thing so that I can do this feature?

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.980
And you kind of slowly explore your way through.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:41.400
But, you know, you can sort of do those things more quickly than trying to like, okay, first,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.220
we're going to read everything.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:42.520
Right.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.380
Give me a week.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:43.680
Yeah.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.240
And I think another thing that helps sometimes that helps keep me focused is, okay, let me,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.520
you know, create something that's going to reproduce this problem.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:55.560
And then let me step through a debugger so that I'm at least letting myself know where

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.780
like this data, you know, is coming from or where this problem is coming from.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.360
But I don't necessarily have to understand like every function that things move through

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.060
or every class.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.880
But I'm at least like getting that kind of higher level understanding of like, where the

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.920
heck is this thing coming from?

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.400
And then I can really focus more on, you know, where is the issue that needs to be fixed?

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.900
And let me really take a look at those couple of lines of code.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:19.740
Another thing you get from reading other people's code is an appreciation of style, right?

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:25.360
Like formatting and polish and presentation, because a lot of good code, and a lot of times

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:30.140
this is open source code, is written to be read more than it's meant to be written, right?

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:30.560
Definitely.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.060
We like our automatic formatters a lot at Pydantic.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:40.480
So we just implemented the new Ruff formatter, which is written in Rust super fast and adheres

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.860
to I think it's like 99.9% compatible with black, which is great.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.260
And then before that, we were using black for everything.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:52.280
So another benefit of those contributions is getting used to using code formatters, you

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.320
know, once you're done writing your code.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.680
And now I find myself, you know, just creating an environment and using code formatters for

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.480
my academic code anyways, because I can't stand the look of it if it doesn't, you know, match.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:02.740
Yeah.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.120
The professors must love you.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.860
They're like, oh, this is so nice.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.760
I can read it compared to like whatever.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.960
So this other one that got submitted.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.340
Yeah.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:17.300
I switched over to using rough for all of my projects as well and ran rough against like

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.320
tens of thousands of lines of Python and Ruff format.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.620
And it was like, you hit enter and it's just done.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.580
It's like reformatted, you know, 392 Python files.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.500
And like, did it really do it that quick?

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:28.880
Yes.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.040
Sebastian was quoted as saying like, you know, sometimes I purposely introduce little

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:36.920
bugs or, you know, well formatted things in my code just to make sure it's working.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.700
And it is, but I just wanted to make sure because it's so darn fast.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.500
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:46.520
I integrated it into PyCharm and there's a way now with the plugin to say when you do reformat

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:50.040
code in PyCharm just run Ruff format, which is really cool.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.640
And so now you just, you know, hit the keystroke to reformat and it's just, you go, and you're

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:53.940
like, okay.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.100
And so it's all good to go.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:55.500
Very nice.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:55.800
Awesome.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.340
I know what I'll be doing after this call then.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.780
Alyssa says, I'm a TA for a college intro Python course.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.080
What advice would you have for students getting into Python for the first time in college level?

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.000
You know, what to focus their time on and so on.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.140
Yeah, that's a great question.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:14.160
And I think kind of the fundamental data structures can be really helpful to focus on at first

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.980
and kind of fundamental concepts to programming like for loops, while loops, functions, classes,

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:19.500
et cetera.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:25.020
And one nice thing about Python is that, you know, it's relatively easy to read code that's

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.180
written with those structures, right?

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.720
Like it's a little bit more intuitive than other languages like C, for example.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.680
And so I think getting started with those basics is nice in Python because if you just look

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.540
at, you know, someone's example code, who's implemented that, you can kind of read it like

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.280
English if it's written well enough.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.700
Good names for variables and functions and that kind of stuff, right?

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.580
Yeah, definitely.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.500
And I think too, kind of like we mentioned at the beginning, if you kind of find a fun,

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.640
easy project that can help to contextualize and make your work more exciting, right?

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.820
If it's not just, okay, let me, you know, think through these 10 concepts that I need to

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:01.840
learn, but like, oh, let me write a rock, paper, scissors function or things like that.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.140
Yeah.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:07.920
One thing I'd also throw in there to add is maybe get them started with good tools really

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.900
soon, right?

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:14.720
Like PyCharm or VS Code, something like that, like rather than just notepad or some random

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.300
thing, like, look, these tools will really, really help you.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.440
They'll like help auto format it.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.140
They'll like do the formatting for you.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:25.700
They'll give you advice and show you the errors before you even run it, you know, like send

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.620
them on the right path with that.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.560
Yeah, that's a great tip.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.120
I think it makes everything feel a little bit less overwhelming, right?

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.060
It's like, okay, this, this is going to do half my work for me.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.520
And then I just need to do some of the thinking.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.220
Exactly.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.080
And it's got my back.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.640
I think, you know, if you say like, okay, you type the if statement, then you hit colon,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.040
then you go and you hit four spaces.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.700
You're like, what?

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.080
I got to press space four times.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.820
This is, but if you just say I type colon, I hit enter, then I keep typing and it's like

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.780
auto indented, right?

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.040
It's already done what I need.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.260
Then like, oh, okay, this is actually, it sounds weird, but it's actually totally fine.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.060
Yeah, definitely.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:59.040
So your next piece of advice here is to join some kind of club, computer science club or

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.140
something at your school to get going.

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:01.500
Yeah.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.720
Like I mentioned, I was really fortunate in high school to have, you know, a teacher that

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.860
taught some CS courses.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.300
And I even helped lead like the coding club at my school.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.200
And I think this is a really great opportunity to engage with other students who are interested

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:15.620
in coding.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.880
Even if you don't have coding courses, you can, you know, all kind of get together once a week

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.940
even, or once every two weeks and just work on projects or learn together in the club that

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.780
I was leading week sort of did a combination of little lessons and then also, you know, working

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.720
on projects together.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.480
And then sometimes we would do little competitions.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.040
You know, there are things like LeetCode and other websites like that, that allow you to

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.480
practice your algorithm skills.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.540
And not only are you getting better with coding, but it also helps to connect with other coders

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.060
in your community.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.360
I think obviously by the nature of the work, sometimes it can feel a little bit lonely.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.880
And so it's nice to connect like that.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:55.420
And if you're not in school, but still looking to engage there, you know, Python meetups and

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.940
other like data meetups.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.820
And yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.940
I don't know why I chose this location, but yeah, I just threw Python.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.980
I told it near you, but it actually put it in Verizon, New York, wherever there's, there's

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.520
tons and tons of these places, right?

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.460
And evening of Python coding, Python and APIs, Python 100 days of code.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.840
There's just tons of options, right?

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.780
Because when you're in school, there's usually like clubs either in high school or in college

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:20.840
or maybe even more.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.540
But once you graduate, then you're like, well, go back to high school.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.080
That'd be weird.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:25.380
Yeah.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:32.180
But these, these meetups and also, you know, PyCon just got announced for Pittsburgh and

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.540
PyCon is such a major experience, I think for a lot of people.

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:35.860
Yeah.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.780
Looking in from the outside, I feel like people, a lot of people were like, well, I was really

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.700
intimidated to go.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:43.580
And really it's just like the programming party and everyone's so welcoming and you should

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.220
really check it out.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.640
I think for, for people listening.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.180
I'm excited.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.900
I'm going to go for the first time in next year.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.120
Yeah.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:49.480
Yeah.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:49.840
Awesome.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.280
Yeah.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:50.740
I love PyCon.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.100
Always, always tons of fun.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.500
What's our next tip here?

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.420
Reach out to local companies for job opportunities.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:01.220
You talked about your internships and I was going to ask you about like, how did you find

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.620
them so soon?

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.280
But I knew a tip was coming.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.340
So save it for now.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.280
Like this is a great, great piece of advice.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:07.620
Yeah.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:13.180
So I think sometimes getting a, you know, your first job in a computer science field can,

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.380
or, you know, software development field can feel a little bit intimidating, especially

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.680
when you're on the younger side, right?

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.900
It's like, oh, well, all these people that I see working at thing companies are, you know,

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.140
older and have degrees and are more experienced, but, you know, there are a lot of people

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:29.800
a lot of small computer science startups or even medium sized companies that are more

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.600
than happy to hire younger high school interns.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:38.440
And so my first ever like computer science experience was a company that was in Chapel Hill,

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.140
Carrboro, where I grew up called QuantWorks.

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.580
And I worked for them for two summers in a row.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.180
And it was really great just to start to get working with other people.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:52.200
We did some work for a local nonprofit group and then worked on an API with COVID information.

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:57.720
And, you know, even those, these weren't like huge projects you'd hear about at, you know,

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.640
Google or things like that.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.560
It was really great to just get those like local experiences.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:06.400
And I think also it's a little bit easier to, you know, get ins at smaller companies, right?

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:12.500
Like if I, as a 15 year old email someone at Google, like, you know, who knows about me hearing a response,

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:18.040
but, you know, local companies, I think it's just a lot easier to connect and start growing your career roots there.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:18.320
Yeah.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.120
Here's the big secret that you don't learn until you kind of walk the path.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:27.660
I think if you get one of those jobs at the amazing thing companies or some big tech company,

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.600
you're probably going to be doing something really focused and specific.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.060
You won't get a real broad chance to work on software.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:39.260
But if you get a job at a small company, you know, you kind of got to do a lot of stuff because,

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.960
well, it's maybe you and the one other person, right?

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.440
So I think it helps you grow a little bit quicker.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.020
Yeah, I completely agree.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:53.620
I've been really grateful to have had kind of all my job experiences be at smaller companies

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.440
at the next company that I worked at.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.820
It was an insurance tech company.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:04.760
I got to, you know, work on an API client and on even some like marketing videos for our company.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.960
And then, you know, got my first exposure to like cloud infrastructure, which like you're saying,

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.860
like those aren't, those combinations of things aren't something you'd get to do at,

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.440
you know, a large company internship.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.040
So I think that's one of the benefits of...

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.280
Yeah, there's teams for each one of those things you just said.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:19.560
Right.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.960
And then sub teams and then sub sub teams.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.320
Yep.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.040
Yes, exactly.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.540
And it's easier, like you said, it's easier to get those jobs.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.740
So it'd be cool to get a job at Google or Microsoft or whatever.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.160
But seriously, look around.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:35.660
There's probably a lot more opportunity at, you know, small groups that really need some

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.340
computer help.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:36.840
You know what I mean?

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.220
Yeah.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:41.120
And the benefits of looking local is like, you might already have a connection there that

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.540
you didn't know about or like that.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.860
So it's always helpful.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.400
Next up, next tip, learn about software design principles.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:47.980
Yeah.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.780
So this kind of ties nicely into our previous tip.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:55.520
But, you know, the earlier you get to start working on some sort of production system or

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.720
even just, you know, an open source project that has releases, et cetera, the earlier you

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.840
get to start learning about how do I integrate and deploy this?

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:07.860
And how do I work with pipelines and why are all my tests failing, you know, and things

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.280
like that.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:14.080
And I think having those skills going into other opportunities really makes employers excited,

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:14.400
right?

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.620
Because you're already experienced in things like that.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.300
And so they don't have to spend, you know, the first couple of weeks getting you used to

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:24.660
their integration and deployment systems and contributing to the repository and pull requests

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.460
and things like that.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.120
And even things like agile development strategies.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.300
So getting used to like, how do I plan out what I'm going to develop in the next two

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:32.600
weeks?

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.880
You know, obviously there are various different systems you can use for that.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:41.180
But I think just taking things one step further from I know how to write the code to like, how

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.340
do I write the code with a team?

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:48.820
And how do I, you know, make sure it's released consistently and reliably, et cetera, can be really

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.260
beneficial.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.700
I mean, to the team, circling back just really quickly, like both to the contributing to open

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.320
source and the joining a club.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.720
I think when you, a lot of people first think about programming, they think about, you know,

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.160
okay, well, I'm going to go into the basement and shut the blinds and not see anyone and

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.600
just write code and become pale.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:09.400
And, you know, but a lot of software actually is a pretty social, pretty interactive experience.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.840
And I think you get both of those from open source and internships and the clubs as well.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.580
Yep, definitely.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.340
And it's more fun.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:15.900
Come on.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.460
Certainly.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:16.920
Yeah.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.340
Speaking of fun, find an opportunity to teach code.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:19.700
Yeah.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:24.080
So this one, I think is a little bit harder to orchestrate, but obviously there are always

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.280
people wanting to learn how to code and people of all ages learning, wanting to learn how to

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:29.500
code.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.200
So kind of my own experience was this with this was in high school.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.580
My school was promoting this class for anyone of all ages.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.600
It was going to happen, you know, from seven to 9pm once a week.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.080
And we were going to teach Apple Swift.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.180
So the like app development programming language.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:49.200
And I had only, you know, learned it for a couple of weeks, but they were looking for volunteers

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:49.860
to help teach.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:54.300
And, you know, it's similar to think our viewer, Alyssa mentioned she's a TA, right?

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:59.240
And I think the more you teach something, the more you are able to, you know, convince yourself

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.500
that you understand it, really grasp concepts.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:05.300
And so I think if you get an opportunity to teach, you know, even if it's just volunteering

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:09.840
or if it's paid, it's really beneficial in helping you understand those concepts.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.140
And I think just sparking kind of a general love for the community, right?

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:16.400
Like when you get to help others learn, it's really positive experience.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.560
Yeah, it is pretty amazing.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.920
And it doesn't have to be a full on college course.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.200
It could be, you know, we talked about the meetups or clubs, like, hey, I'm going to volunteer

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.960
to do a presentation at one of the local meetups.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.220
Yeah.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.780
People are pretty supportive and it's pretty, pretty low key.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.220
I know some of the ones I've been to will be like, well, we're going to have three presenters

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.880
and they're each, you know, 20 minutes instead of one person who has to be up there

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.880
in front for like a really long time.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.360
And, you know, 20 minute presentation on something that you're kind of passionate about.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.180
It's pretty easy once you, if you, if you're worried, you know, once you get over being

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.660
nervous, it's pretty easy.

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:49.020
Definitely.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.880
And, you know, it's like, okay, what code did you write last week?

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.480
And what tool did you find really helpful?

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.900
Like, it's pretty easy to talk about that in front of other people who are also going

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.600
to be really excited to learn about it.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:58.620
Yeah.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:58.780
Yeah.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.200
I thought this would be easy.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:00.900
It was really hard.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.560
Here's what I did.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.840
Like, here's how we made it, like got through and what actually unlocked it.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.020
And like that kind of stuff is really fun to talk about and super helpful.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:08.340
Yeah.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.540
What are your other pieces of advice?

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:14.360
I think it's kind of leans into the internship side of things, but, you know, connect with

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.480
nonprofits and see if you can help with any of their needs.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.820
We've talked a lot about community on this podcast, right?

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.420
I think the more you involve with open source projects and, you know, work at a company,

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:27.320
you start to realize, okay, this like really is a welcoming and engaged community and kind

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.880
of taking that outside of the sphere of just computer science.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.880
Obviously, nonprofits really help to do great things for communities.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:38.700
And often they have some pretty significant tech needs that are hard to meet.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:43.320
And so I think another really great opportunity for young people who aren't maybe necessarily

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:48.220
ready to start like a full-time job or even part-time job is just, can I work for a couple

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:51.060
of hours a week with this, you know, nonprofit to help them?

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.340
That might be, can I help them maintain their website?

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:57.920
Or can I build them a spreadsheet that has a couple of automations that's really going to

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:58.440
help them?

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.940
So like one example is that in Chapel Hill, where I'm from, we have this great nonprofit

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:07.960
called Porch that helps collect food from neighbors' porches and then redistributes that

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.300
to local families in need and food pantries.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.520
And you can imagine once you start to hear about this organization and it spreads, there's

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.480
a lot of people involved.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.180
And so I helped my first internship kind of build a tool for them just to like organize

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.720
their routes for pickups and things like that.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.020
And so it doesn't even have to be as complicated as that, but just, I think reaching out to nonprofits

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.000
is a great way to not only feel like, great, I have a coding community, but also like I

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.920
have a place in my broader community as a whole.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.160
Yeah.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.860
And also offer some nice, nice ways to give back.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:40.540
If you're working on a project where you, you know, maybe you're enjoying writing the code,

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.120
but you're not like, well, how much am I contributing?

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:47.280
Like I'm trying to, you know, optimize the trading speed for this algorithm.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.480
Like that's cool and all, but I kind of want to just feel like I'm, I'm using some of my

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.380
powers for good.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.600
You know, one of these things comes to mind is just a thing called the humanitarian toolbox.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.620
And it's a whole bunch of different pieces of software to help.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:05.820
Like when there's earthquakes or other national, you know, tsunami type disasters and, you know,

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.260
helping humanitarian organizations solve technology problems with open source.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:09.540
Right.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.060
Things like that is just, that's pretty cool.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:11.420
Yeah.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:11.680
Yeah.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.340
Yeah.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:15.220
So people can, I mean, there's just one that I know of.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:18.640
You can search around and find, I'm sure there's many of these projects.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.160
And if there's not, you know, you could create one, like the project you just talked about,

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:22.400
right?

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.140
Yeah, definitely.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.060
The, it's exciting that the need is always there.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.140
And so if you just find a project that sparks interest in you, like go ahead and contribute.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:29.900
Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.680
All right.

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.720
What do we got next here?

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.080
Sign up for a couple of newsletters.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:34.400
Yeah.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.180
So this is a pretty like easy and passive way to get better at things.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.960
But, you know, if you just sign up for a couple of newsletters, I know,

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.180
like real Python has a great one that just sends out little tidbits and tricks and,

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.240
you know, best practices.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:51.960
And then kind of a more career focused one is Ryan Peterman has a newsletter about just

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.160
kind of advancing through a software development oriented career.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.220
You know, when you're sitting on the bus or ready to go to bed and just want to take a

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.720
little read of something, it's nice to just spend, you know, two to five minutes reading

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.440
little hints and tips and tricks.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.980
And this is a nice thing for people who are quite busy and still looking to improve, but don't

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:13.400
have a ton of time to, you know, add an additional course or teach a class or go to a meetup,

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.040
things like that.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:14.800
Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:19.020
Another tip you have is take online courses because they're pretty short, right?

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.380
Yeah.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:24.480
I kind of mentioned that already, but I honestly, another benefit that I found of that is just

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.240
really helping me feel more comfortable in class.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:32.760
You know, if I started taking, I think my first like machine learning course when I

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.620
was in eighth or ninth grade.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.540
And obviously I did not understand a lot of what was going on in the course, but at least

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:42.580
I pulled, you know, maybe 20% out of the course and got to move forward with that.

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:46.560
And so I think just the earlier you get to have exposure to things that you find cool, the easier

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.280
it's going to be to learn down the line.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.040
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.160
Another tip you have is learn more than one language, which you're kind of forced to do in

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:57.320
computer science programs, but it's, it's easy to just go like, well, I've chose which

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.640
one I'm going to learn on my own.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.800
And then I just did that.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.040
Right.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:00.760
Yeah, definitely.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.620
I think, you know, especially with Python, a lot of people who get started with maybe a

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:07.900
more data science oriented trajectory are like, okay, this is all I need.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.540
I've got everything right here, you know?

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:13.900
And I think it just makes you a better programmer to have exposure to different languages.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:18.340
And, you know, maybe you don't have a ton of time to study three at once, but like

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:21.480
go read, you know, some code from a different language.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:26.020
And I'm kind of experiencing that right now, getting used to writing some code in Pydantic

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:30.880
core, which is in Rust and then being a little bit more familiar with the Pydantic Python wrapper,

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.140
but it's really refreshing and great to learn about new ways to solve problems.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.940
And, you know, obviously Rust is quite impressive and fast.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.320
So that's always exciting too.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:39.660
Yeah.

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.440
You can tell that Python's getting older over 30 years now because there's a lot of Rust in

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:43.600
it.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.540
Yeah, exactly.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:48.820
No, it's, it really is impressive how much it's gone from, oh, we're just doing everything

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:53.580
in C extensions to like all the fancy shiny stuff is Rust internal somewhere.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:54.020
Yep.

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:54.320
Right.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:54.600
Yeah.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.720
You've already talked about multiple tools that are in libraries that are that way.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.040
Right.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.820
And we use Py03, which is an awesome library that kind of helps to connect Python to Rust.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:06.440
And, you know, there are more and more open source contributions to projects like that,

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.940
that help link languages, which is awesome.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:09.180
Yeah.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:14.380
So one sort of sub tip that you had in here is this get 1% better every day.

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.580
And you'd sort of group that into the newsletters.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:20.740
I think that can go kind of shared amongst many of your pieces of advice.

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.120
Yeah.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.520
I think it's a great mindset to have in general, you know, as long as you're putting in relatively

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.000
consistent work to learn and practice what you're learning, et cetera.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.100
I think you'll be quite surprised and impressed with yourself at how much better you're getting,

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.160
how much more comfortable you feel with things.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.740
And I feel like when you're just starting out and you've got this huge learning curve to

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:43.720
work on, it's really great to, you know, just be consistent, like for five to 30 minutes a day,

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.200
like work on this thing.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.700
And then even in two weeks, you're going to be like, wow, I've learned so much, you know,

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.700
and then you can imagine what you'll feel like in a year.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:50.960
Yeah.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:56.340
I think it's so easy to underestimate that, how that compounds in your career.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:01.220
I remember when I first got my first real programming job, I was still in grad school,

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.660
but working on it a lot and you would get, you know, officially,

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.960
you've got an hour for lunch, but the way it really worked, we'd go grab some food and,

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.120
you know, eat it quick in the little courtyard and then go back to work.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.760
And, just cause where else are you going to go?

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:20.620
You know, but what I started doing was I would get some new programming book, book on

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:23.920
refactoring or design patterns, or I was doing C++ at the time.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.120
So some C++ book.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.380
And I would just say, look, I get an hour.

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.160
I got 25 minutes before I go back to work.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.280
I'm going to just sit here and read the book every day.

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.260
And just one, I felt like I was supposed to have an hour from my job for lunch.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.600
And two, it was contributing back to my work anyway.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:41.960
But it was after doing that for a year or two, I went from being like a super newbie to giving

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.720
conference talks to people like, wow, how'd you learn all this stuff?

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.540
I was like, well, lunch basically.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.620
You know?

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:47.960
Totally.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:52.040
And I mean, kind of connecting back to this podcast over the summer, I started listening,

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.980
you know, I was like, well, I have a 15 minute walk to work each way.

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.860
I might as well learn something while I'm at it.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.980
And I'm a big fan of podcasts anyways, but, you know, I'd finished my New York Times daily

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:01.440
by then.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.280
And I was like, well, I've got to listen to something else.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.560
So it's great to just, you know, we have so much downtime during our days when we could

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.400
be listening to something.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.980
But listening to this podcast is another great way to just pick up tips and learn about what's

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.240
going on in the Python community.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.740
And, you know, how can I write my own code better?

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.400
Things like that.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.120
Yeah, I really appreciate that.

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:18.500
And thanks.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.080
I find there's a lot of people who will write me.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:24.520
And when I first started this podcast, I thought, well, who's going to listen to such a show?

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.700
Like, must be the people like really, really into it, right?

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:31.320
And then I started getting emails from people who would say, hey, I really enjoy your show.

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.960
I'm starting to understand a lot of the things you're saying.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.500
I'm like, I've been listening for six weeks.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:35.900
I'm like, why?

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.140
You listen for six weeks and you like barely understand?

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.780
Like, well, okay, thank you.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.260
But why do you do this?

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:45.540
And what I realized is a lot of people who are new start to use it as a language immersion.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.820
You know, like if you wanted to learn Portuguese, you just go live in Brazil for six months and

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:50.600
then you would know it, right?

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.000
And so they kind of like, well, I want to be in the Python space.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.200
So I'm just going to like immerse myself in that space until it starts to click.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.200
Yeah, it's a good way to do it.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:03.220
And like for the job that I had this previous summer, I was working in the Django framework.

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:07.120
And, you know, obviously when you're on the job and writing code and you have a problem,

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:10.260
it's pretty easy to just look something up and read through documentation, et cetera.

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:14.140
But then I kind of started searching through your previous podcast and just listening to

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.520
episodes about Django because it was like, okay, what can I, you know, pick up that I don't

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.460
necessarily need like right now to solve my problem, but can really help me down the line

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.240
and just kind of in my day-to-day writing code.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:24.600
Awesome.

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.900
I think we might have touched on pretty much all of the tips.

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:28.040
Yeah.

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.880
I guess the last one is part-time freelance work.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:36.440
So one angle was get an internship and so on, but maybe you live in a place where it's

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.460
hard, it's hard to find a remote internship or something like that, right?

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.780
You could do some like lightweight consulting type of work.

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:43.460
Yeah, exactly.

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:48.200
I'm certainly more interested in backend or like full stack kind of thing, but there are

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.080
a lot of people who are looking for, you know, website help and website development.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:57.320
So I've kind of reached out on platforms like next door, which is just like a neighborhood

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:02.100
communication platform and, you know, through school email lists and things like that and

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.660
said, Hey, does anyone need help, you know, building a website?

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.140
And honestly, I do most things through Wix.

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:10.500
So it's not like it takes a ton of technical knowledge.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.940
Like I didn't need to study these things for years and years to be able to practice them.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:18.200
But there are a lot of people looking for just help with technical things.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.720
And if you, you know, have little bits of time here and there, but can't commit to,

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.980
you know, a full internship or full-time job or anything like that, it's a great way to

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.440
just get started writing code.

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.640
And people are always, you know, super grateful just to have the tech help.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.500
Yeah.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.500
It's a good way for you to get experience out there.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.140
All right.

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:39.280
I'll throw one in here to maybe around close things out is volunteer at conferences.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.940
So we talked about going to conferences or going and joining meetups, but you could volunteer

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.660
at a conference or at a meetup.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.800
And a lot of these conferences like PyCon, there's hundreds of volunteers, many, many

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.220
volunteers.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:53.280
I think it probably is over a hundred volunteers to make that happen.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.640
And I think there might even be sometimes like travel grants.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.600
Like if, hey, if I volunteer to basically work at the conference, will you, you know, get

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.660
me there sort of thing.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:06.720
And much like working open source, it really lets you make connections with people in the

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.380
industry, right?

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.300
With the speakers and other folks.

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:09.460
Yeah.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.320
Yeah, definitely.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.360
I think that's a really great piece of advice.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.780
You know, I think a lot of these are very applicable to like, even if you don't have

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:19.020
a ton of experience, you can get started with this, you know, and it can kind of be your

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.820
on-ramp into this community if that's what you're interested in.

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.360
And I think that's a really great one, right?

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.380
Because not only are you going to get to be in this community, but also like no better

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.580
place to learn about Python than PyCon, right?

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:34.400
So yeah, just be in that space and get to absorb that, all that information as well.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:34.680
Yeah.

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:38.540
And people might not know, they hear about PyCon, they're like, okay, that's the one, that's

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.180
the big one in the US and it moves around.

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:44.920
And then there's EuroPython, which is in amazing places in Europe, but there's actually many,

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:52.160
many miniature PyCons around, you know, there's like PyOhio and there's PyTennessee and PyTexas

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.540
and PyCascades and I was at PyBay in San Francisco a little while ago.

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.020
There's a bunch of volunteers there.

00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:01.260
So it could be that there's one hour drive from where you are.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.880
You don't have to make it a big trip.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.620
Yep, definitely.

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:07.880
And, you know, more and more, there are also some like online opportunities, right?

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.840
So if you really aren't close to any that are coming up soon, you can also consider that

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.080
route.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:12.720
Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.480
All right.

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.800
Well, I think that pretty much wraps it up.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.780
Anything that we didn't cover that you think you want to throw out for people getting into

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:21.380
programming and Python?

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:26.400
So I think we did a pretty comprehensive overview, but I think the exciting thing is just if you

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:30.740
want to learn more, there are a ton of avenues to do it and a really supportive community kind

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:31.720
of waiting for you to help.

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:32.000
Yeah.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.260
I think if you haven't experienced it before, I do think the how supportive the community

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.740
is and how welcoming they are is probably going to be a surprise.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.740
A lot of people like you think, oh, I don't know enough.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:43.720
They're going to call me and say, you don't know how to work at this project.

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.340
Get out of here.

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:50.000
Like, no, usually they're everyone's super excited to whatever, have you speak at their event,

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.840
volunteer, work on the open source project, you name it, right?

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.080
That's been my experience anyway.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.160
Yeah, mine as well.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:55.540
Excellent.

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:56.280
All right.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:01.900
Well, before we get out of here, I usually ask a question at the end about some PyPI project

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:03.920
or a library that you've run across that are awesome.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:08.220
I mean, we can go and throw out Pydantic and Pydantic Core for everyone out there because

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:09.120
that's amazing, right?

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.380
But anything else that you're like, wow, this is really awesome.

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.200
People should know about.

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:17.040
Yeah, I guess I mentioned it a little bit earlier in the podcast, but the company Astral

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.040
has been working on the Ruff project.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:23.600
So they originally had a linter and the code for that is written in Rust.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.540
So it's quite fast, as we discussed before.

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:32.400
But they just came out with their Ruff format support and lots of major projects have switched

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:32.860
over to that.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.700
So FastAPI, Pydantic, et cetera.

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:39.020
And I think it's really great to see, you know, people still working super hard on high

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.260
performance formatting and linting tools.

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:45.760
And it's just really quite satisfying to see things run so fast and keep things so clean.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.940
So I guess give a shout out to that project.

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:48.940
It's quite helpful.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:49.340
Yeah.

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.020
Charlie Marsh and the team over there are doing excellent work.

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.120
And it's really great.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.880
I think I like the way that it works.

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:59.780
And obviously, black is kind of the de facto things that people are choosing.

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.160
So I like the ways in which it's the same as black.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.660
I like the ways in which it's different and configurable as well.

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:06.380
So I can definitely second that one.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.340
That's a really good one.

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:10.880
Yeah, the number of configuration options that they offer are really great.

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:15.620
It's quite impressive that they have the, you know, 99.9% compatibility with black.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:19.080
That makes it super easy to adopt given the already existing standard.

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.500
But also nice that they have really well-documented differences and things like that.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:24.120
Yeah, for sure.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.500
All right, Sydney, thank you so much for being on the show.

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.160
And I can tell that you're going to be super successful.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.760
You already are super successful.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:35.600
And, you know, you're months away, a good number of months, but months away from graduating

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.000
and really diving headfirst into this.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.440
So you must be pretty excited.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.660
And yeah, congrats.

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:41.320
Yeah, thank you.

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.460
It was so wonderful to chat with you on the podcast.

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.740
And hopefully I'll see you at PyCon this next year.

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:46.480
Yeah, you as well.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:46.980
Hope so.

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:47.320
Bye.
