WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.580
So you're excited about that next app you're about to build.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.180
You can visualize the APIs with smooth scalability talking to the mobile apps.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.740
You can see, finally, this time, you'll get deployment right,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.260
and it'll be pure continuous delivery out of GitHub with zero downtime.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.500
What you're probably not dreaming about is writing yet another password reset form

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.760
and integrating the mail capabilities just to send those reset emails,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.900
or how you'll securely store user accounts the right way this time.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.240
Don't worry, we got you covered.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.480
Our guests, Christos Mascas and John Patrick Dendison,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.360
are here to cover a bunch of different libraries and techniques

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.680
we can use for adding identity to our Python applications.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.920
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 292, recorded Friday, October 2nd, 2020.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.240
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.200
and the personalities.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.000
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.140
Follow me on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy, and keep up with the show and listen to past

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.040
episodes at talkpython.fm, and follow the show on Twitter via at Talk Python.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.960
This episode is brought to you by Linode and Talk Python Training.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.260
Please check out the offers during their segments.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.560
It really helps support the show.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.660
Here's an unexpected question for you.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.760
Are you a C Sharp or .NET developer getting into Python?

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.760
Do you work at a company that used to be a Microsoft shop, but is now finding their way over to the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.380
Python space?

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.660
We built a Python course tailor-made for you and your team.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.000
It's called Python for the .NET developer.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.360
This 10-hour course takes all the features of C Sharp and .NET that you think you couldn't

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.920
live without.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.540
Unity Framework, Lambda Expressions, ASP.NET, and so on.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.220
And it teaches you the Python equivalent for each and every one of those.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.080
This is definitely the fastest and clearest path from C Sharp to Python.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.560

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.260
Christos, John, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.160
It's nice to be here.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.980
Thanks for having us.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.580
Yeah, it's great to have you guys here.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.140
We're going to talk about identity at all the different levels.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.940
And I think that's something we really haven't covered that deeply on the show, not in a

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.020
standalone sense anyway.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.200
And so I'm looking forward to covering these topics because we've got some interesting

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.000
and strong opinions about different things that we're going to cover.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.060
And it's going to be a lot of fun.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.880
I can tell already.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.940
Hey, we're open.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.220
We're open to all and every opinion here, right?

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.960
We just want to make sure that people are doing it safely and right if they're building

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.460
apps, right?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.000
So that's our goal.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.640
That's right.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.200
Yeah.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.040
So let's start with the beginning, with setting stage, just personally for you two.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.820
Christos, I guess we'll start with you first.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.140
How did you get into programming?

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.500
And then how do you find your way over to being interested in Python, at least as part of one

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.380
of the languages you write?

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.140
That is correct.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.020
So it's funny because I was thinking back how I started with programming.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.080
And I was saying yesterday that I actually want to be a hacker.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.400
At some point in my life, the crossroads of what do I want to do?

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.300
I think it was the tender age of 20 or 21.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.120
I was like, what do I want to do with my life?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.440
I can choose anything I want.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.280
I want to be a hacker.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.760
So I was like, to be a hacker, you need to know how to write code.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.960
So I was like, okay, I'll go and get a degree in coding.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.740
So I did a software engineering degree.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.380
And then I thought, you know what?

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.540
If you want to be a good hacker, you need to know about networking.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.780
So I went and did a networking degree, understanding TCP, stacks, OSI, and what have you.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.020
And then I went back to programming because I fell in love with it initially.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.700
I became a .NET fanboy from the early days because I did that in uni.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.960
And then the market was ripe for that.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.620
So I ended working with that stack for very long.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.020
So since 2004, I've been writing code in .NET.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.140
But over the years, I worked as a consultant.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.380
So I got a chance to double with Python, Node, Java.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.000
And that Polyglot experience brought some interesting bits like, oh, I like this bit from Node.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.260
I like this bit from Python.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.120
.NET doesn't do everything.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.700
Then .NET Core came around.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.760
So I fell in love with .NET Core again and pulled me back into the .NET ecosystem.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.580
And then I joined Microsoft in 2016, working as a consultant, helping customers.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.140
And since March, I moved into the identity team where I work as a program manager for the developer advocacy team.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:31.080
And this gives me the opportunity to actually go and play around with all the languages and see how we can integrate identity into these things securely and with scale.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.400
And that's where we are today.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400
Yeah, it's super cool.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:42.260
And I think one of the things that's really interesting, this whole evangelism side is you get to touch a bunch of different technologies and identity.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.760
You get to talk about a bunch of different technologies.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.740
This Node app wants to talk to that Python API back in.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.120
Yeah.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.060
So you really kind of got to embrace that full time, right?

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.980
And every platform and every language.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.140
So we're not locked into a specific ecosystem.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.900
We can speak to AWS developers.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.420
We speak to Google developers.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.780
We speak to DigitalOcean developers, as we mentioned before.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.800
For us, it's about making sure that you have the right tools in your arsenal to write the code using the tools that you love and the languages that you love.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.140
All right.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.960
I can't let you get off this topic here of the origin story without asking you about Mr. Robot.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.940
Oh, God.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.520
I love it.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.160
My background right now on my Windows terminal is Mr. Robot.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.860
Oh, my gosh.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.760
As is Mr. JP's, who's going to be talking in a second.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.600
And the other background, because I have multiple terminals, the other one is Halt and Catch Fire, which is my second favorite TV show.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.640
If you haven't watched it, it's a fantastic TV show.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.340
Oh, yeah.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.960
I would say Mr. Robot, if those of you who have not watched this, it gets a little weird in season two and season three.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:53.760
But season one, this is, I would say, it's probably the absolute best dramatic representation of programming and software in a show.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.620
It's not one of these fake things.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.200
Like, you really feel like, I think there's a whole section where they're using PyCharm to write some Python code down.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.200
Yeah.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.520
And you're like, dude, that's legit code on the screen.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.600
That's not like weird green text falling down or something, right?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.500
Actually, it's super accurate.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:16.160
And there are lots of people in the tech industry that love that show that spend time looking at the commands that they write to analyze whether it's a valid code or not.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.460
Whereas other shows, I don't know.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.120
I mean, the best one was NCIS, was it?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.820
Where two people jump on the keyboard?

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.380
Yeah.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.540
Was that the VBA one?

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.200
The VB one?

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.740
Yeah.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.180
The very first one where they were like, oh, somebody is attacking us.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.720
And the two people jump on the keyboard trying to type at the same time on the same keyboard.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.560
Oh, that hurts.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.940
That's not the pair program we were thinking of.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.560
All right, John, how about you?

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.440
How did you get into programming, VBA?

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.160
So I started, I was always sort of into computers and building stuff when I was a kid.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.500
And so I thought, oh, I'll go to college for something I want to do, which is music education.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.600
So I wanted to be a band director.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.100
So we see, which we see how well that worked out.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.100
So I went to college and I took a bunch of programming classes.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:02.020
And most of my programming classes were actually in Python when I was starting out before they moved into Java.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.440
I'm super jealous.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.080
They said I had to do it all in Lisp and 4chan.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.160
What?

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.420
Oh, God.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.140
Yeah, no thanks.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.940
Yeah.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.320
All right.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.660
So yeah.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.840
All right.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.860
Python and then Java.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.400
That makes sense.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.720
I mean, I think honestly, studying a static language is super important, even if you don't necessarily embrace it.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.760
But Java, C++, C Sharp, you should know that stuff, even if you don't necessarily do it day to day.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:24.960
Yeah.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.460
Yeah.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.880
And then while I was in college, I found a job on a help desk and one of their developers left and they said, hey, do you want to come help and take over?

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.080
And I said, I guess.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.740
I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'll try.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.580
And so my first project, for better or for worse, was an online banking app that was written in C Sharp.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.560
And I was like, are you guys sure you want me to build this?

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.340
I was like 20.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.900
That's so interesting.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.400
I remember the first time I wrote a credit card processing, I was paranoid.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.340
I had a hard time being relaxed.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.860
I'm like, what if I get it wrong?

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.040
What if I charge them $10,000 instead of $100?

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.640
Because I thought it took cents and it took dollars.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.840
It was really nerve-wracking.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.820
And that's a hard first project.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.880
When it was me and one other guy, and he had a lot of – he was a 15-, 20-year guy.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.340
But I would ask him questions and he was just like, yeah, no, it sounds fine.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.320
I thought, you seem very relaxed about this whole thing.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:21.880
And it was an app for high net worth individuals to go and manage their insurance accounts.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:28.460
So I guess there weren't like transactions necessarily happening, but you could reinvest your life insurance policy and stuff.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.780
I mean, I was terrified every day I went to work.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.380
And this guy, we hired a guy, a consultant to come in and help.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.300
And my boss said, well, you're 20, so you're not going to get your own office.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.920
And he's a consultant and he's not going to get his own office.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.460
So you two are going to share an office.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.840
And so I sat at a desk with a tower of Mountain Dew cans in between me and him.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:55.040
And he would poke out once a day and he'd go up and write a concept on the board like, you need to go learn about interfaces and C-sharp.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:55.920
And I said, okay.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.900
And I'd go figure it out and learn about them and come back a couple days later and say, okay.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.200
But it was really interesting.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.860
It was sort of a trial by fire.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.860
And then I started working, you know, doing enterprise dev at different places.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.820
And then I got really into Azure about 10 years ago and built an app with a friend.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:19.040
I told Christos, I don't know if you can still call it a startup when it's nine years old, but I guess it's still a startup because it makes about as much money as a startup.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.200
I was actually thinking about that just the other day.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.240
I saw headlines like, when does a startup stop becoming a startup?

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.960
It's odd that that label, like it's applied to it.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.180
I feel like people almost consider Facebook and these types of places a startup.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.560
Like this is not a startup.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:40.580
So let me just ask you, my theory is basically when you stop accepting VC money, it's not a startup.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:49.400
And maybe it might not be a startup when, even when it's small, if it doesn't have like some of these attributes, like high growth, sort of user growth.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.200
Overprofit or profitability.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:10:01.300
I feel like there's some sort of metric you can say, like this world makes these attributes make it a startup, not just a small business or a large business.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:01.700
I don't know.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.140
What do you think?

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:02.420
Yeah.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:08.420
Well, by that definition, let's see, growth over profit, VC money.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.840
So we've had none of those things.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.540
Exactly.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:17.000
But I think we called it, we used to call it a startup because it was only two of us and it was technology focused.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.740
It was all about, it was actually, it was a proxy.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.140
Yeah.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.220
I think it qualifies.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.340
Sorry for the diversion.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:21.720
Keep going.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.600
No, no, that's okay.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.840
But I learned a whole lot.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.180
I learned a whole lot because I was building software outside of work.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:34.300
And it was, I think for me, when we had people start paying to use it, it was sort of like the light bulb went off of like, hey, maybe I should, like, maybe this is it.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.900
Maybe I do have some talent here and I should do this more often.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.360
Yeah.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.660
It's kind of like an external validation, which was cool.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.040
And started doing cloud consulting for people too.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:50.040
So I worked for a consulting firm and we would go to customers that wanted to use Azure or were interested in it and say, hey, this is how you use it.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.640
And these are ways to get started.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.660
And here's how you design apps that are going to scale to one node or 5,000 nodes.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:02.260
And a lot of patterns and how do you deal with consistency and data and that sort of thing in a cloud environment.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.820
Of course, back then, it was the Wild West.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.340
We had some customers using AWS.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.900
We had some customers using Azure.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:14.880
We had some customers that were calling Rackspace the cloud, which that's cool because back then they were about the only other thing out there.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.320
And then I came to Microsoft and did pretty much the same thing, but focused on Azure.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:25.480
And a few months ago, right around the same time Christos did, joined the identity team for helping developers understand identity.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:34.740
I think because as a developer myself, I know that I didn't care about identity until I started using it and realized, oh, if I don't have to deal with this on my own, I'm sold.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.500
I don't want to do this.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.400
I'm sort of, this is what I want to do.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:37.840
Yeah.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:50.780
And then seeing how many projects got completely sidetracked and blocked and had so many issues with identity because, you know, we have a, we're sort of a funny saying that we hear people say around our division of, we need to talk to identity developers.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:57.560
I was like, well, 1,500 identity developers in the world work for us because they care about identity and they want to build an identity system.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.600
Most of our customers don't want to build an identity system.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.120
They want to build an app and identity is the third checkbox in the list that they want to check off and get back to the other 200 tasks they have to do.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.500
Yeah.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.600
Well, it's one of those things that you have this idea, like, I really want to build this thing.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.640
It will be amazing.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:22.380
And nobody ever goes, and I want to have a super cool login or I want to have a really fantastic secure header exchange with my API.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:30.300
Like, nobody wants that, but you can't release the thing without an account and identity and, or some sort of authentication.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.080
Right.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.620
And it's, it's also, you talked about being nervous around the banking stuff.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.060
And so did I rightly so, but this is another one that will make you a little uncomfortable.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.560
If you get it wrong.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.020
Oh yeah.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.340
You know, you could end up in the news in the wrong way.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.220
You don't want that to happen.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:45.600
Yeah.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.080
We want you to be out of the news.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.660
So we have lots of companies out there that make the news every week for this exact reason.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.960
I think Troy Hunt, I don't know if you follow Troy Hunt, but he's a big security.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.220
Yeah.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.220
Troy Hunt has been on the show previously.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:57.860
Nice.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.940
Quite a while ago.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.400
But yeah, Troy is fantastic.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.000
He does.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.240
Have I been pwned?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.920
And he's a really good, he has a bunch of good ideas around what it means to proper security as a developer.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.140
Yeah.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.560
Yeah.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.340
But he's a, have I been pwned, right?

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:15.240
What nearly 10 billion accounts have been compromised and made it to the, to the news.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.080
So we don't want our developers or their companies to make it to those news, right?

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.540
We want them to make the news for good reasons like growth or whatever.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.500
But from a security perspective, it's very hard to get the authentication, right?

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.080
It's very hard to get authorization, right?

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.120
Especially if you're rolling it down yourself.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.320
And I've done this in the past.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.460
I am guilty of that.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.900
And I can tell you I've brought an awful system because I was learning as I was going and it was an internal app.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.200
So no big deal there.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.640
However, I just know how hard it is to do it yourself and do it right.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.500
Especially in the era of the internet where there are so many challenges out there.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.120
You put your app out on Azure or AWS, it becomes a public target whether you want it or not.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.080
You say that.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:14:00.620
But it's hard to appreciate how quick or how soon it becomes a target.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:06.760
So for example, if I open up any of my web apps, the training website or the podcast or whatever,

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.220
and I just tail the log of like these are the requests coming straight into it.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:23.860
It's less than a minute before I see somebody requesting like admin slash like WP admin slash like login dot PHP or some other random like well-known access point just constantly.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.760
And the thing is not built in web WordPress, but it doesn't matter.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.280
They're just pounding on any open endpoint that they can find to just start hitting it.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.700
So when you say that, it's that's probably within the first minute, at least once it becomes a well-known.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.340
IP address that is a host.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:38.820
Yeah.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.500
There's a funny story that goes with that.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:46.400
Once my website runs on a ghost, which is a lightweight kind of a platform for creating blogs.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.080
And yeah, I was working on that.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.000
And a friend of mine said, why are you deploying manually the files?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.820
You should just put it on GitHub and then have a GitHub action that pushes it straight into Azure.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.900
I'm like, oh, that's a great idea.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.080
And I pushed my solution to Azure.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.660
Now inside ghost, there's a send grid section, which allows you to send emails if people subscribe or whatever.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.020
And I forgot the live settings in that file.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.200
So I pushed to GitHub.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.480
I put in the public repo.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.820
I go to sleep.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.980
I get up the next morning.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.480
I get an email from send grid saying you hit your, I can't remember.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.040
I think it was two, 25,000 emails limit.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.140
I was like, that's fantastic.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.440
I went viral overnight.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.400
That's brilliant.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.240
And then I continue reading the emails.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.360
Some of the reasons why this may happen is you disclose credentials, check your GitHub.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.020
And that point the light bulb went on and thankfully I was still on the free tier.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.040
So I didn't have to pay anything, but just the stupidity of me putting these things out there.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.140
And developers do it all the time.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.020
We see RSA keys on GitHub.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:43.140
We see SSA keys for secrets or API, whatever.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.960
We don't want developers to do that.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.700
And it's a very easy mistake to do.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.640
So there you go.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.860
It's super easy.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:54.700
And it is much like I spoke about, like within the first minute you publish your site, it's going to start getting hammered on.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.040
Have you guys heard of shgit?

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.660
No.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.080
S-H-H-G-I-T?

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.700
No.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.840
So this is a shgit.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.100
I think it's a play on like, oh my goodness, git.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.300
But also secrets git.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.140
It's a thing.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.900
I'll put it in the show notes or something.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:18.700
But it finds committed secrets and sensitive files across GitHub, GIST, GitLab, and Bitbucket, or your local repositories in real time.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.240
Wow.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.860
And so there's like a continuous stream.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.900
This thing, it hooks into...

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.500
The public API for these things?

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:30.380
It hooks into like the public API for like changes to public endpoints on GitHub, basically.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.500
And it just, yeah, it's the real-time feed API.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.460
And it just watches those.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:41.240
And anytime it sees something come in, it just grabs like the secret keys and the auth keys for...

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.020
I'm looking at it.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.440
...Azure, AWS, GitHub.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.480
It's super disturbing.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.940
So, yeah, I mean, it's not like, oh, whoops, I have...

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.640
Somebody found my repo and this happened.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.000
Like, no, it's like a live stream that was probably captured from that.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.340
And so it's not good.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.240
Well, I think the way we look at it is like security sort of starts with the identity.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.820
If you can't secure the identity, then your app sort of...

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.420
Your app can never be secure, right?

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.360
If you can't reliably know who people are and what they can do, so...

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:09.520
Yeah.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.360
And it's worth throwing out.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.960
Like, you could end up on have I been pwned?

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.540
Very likely.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.040
Not because necessarily identity directly, but SQL injection, other badness.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.080
But nonetheless, identity is the first gateway.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.360
So let's talk about identity.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.640
You know, when I hear about people talk about security, they say the three A's.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.120
And identity, even though it doesn't have an A in the word, maybe is part of that.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:37.140
We've got a fourth A, but I guess we'll start with the first three, right?

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:37.500
All right.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.580
Tell me about the fourth A, because I only know where the three is.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.780
So I'm excited to hear.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.800
I'm going to learn something today.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.760
So we have authentication, right?

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.620
So we need to know who the user is.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:52.900
So when we authenticate somebody, we say, hey, we know user ABC, John, is the John that we're

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.500
expecting from a trusted provider or with certain properties.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.960
We can authenticate them correctly and in a way that we can trust.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.240
Right.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.160
The second big one is authorization.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:09.980
So authorization is all about, now that I know who John is, what can this person do in the app?

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.700
What type of data can they?

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.080
Right.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.980
Are they an admin?

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.960
Can they create invoices?

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.700
Can they view them?

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.180
Are they just allowed to like, I don't know, something else?

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.540
And what can they view?

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.440
What can they do?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.280
What kind of actions can they take on that data?

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.600
But then we get into auditing.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.280
So you know what's been happening.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.400
And that's the third A.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:33.840
So logging, be it identity system logging, your app logging, all of those logs and correlating

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.660
them together so that you can either be alerted when something sideways is going on or so you

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.740
at least know what's happened historically when you're investigating an incident or something

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.200
like that.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:49.580
The fourth one is access control, which is actually enforcing control to what people have access

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:49.920
to.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:55.220
And usually that falls to your app, but lots of different identity systems, third

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.900
party identity systems have ways to enforce that access control themselves too.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.200
Right.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.700
You hear like exchange of claims, things like that potentially, right?

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.140
Yep.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.140
Like the identity provider says you have this, that you claim this right or something, even

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.340
though it's not necessarily built in your app, your app kind of trusts it.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:09.720
Right.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.940
And that's the whole point is a way for an app to say, I'm going to let somebody else do handle

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.500
the authentication bit for me and maybe even the authorization bit.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:24.400
I'm going to let them do it and send you back to me with this package of data, some package.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.740
It could be a set of claims.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:31.280
It could be a JWT and claims in the JWT, but it could be something else completely opaque

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:31.780
and arbitrary.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.480
It doesn't really matter how it's done or what the package looks like.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.580
What matters is that when you get it back as the developer, you can validate that it's

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.560
true and that it's real.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.740
And it came from where you expected it to come from.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:47.680

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:54.180
I'm starting to feel like these identity providers, they're almost like one of the first microservices.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.500
Yeah, for sure.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.680
They're like a separate place you go, but then your app sort of talks to them and so on, kind

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.380
of before microservices were cool, before they were not cool again.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.160
But pretty interesting.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.680
So the four A's, access control there on the end, and the first A, I feel like that's

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.260
identity, right?

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:12.920
Who are you?

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.460
Yeah.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.080
How do you prove to me you are who you say you are?

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.520
Well, a complete system, like a complete identity provider will give you all four A's because

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.760
just authentication is slightly incomplete.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.360
But yeah, you're right.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.800
I mean, when we talk about identity, maybe we refer to who you are to start with.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.180
Right.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.720
So that's a good question, right?

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.620
Like, what does identity mean when you maybe are talking about like, well, what does our app

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.000
need?

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.020
What mechanism should we choose to provide identity, right?

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:44.140
Like that, you got to be talking about the same thing so that you have to decide on the

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:44.760
same trade-offs.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.780
I think that's worthwhile.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.440
True.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.180
So let's start at the beginning.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:53.140
Like, let's say mostly the beginning, I care about the first A and I just want something

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:53.540
simple.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.860
So I'm just going to create a username password field.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.580
Like, this is still the most common way, I think, that logins happen on the internet.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.140
Oh, yeah.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.700
Yeah.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.300
There's a lot of people saying that the usernames and passwords are going away in different ways.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:05.580
I know.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.340
I think even Microsoft is working on something.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.920
You've got YubiKeys.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.140
Like, YubiKeys scare the daylights out of me.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.640
Like, I love the idea of the YubiKey.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.660
But what if I lose it?

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.140
It's like a password vault, but I can't get it back.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:22.300
I know there's probably some mechanism where I can, I don't know, get it back.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.480
But there's other things other than passwords.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.460
But let's talk about username and password just for a minute.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.480
Because I feel like a lot of people are going to start there.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:28.640
Yeah.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.540
They're going to say, well, we're going to need users.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.260
So let's have them have a password.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:37.200
We're going to put up a dialogue or some kind of page that says, log in or create an account.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.360
Did you forget your account here?

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.940
Enter your email address and we'll send you one.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.620
And that almost always has to be the very second feature.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.080
The very next feature you implement is, how do you reset your password?

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.620
Because it's incredible how frequently people forget their passwords.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.440
Have you spoken to my wife?

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.800
Because she drives me crazy.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.760
We have a password manager for the house.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.180
We use Bitwarden these days.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.000
And there are lots of different tools out there.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.320
Okay.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:08.280
But for the last 10 years, I'm trying to instill in her that she should not be using the same password everywhere.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:08.800
Yes.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.700
And when she doesn't do that, she doesn't record what password she uses.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.780
So she always resets the passwords when she needs to go somewhere.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.120
The problem is that not every site is optimized to respond real time.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.780
So you might say, I forgot my password.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.400
And then you don't receive an email for two hours or two days.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.660
So you can't use that site until you get the recent password email.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.420
So I'm trying to say to her, like, please don't do that.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.800
Just use our password manager.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.680
So lately, thank God, lately, in the last six months, she started using Bitwarden.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:34.980
Yeah.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.620
And then I checked her Bitwarden account.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.660
And I saw that most of the passwords were very small variations of the same password.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.900
Like, there's a way to automatically generate very long passwords.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:44.920
Yes, I know.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.480
Not the long passwords that John is using, because I think he's like 90 characters long.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.860
But for me, 24 characters randomized through a tool is great.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:53.460
Sorry.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:53.840
Yeah.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.360
Let's go back to resetting passwords.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.960
Well, I think what you're talking about is super interesting.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.280
A lot of people say that username and password are kind of broken and they're not going to work

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.720
for the reason that you kind of just laid out with your wife.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.500
On the other hand, if you use something, so I use one password.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.420
We're a one password family over here.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.300
But people talk about the challenge of logging in.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.160
And I'm going to get to the developer side of this quick.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.440
But I just want to riff on this because it drives me crazy.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.500
Like, oh, this username and password, I can't use it.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.260
What I want is some kind of bio-authentication.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.740
I want a YubiKey or something like that.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:25.140
And to me, my experience of logging into a website is I go to the website.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.980
I hit command backspace.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.140
That auto fills it.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.840
Either it auto fills it or it'll say you have to log in.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.140
So I put my finger on the fingerprint reader on my Mac and then it auto fills it.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.660
So to me, my login is there's stuff that happens in the middle.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.520
That's usually like a 30 or 40 character thing that exchange with the site.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.740
But to me, it's I put my finger on my Mac and then I log into the site.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.260
Yeah.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.260
So that's an interesting thing, I think.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:48.600
Yeah.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.960
The user experience and security are sort of in direct conflict with each other, right?

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.560
They often are.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:02.140
So when it's a miserable experience to add MFA, for example, like multi-factor to do your phone

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.360
or YubiKey or whatever, when that's a miserable experience, nobody uses it.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.780
So like my parents literally have a physical book that they've written their passwords

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.020
in.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.660
So in some ways, it's kind of, yeah, somebody's got to break into their house to get it.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.460
It's so interesting because people say you should never write down your password.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.840
Like the last thing I'm worried about is someone physically seeing my written password.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.120
And so, yeah, exactly.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:29.400
Like I am so paranoid of a virus or something getting into my computer or sniffing network

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:29.700
traffic.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.380
Like the notebook actually seems pretty safe as long as you're not reusing the password.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:34.780
Yeah.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.520
To be honest.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.300
But they still reuse the password.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.560
And then like.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.520
Yes, that's the problem.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.300
Netflix.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.980
And not to call Netflix out specifically, but I encountered this a lot.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.380
I've got like some crazy password that LastPass generated.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.400
Apparently, we all use different password managers.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.700
I have some crazy password.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.780
Sorry, we can still get along.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.880
It'd be like a fight like from Anchorman or whatever.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.700
But I've got this, you know, 900 character password or something silly.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.300
And I went to a hotel and it's like, hey, use your Netflix account in the hotel.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.540
I was like, oh, that'd be fun.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.960
And then I hit the login button and it says, oh, type in your password.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.660
I'm like, no, I'm not going to type it in.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.320
Probably with the remote control.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.660
With the remote control.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.040
Right.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.520
So I immediately pulled the plug on that and said, well, I guess I'm just going to the

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.660
bar or something instead.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.440
And but that experience is the same even when you're at home on your own TV.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.300
And so people end up shortening their passwords to something they can remember, something that's

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.700
easy to type in on a remote control, which is why you see most of those services moving

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.820
to a web based thing where you go to a specific website, type in a short code.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.980
And the one time code is what connects your account to your TV.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.340
Yeah, that's a nice system.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:40.580
Yeah.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.440
Because then all of those other things like, oh, you're we don't know who you are.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.140
You should use your multi-factor or you were going to send you a text message to make sure

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:48.620
it's you.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.800
All that can happen on your phone and it doesn't have to be implemented for the device.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.220
Right.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.660
And then your phone already knows who you are.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.780
You're already logged in.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.100
So on the developer side of this username and password, I think the username and password

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.280
story is pretty straightforward.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.280
And I don't know it's necessarily to be discounted because for a lot of simple things, it kind

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.160
of it does make sense as opposed to a Facebook login.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.720
But it's not it shouldn't be discounted.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.740
But the challenge there is that it is not just the username and password that you need to store

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.620
somewhere and then bring back and validate that when the user inputs the username and password,

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.480
it's the correct one.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.660
It's all the other things that happen around that.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.640
So for example, password reset, how do I do my password reset?

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.400
So as a developer, now you have to implement it.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:28.580
Yeah.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.560
Adding MFA.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.520
I'm not joking.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.160
It literally gets used like the first 10 minutes you launch an app.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.500
Yeah.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.820
Right.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.280
Exactly.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.420
You're just gone here.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.580
It's never existed before.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.800
Why are you resetting your password?

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.680
But no, it happens.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.640
Yeah.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.840
That one.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.040
And then it's the MFA if you want to do that.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.340
And if you want to add a notification, so you have to integrate SendGrid or whatever tools

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.100
you want to use.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:51.400
Yeah.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.900
So it shouldn't be discounted, especially if you're writing a simple app.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.760
But at the same time, like I tried when I went back in 2007, I was implementing that solution

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.700
I mentioned before.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:05.820
I had to implement incremental backoff for if you enter your password too many times and

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.560
then you're not the right one, then you have as a developer to manually roll that aim.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.460
Now, how do you do it efficiently and how do you protect your app from...

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.180
In fact, I was listening to Troy's podcast back then.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.400
I was like, oh, yeah, he's got some blog post that explains how to do it and why you should

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:20.980
be doing it.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:21.500
Right.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.340
Let's go and do that.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:29.000
But if I hadn't heard Troy saying that, then my website would be viable to or prone to a

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.920
password spray attack or a brute force attack.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.180
Yeah.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:31.760
So...

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.280
Yeah, for sure.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:32.800
Absolutely.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:38.360
You can do it, but it just requires a lot of steps beyond just a simple username password

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:38.960
implementation.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.320
Yeah.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.720
So I think we're going to move off of this one and to the next level.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.100
But before we do, I just...

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.680
I would feel remiss if I didn't talk about passlib in the Python space.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.140
Passlib is so incredibly awesome.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:55.380
Because another thing that you got to talk about is how do I store that password?

00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:01.360
It had better not be in a VARCHAR 16, the length of my password and just going straight

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:01.980
in there, right?

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.880
It had better be at least hashed.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.120
Yeah.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:11.280
And not with MD5, but with a complex hash like bcrypt or a SHA512 or something like that.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.580
Then you probably need to mix in salt, which is instead of just hashing the text, you also

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.220
hash like a random other bit of text.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.140
So you can't do rainbow lookups on it, rainbow tables.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.560
And then you need that to be computationally expensive for guessing, just like you were

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.300
talking about, right?

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:31.160
So passlib is awesome because it does all those things, but then it also folds the hash back.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.760
So when you say hash this, it doesn't do it once.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.240
It creates the salt, it hashes it.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:40.280
And then it does it by default 150,000 times, takes the output, feeds it back in, takes the

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.640
output next time, iterates it 150,000 times.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.520
That's the answer.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:49.240
So it's computationally expensive to guess if you ever have, which is beautiful, I think.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:55.720
So if you're going to go down it, consider if not using passlib, the ideas encapsulated

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.400
in it as a really good idea.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:57.760
Yeah.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.500
I mean, the net of that, and probably the theme you'll hear over and over from us today is

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.620
don't write that library yourself.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.980
Yes.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.240
Don't write your own passlib.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:13.980
Let people who understand the cryptography behind making it computationally expensive, let

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.800
them do it because there are a whole lot more eyeballs and a whole lot more sort of skill

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.640
sets involved in getting those libraries out the door than anyone.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:28.520
We shouldn't expect a developer who's building an app to necessarily be super, super deep on

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:34.140
what's the best hashing algorithm for me to use for a password or God forbid, try to implement

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.480
it on their own because it's just, there's too much risk for bugs.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:43.060
And in fact, so many of the breaches that we see, they end up pointing back to some homegrown

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.720
system that was either completely built from the ground up to be sort of rolled on their

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:53.540
own or was maybe used a library here or there, but ultimately had some sort of critical flaw

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.580
in the path of hashing passwords.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.120
Right.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.600
It may start with one of these, well, I don't trust that third party library to do

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.200
our encryption.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.000
That's exactly how it starts.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.600
That's always how it starts.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.860
It's the same with the frameworks, right?

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.480
I don't trust the .NET framework.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.980
I'm going to roll out my own framework on top of .NET just to prove you guys.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:11.580
Yeah.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:12.620
Yeah, exactly.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.520
Yeah, exactly.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.520
For sure.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.700
There are one silence just to finish on this one.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:21.360
I don't mind people building their own stuff, like their own username and passwords using

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.760
existing libraries, but it does require some basic knowledge of certain things.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.280
Like today you can walk into a room of developers and ask them to explain the difference between

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.900
encryption and hashing and half of them will get it wrong.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:33.160
Yeah.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.640
Because I've been in companies where they say we have secure passwords, we're encrypting

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:36.800
them.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.500
And like, no, no, that is not secure.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.040
And let me explain why.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.920
So yes, do it if you want to play with that, but just make sure you know that the terminology

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.160
and what you need to do.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:47.600
Yeah.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.640
That's always an option.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.360
A huge red flag for me is when I go to a site.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:51.740
Yes.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.820
And it says it has an upper bound on the length of the password.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.300
Yes.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.860
The password has to be less than 16K.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:58.980
It's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.040
Because when you hash it, it's always the same size.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.600
It doesn't matter how big the input is.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.060
Exactly.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:04.660
Yep.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.820
So you must be mapping that text to something where it directly relates to the size of it.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.140
This is disturbing to me.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:11.540
Yeah.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.020
What's worse?

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.580
It's when it's the company you pay your mortgage to every month.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.520
Oh.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:15.760
Yep.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.480
Oh, my bank has like a 12 character limit.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.140
I'm like, what is going on?

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.120
Mine's the same way.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.440
This is insane to me.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.620
It needs to be between eight and 12 characters.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.720
It's like eight and 12.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.640
Way to reduce the attack space considerably for the person guessing passwords.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.400
Jeez.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.300
Exactly.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.180
Why don't you just tell them my social security number?

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:34.500
All right.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.380
All right.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:52.600
So I want to talk about some of the other stuff where you sort of delegate or transfer some of this identity, maybe to a federated identity or some sort of social authentication or just a central identity service that you have at your company that then powers your other apps.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.160
And there's a bunch of different pieces in here.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.320
And I have no idea where to fit them together, honestly.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.660
We have OAuth.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.260
And there's OAuth 1.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.420
And then that became sort of outdated.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.560
So there's OAuth 2.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.180
And then we have OpenID Connect.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.480
What's the relationship?

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:06.960
All these things.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.280
Like, where do these fit into the world?

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.280
You guys tell me about this.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:09.980
Tell us all about this.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:22.180
So OAuth 1 was the first attempt at a way for two systems that don't have any sort of inherent trust between them to talk to each other and have a little bit of trust.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.060
And it was all centered around a user.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:31.460
And so a user would say, hey, I want to give app ABC access to my data that's in app 123.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:37.560
Very much like on your cell phone when your cell phone pops up and says, hey, this app wants access to your contacts.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.760
Do you want to allow this to happen?

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.160
Right.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.300
It's a very similar sort of mechanism.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.380
And then OAuth 1.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.760
But over the internet instead of like on the phone.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.400
That's right.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.160
But yeah.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.620
And OAuth 1 was sort of quickly invalidated.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:53.240
And then we had 490 or some ridiculous number of drafts of OAuth 2.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.740
And then we finally got to OAuth 2.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.480
But the thing about OAuth 2 is that it's purely an authorization framework.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:03.860
It's all about giving app 123 access to app ABC's data.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.860
It has nothing to do with the user, actually.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.860
So you're not doing any authentication there.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:13.860
The system is authenticating the user because it needs to know to whom you're giving access to your data.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:21.540
But the application itself that you're using, say, the mobile app on your phone, doesn't actually know who you are in OAuth or OAuth 2.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.340
It can access your data and it can infer a lot of things about you.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.200
But the identity system is not actually telling you who they are.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:32.300
So OpenID Connect is sort of a superset of OAuth 2.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:43.240
And so OpenID Connect gives an application that extra token that says, hey, this is user ABC and this is their first name, last name, email address, you know, whatever properties that you want to send over.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.160
And it's specifically intended for authentication to happen.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:47.520
Okay.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.080
Yeah.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:48.620
Very cool.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:53.540
What are some of the use cases, like concrete examples maybe that you see out in the world of these?

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.020
So we'll start with OpenID Connect because that's, in some ways, it's the more simple one.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.260
It's the more basic one.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:34:59.600
Yeah.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.920
OpenID Connect is used for signing a user in to a web app, to a mobile app, whatever.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.420
So let's say I've got a, let's say, let's say I'm going to my office mailbox in Office 365.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.140
We might as well use a real example.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.540
At least a few people have those mailboxes.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.300
So we'll use one of those.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:20.640
And so when you go to, when you try to go to Office 365 and sign in, it asks you for your username and password and you type those in.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.900
And then those go off to what we have, which is Azure AD, some sort of centralized directory service.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.020
That centralized.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.000
This is super common in large enterprises.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000
They've got an active directory that like owns the definition of identity for like the whole company and everything somehow has to talk to it.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.240
Yep.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.860
Or same with your Gmail, right?

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:45.840
Let's use Google and let's use Gmail because that's probably, that's going to remove the confusion of organizational stuff for the moment.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.380
So I'm just a guy with a Gmail account and I go to sign in.

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:57.660
Gmail itself is not actually doing any authentication because Gmail is one of 5 billion apps that, that Google has.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.200
That they haven't deprecated yet.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.540
So yeah, maybe next year.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.700
There's a great Twitter account called what is Google killed or whatever.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.920
I don't remember exactly what it was.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.100
It started after reader.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.980
I think reader was the, that was the tipping point for a lot of people.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.300
Anyway.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:16.300
So when I go to Gmail and I type in my username and password, it's the same experience every time.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.500
I see that same classic Gmail or Google sign in window in the middle of the screen.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.820
And I type in my username and type in my password.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.240
And it's like accounts.google.com I think is the actual website.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.320
And accounts.google.com plus this long URL that comes after it.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:39.680
The part of that path of the URL is what has all the bits of data that the Google authentication system understands to know you're trying to go to Gmail.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:46.720
So when I go and type in my username and password, the Google account system is the thing that checks my username and password.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.760
It also checks the request and says, oh, you're trying to go to Gmail.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.240
So I'm going to send you back to Gmail.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.440
I'm going to redirect you to mail.google.com, for example.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.520
And I'm going to have a specific chunk of information that I send along with you.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.140
And usually it's in the form of an ID token, ID underscore token.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:03.580
Okay.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:08.820
And inside that ID token is a bunch of data for the application.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.400
So in this case, Gmail to go look at and say, oh, okay, I know who this user is.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:19.080
So I'm going to go look at my application database and pull back email and pull back tags and that sort of thing.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.100
And so that's OpenID Connect.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.840
And that's purely for getting signed into an application.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.960
So now we're signed in.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.960
So Gmail knows who I am and they can start showing me my email.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.420
Right.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.640
There's probably not really many rules around what you're allowed to do.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.480
Like Gmail users just do this.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:32.980
Right.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:33.500
All right.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.240
They read their email.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:34.920
They send email.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.140
But just what data do you have access to?

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.420
Not can you administer Gmail for other users and stuff like that?

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:42.200
Like that's not a thing.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:42.580
Right.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.480
Better not be a thing.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:49.180
Well, and so sort of as a part of that, though, is that there may be an administrative interface in Google.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.180
You may have access to somebody else's mailbox.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.000
You may have access to something, some extra functionality.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.480
Yeah.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.320
And like the business version of Google, their apps, Google apps.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:58.440
Yeah.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:06.180
So once you're signed in, Gmail itself, the Gmail app doesn't know my username and password for Google.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:06.700
It doesn't.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.720
I never gave it to Gmail directly.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:16.380
I give it to the Google account system and the Google account system authenticates me and checks my password and maybe prompts my phone or whatever.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.620
And then it sends back this blob of data to Gmail.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:31.100
And because Gmail trusts the Google account system, it can validate that, oh, the Google account system actually wrote this, actually wrote this token because it's got their signature on it and make sure that it's valid.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.000
And then let me into my email.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.320
That validation process is fairly standard for most things, for most JWTs, for example.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.400
See, I can't talk about Google with a Google phone sitting next to me because it thinks I'm talking to it.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.340
Here's some things I found for you.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.540
Let me check that on the web.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.140
Sorry, I can't do that right now.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.920
That's probably the most common response.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:59.140
But the thing about it, though, is that Gmail system has to validate that the token came from the Google account system.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:04.420
And typically we do that in the JWT world where you get a JWT, a JSON web token.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.120
Typically, those are signs.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.640
So there's a cryptographic signature that sits at the end of that.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:24.300
And the identity system, the Google account system, for example, publishes enough data for Gmail to go and check that key and make sure that it was signed actually by the Google account system to say, yeah, we know that this came from the Google account system, so we can trust it.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:24.760
All right.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.040
That way, you know, it's not being faked or man in the middle sort of thing.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.600
But then you already trust that service and then you can verify everything you got from it was not tampered with.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.140
That's right.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:35.620
Cool.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:36.220
All right.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.880
Let's go next to federated identity.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:51.900
So what you've talked about so far is one app doesn't want to do the identity management itself because how painful would it be to log into your Google calendar with a separate account to your Google Docs with a separate account?

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.200
Right.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.720
You just want to have a Google account and then log into these things.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:06.060
But a lot of times there might be some app that is calling, say, an API, and then that API wants to call another API carrying forward that same identity or something along those lines.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:06.260
Right.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:12.660
I want you to be able to log into that system, which then allows you to log into effectively delegate that identity to an external system.

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:22.860
I'm like, I don't know if this actually works, but I want to log into my corporate account, which then allows me to log into my business Dropbox account by just virtue of being on the network.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.180
Right.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:30.200
Or I want to be able to log into my corporate account and then take Talk Python courses by just passing that identity along through federated identity.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:30.500
Right.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.060
Yeah.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:31.740
Correct.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.260
Well, the key is you're never passing the identity along.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.140
And logically we are, but technically you never are.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.400
So let's go back to Google for a second, to Gmail.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.000
Okay.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.100
So your Gmail has the option to connect to your Outlook and pull your Outlook email into Gmail.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:57.740
So when the Gmail front end, when the app that you're using needs to connect to that service, that service is going to require some kind of authorization from the user.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:03.840
For the user to say, yeah, I want the Gmail app to be able to go and talk to, or to be able to read my email.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:13.080
In order to do that, when we're calling the effectively the Outlook.com API, for lack of a better term, we need the user to go and approve that request and say, yeah, I want to do that.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.060
Which is typically called consent.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:22.700
And so when a user consents, they get the window that says, hey, would you like to allow app 123 to access your data in this service?

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.660
In this case, would you like Gmail to be able to access Outlook?

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.400
When you click allow or yes, that's okay.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.700
That's when a new token is issued.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:38.120
So you as a developer of the Gmail application, you go and talk to the identity system for the other party.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:44.700
So in our case, Azure AD and Outlook.com and say, hey, please give me a token for user 123.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:42:00.520
And so if the user has gone through and authenticated correctly, that first API, the Gmail API for if we want to call it that, that goes through a round sort of a back and forth with the other authentication system and says, hey, this is what the user provided.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.860
Please give me a token for this next service.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:08.320
And so each step in that service is typically called a sort of a that's a more of a traditional OAuth.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:14.260
But each one of those steps needs to have its own token to talk to those downstream services.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:25.980
Because if I tried to reuse a token for a different service, in most cases, most properly built OAuth services and APIs will reject that token and say, no, I didn't issue this token for you.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.480
I issued it for this upstream service that you're trying to call.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:29.980
Right.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:30.620
OK.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.400
And what kind of systems can you use to set up that the federated identity?

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.980
I know Azure has some federated identity thing like what that and what else?

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.180
There's Azure AD, of course, we offer.

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.560
There are others like Okta and Auth0 that are all sort of identity as a service.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:53.500
So those are service providers who are offering a full holistic SaaS type thing, software as a service where.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.360
Yeah, I'm on the fence about Auth0.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:01.380
It looks interesting to me, but the pricing model looks like it could get out of control pretty quick for a lot of scenarios.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.880
But it looks nice.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:08.520
Every time I've looked at it, I've always been curious to the pricing, but I can't say too much because we work for competitors.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.400
I don't want to say anything about it.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.680
Yeah, you don't have to say anything.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:21.060
But it's like you pay a little bit like the mail list companies like MailChimp and Drip and ConvertKit, all those things.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.500
You're like, this should be pretty affordable.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:26.140
And then all of a sudden you're like, why am I paying $400 a month just to have emails?

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:26.760
Yeah.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.880
Maybe I should switch.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.680
Oh, that one's $500.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.820
So once you kind of get into these realms, I don't know.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.420
I mean, I can't say exactly what it is, but it sort of felt to me like that.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.100
Yeah.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:35.640
Yeah.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.420
Anyway, sorry, it's a bit of a diversion, but.

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:38.020
No, it's okay.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:40.700
A lot of it depends on what the key is for pricing.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:50.160
Like the way that we bill is for certain features, the way that other providers bill might be for certain like number of users or number of applications.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.740
There are all sorts of different metrics that the different providers bill on.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.900
And it just kind of depends on what you're doing as to which one of those metrics makes the most sense.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:58.180
Yeah.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:58.420
Yeah.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.740
And just to like set the context for people, I didn't want to be fair to Auth0, but also let people know.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.660
So I just looked at their pricing.

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.560
They're up to a thousand users, which is not a lot.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:12.280
Like if I, you know, like Talk Python Training is way more than a thousand users, $23 a month.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:16.360
But just 5,000 active users is $1,000 a month for identity.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.220
Oh, that is a lot.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.580
Like if it's, yeah, if it's over 7,000, like you got to get in touch.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:29.740
So anyway, that's a high burden to carry on top of like your other expenses and trying to run a business when you're starting out or whatnot.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:30.200
So anyway.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:30.600
Yeah.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.360
That's what I thought when I was thinking of that.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:40.460
I guess in fairness, I should say that our consumer identity product, which is called Azure ADB2C, your first 50,000 monthly active users are free.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:40.880
Yeah.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.920
So you can start using that immediately.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:47.680
And once you have 50,000 monthly active users, maybe you've got a good problem anyway.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.860
And spending, you know.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:49.500
Yeah, exactly.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.340
Spending a couple of bucks on an identity system won't be a big deal.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:52.900
Yeah, for sure.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:45:01.680
And one of the things about these systems is that the convenience that you get of not you having to manage the deployment, the maintenance and the scalability of the system.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:06.020
So whichever identity provider you go to, depending on your choices, hopefully you'll come with us.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.420
But, you know, that's not a prerequisite.

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:16.320
I would rather have a developer say, you know, we're going with X provider because we want to do right rather than us having to go and put out fires because they did their own thing.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:22.280
But whatever you do, there's always this kind of a trade-off where I don't have to roll it out myself.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.340
And I know that these companies are dedicated to doing that.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:29.280
And you get to pay a little bit more to get that convenience out.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.140
So security is always this kind of a trade-off where do I pay for it?

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.580
And there's no 100% security.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.140
So as close to 100% you get, that's great.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:37.440
Yeah.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.720
And it's with everything.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:45.180
I think where the really interesting value comes in is the integration between other identity providers, right?

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.400
Like you can kind of do username, password yourself all you want and it's okay.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.400
But like once you're like, well, we're going to talk to this system and then we want to integrate with their identity.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.520
Like all of a sudden it explodes in complexity.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:58.780
And we were talking about, you kind of got to do a little work to do your own username, password stuff.

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:02.000
You should never try to do this.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.360
Like the cryptographic exchanges and stuff in the back and forth.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.880
It just, it's insane.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.340
Some of this.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.280
So like, you don't want to mess with this, right?

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:09.680
Yeah.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.700
Not by hand.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:19.760
I had a customer I worked with a while back and they had a really old legacy app that was ColdFusion 10 and couldn't be moved past ColdFusion 10.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.460
Impressive.

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:20.980
Yeah.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:24.380
I was impressed it was still running, but they still had a server that would run that.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:30.000
But the thing is, ColdFusion 10 went out of support before OpenID Connect became a standard.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.520
So there are no libraries for OpenID Connect.

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.940
So we helped them write one.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.020
And it's not for the faint of heart.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:45.480
I mean, there's a ton of signing and cryptographic signatures that happen, both signing the tickets themselves and then reading them to make sure they're okay.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.380
And it's certainly not something I'd want to do on a regular basis.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.980
It's a high stress, high stress job, built writing identity code.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.600
Yeah.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.840
It's super frustrating to debug that stuff, too.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.200
It's like, we don't validate the certificates.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.440
Like, oh my gosh, why?

00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.260
What is going on?

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.220
Anyway, like, I don't want to bring back pain.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:05.040
So I'll go to a separate therapy session for this.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.220
We should offer separate therapy sessions as a service.

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.220
Yes, you should.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.080
For identity developers.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:12.700
All right.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:17.860
So let's make this concrete for everyone out there and doing Python programming.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.640
There's a host of libraries that are available for you.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:25.360
You could just pip install them and then go integrate them into your apps.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.500
Not necessarily for the username password story.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.140
Like, that's built into Django.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:33.160
I talked about pass love and, like, integrating that's pretty easy.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.760
But, you know, things like OAuth, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect and whatnot.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:41.900
So one of my favorite places, when I have no idea what I'm doing in a corner of Python,

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:44.520
is to go to awesome-python.com.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:48.020
And those are not all of the libraries in an area.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.960
But those are libraries that have gotten submitted a certain number of times.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.640
And once they cross a threshold, they're, like, popular enough to be in there.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.020
There's my understanding how that place works.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.120
So anyway, it's, like, kind of the popular recommended libraries.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.680
And they have an authentication section.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.240
So they've got an OAuth and a JWT section in here.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.260
So let's just talk about some of the ones that you might use.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.380
I mean, let's start with the Microsoft one,

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:14.840
because you guys have an interesting B2C and Azure AD library for Python, right?

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.180
Yeah, that's correct.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:20.040
I mean, for us, if you are going to use our identity system,

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.800
then there are two choices.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.060
And because we're built on top of open standards,

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.860
we give you choices in how you interact with our system.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.520
Now, if you are fairly new to our identity system

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.080
and you haven't done any authentication before,

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.620
then we do give you MSAL for Python or MSAL for whatever ecosystem you want, right?

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:37.580
So it's not just Python,

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.260
which follows the same standards that you should be following

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.340
and comes out of the box.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.080
It comes with samples and everything else.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.380
However, since we are abiding to open standards,

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.680
there's a number of other auth libraries out there.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.200
And as long as they're OpenID compliant and OAuth compliant,

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.740
then you can use your own thing.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.980
So you can bring your own libraries or you can use our libraries.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:01.720
We just want to make it easy to get off the ground and implement the solutions.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:07.160
So MSAL is the recommended for us if you're coming to Microsoft as a fresh greenfield project.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.840
But there's a list of other ones like Authlib, Django, Auth.

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:15.000
There's a whole list, right, of other solutions there.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:15.460
Yeah.

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.060
Yeah.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.920
So there's a couple for Django.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.180
I feel like Django has the biggest advantage here.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:23.500
There's a lot of ones that are just like plug-in middleware type of things.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.740
Whereas if you're in Flask or Pyramid or something else,

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.120
you kind of a lot of times you're like,

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.980
all right, well, how do I take this random library and integrate it?

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:38.120
So we've got Django-Oauth, which has the moniker JustWorks for authentication in Django,

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:38.780
which is nice.

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:39.320
Nice.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.860
It has all the authentication, right?

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.000
There's Django OAuth toolkit.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.080
And it says it'll help you provide out-of-the-box endpoints, data logic,

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.080
to add OAuth to capabilities to your Django projects.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:56.080
I think both, maybe both ends actually as a provider as well, which is pretty cool.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.300
You've got one that looks really flexible called OAuth Lib.

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:03.600
And this one's nice because it's a generic OAuth library, not just for, say, Django.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.320
But the problem with the generic ones is you kind of got to understand,

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.460
like there's the six chains.

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.120
There's like these five callbacks.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.640
You've got a hook or whatever, which is a pain.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.100
Yeah.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.040
You don't want that.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.760
You want just like, I do this and then I get the user.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:20.960
So what they did is there's a bunch of people who have built wrappers for common frameworks.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.480
So there's a Django OAuth toolkit, which wraps that.

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:29.040
There's the Flask OAuth and Flask Dance, which wrap this one.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:32.860
There's Pyramid-OAuth Lib, which wraps it for Pyramid and Bottle.

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:37.840
And it says if you have another library like Sanic or whatever, some other random web framework,

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.300
and you want to add that, you could write a thin wrapper around OAuth Lib and then add that

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:42.920
to your framework.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:43.860
So that's pretty cool.

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:50.080
Yeah, I think our library, we tried to balance sort of the Pythonic idioms so that it makes

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.460
sense if you're looking at it, if you're familiar with Python, that when you come to the library,

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.280
it makes sense how you use it, how you import it, how you integrate with it.

00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:02.960
But our focus has been really strong on know how to use the library and not necessarily having

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:06.860
to be a super deep protocol nerd to understand how to use it.

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:12.400
So most of the API surface where our library is fairly, it's fairly light.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:18.000
It's sign in user, get token quietly and get token by prompting the user.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.260
There really aren't that many protocol details that are leaked out of there.

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:22.940
That's good.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:27.920
Because, yeah, we want it to be as close to a just work kind of a scenario as we can.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:33.460
And when you've got OpenID 7 and OAuth 9, you can just keep the same API.

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:33.800
Exactly.

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.680
Well, a great example.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:39.100
So for a long time, there's been something called the implicit flow in OAuth.

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:43.920
And the implicit flow was the least secure flow of all of the ways you can use OAuth.

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:50.900
And there's a new thing, authorization code with PKCE, you hear called Pixie a lot, where

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.960
you don't need to worry about what the flow itself actually does.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.000
It obviates the need to use the implicit flow.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.980
So in apps where you have to use implicit today, you can use this Pixie-based flow tomorrow.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:06.120
And we updated our libraries to use that.

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:10.220
And we were working on a JavaScript app the other day, and we upgraded the package.

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.540
Nothing else changed.

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:15.180
Then we started using Pixie, and we didn't have to change a line of code, which was awesome.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:16.380
We just upgraded the package.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.040
So yeah, that's super cool.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:18.840
Yeah, nice.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:24.740
So our maintainers do what they can to keep the API surface as generic and consistent as

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:30.200
possible in the sense that it's very focused on what do you need to do rather than how does

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:30.960
it need to be done?

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.380
Right.

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:32.000
Okay.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.220
Yeah, that sounds great.

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:37.940
So one other place I want to give, one other library-ish, I guess library framework, I want

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:41.880
to give a shout out to in this space is FastAPI.

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:48.180
So for me, FastAPI is the hot new API framework in Python these days, right?

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.920
It's got fantastic support for async and await.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:57.360
It's got really cool support by taking Pydantic data exchange models with validation and automatically

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.660
binding like a JSON post over to it.

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:03.560
But it also comes with OAuth 2 scopes directly built in.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:09.220
So it lets you work with more fine-grained permissions and do many of the big integrations

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:13.180
with providers like Facebook and GitHub, Microsoft, they call it explicitly.

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:17.900
So yeah, so that's kind of built into the API there, which is pretty cool.

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:18.700
That's cool.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:19.040
Yeah.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:24.000
And I think because we're standards-backed, if a library is implementing OIDC, OpenID Connect,

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.300
or OAuth 2 to spec, they should work with our system and any other system really without

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:30.220
having to make any changes.

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:31.700
It all just comes down to configuration.

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:37.360
And it's also worth noting too that an API developer, someone who's building an API, their

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:41.220
concerns are going to be a little bit different than someone who's building, say, a web app that

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.280
consumes that API.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:46.880
Because an API, I don't necessarily need to log into an API.

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:52.020
I need to validate a token that's coming in from some other client, a web client or a

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:52.920
mobile client or whatever.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:57.500
And so the things that I'm concerned about more are, can I validate that this is a real

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:57.880
token?

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.700
And then what does the token allow this user to do?

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:05.660
Which is just a different set of concerns than say, I'm building a front-end web app and

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:09.700
I need to let a user sign in and then determine what they need to do and call APIs.

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:10.040
Yeah.

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.900
Because one of those, you're just receiving something you need to check.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.140
And the other thing, you need to handle the actual acquisition of one of those tokens.

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:16.540
Right.

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:17.300
Which can get tricky.

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.640
Like that provider over there said their email address was this.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.400
So I'm going to assume that I can identify them by that.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.520
But is that really their email?

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.060
Because they could have lied to that place.

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.540
There's a lot of interesting stuff there.

00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:34.760
So I think this gives us a pretty good range of the world in this identity space and some

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:35.840
of the libraries we can use.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:42.180
But I definitely want to have a short conversation, especially with you, Christos, because we went

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:49.900
off on this before we hit record about depending on basically social media for your identity

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:51.280
in other places.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:51.620
Right.

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:56.880
So that's, I want to go, like you go to places, you can create an account with a username or password,

00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:02.460
or you can use Facebook, or you can use Twitter, or you can use Google, or you can use Microsoft

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.380
or whatever.

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:04.560
How does that make you feel?

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.180
You like it?

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:05.860
You're a fan?

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:09.760
I am partial to it, as we were discussing before.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.420
I think it's a great convenience.

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:15.860
If you are creating a consumer app, you want your consumers to be able to log in.

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:21.020
So let's say your Walmart or whichever account, you want people to come into your shop and buy

00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:22.300
with great convenience.

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.700
And I know a lot of people just don't use the right tools.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.820
So they don't want to go and create a username and passwords for every single website.

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.380
However, yeah.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:29.740
All right.

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:34.060
They have these thoughts like, oh, if I'm going to create an account here, how can I trust this

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.520
random thing on the internet to not like get hacked or lose my password?

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.260
Exactly.

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:43.180
To me, I don't feel that way because it's a 40 character randomly generated thing.

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:43.600
True.

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.300
If it gets lost, whatever, right?

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.420
But anyway, yeah, carry on.

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:46.740
Yeah.

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.500
But you're right.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:51.480
I mean, I tend to avoid using my social media accounts for logging in.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.920
First, because I don't remember which one I use where.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:59.300
And that means that if I go to a site I haven't used in a year, like, did I use Google or did

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:00.020
I use Facebook?

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:04.960
And every time you actually go back and use a different social media account, it creates

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:05.800
a new account for you.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:09.620
So you might log in with a new account and suddenly like, where's my basket?

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.280
Where are my orders from last year?

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.000
And what have you?

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.520
So it's a little bit confusing.

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:13.940
Right.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:17.140
So a year ago you went in there and you said, ah, I feel like Twitter is the one I want to

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:17.280
use.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:17.460
Yeah.

00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:17.680
Right.

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.340
So you said Twitter.

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.220
And you created an account and it knows your Twitter.

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.460
And then you go back here and you're like, gosh, I could log with Twitter, Facebook,

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:24.960
GitHub with all this.

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.680
Probably I chose Facebook and that is a totally different account.

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:33.160
It's as if you used a different username and password and you're like, well, what is this?

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:33.340
Right.

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.020
There's no, it drives me crazy.

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:39.900
There's no real record of that unless you hunt through like your authorized apps and your different

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:41.760
social media platforms to find it.

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.180
Correct.

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:44.520
So I can see the convenience there.

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:48.060
And I know that some people like to sign everywhere with their Facebook account and they only have

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:48.520
that one.

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.780
But at the same time, it creates a bit of a lock in.

00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:54.960
So if I decide to delete my Facebook account for whatever reason, if I decide to stop using

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:59.640
Google from now on, then that means everywhere I sign with my Google account is now not accessible

00:56:59.640 --> 00:56:59.960
anymore.

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.300
So I have to go and create a brand new identity for me.

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:06.600
So to people that like to use them, I would just say approach them with caution, but they're

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.260
more secure, right?

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.240
So you don't have to create a username and password all the time.

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.880
They do bring that access token to the app.

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.320
They do that secure exchange that we talked about earlier on.

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:19.700
So Facebook now is a trusted provider for my identity into the new system, which reduces

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:20.440
the amount of passwords.

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.960
But if you use the right tools, like a password manager out there, then I don't think that

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:24.520
should be an issue.

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.280
So I agree.

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:31.660
The danger is like, you're not going to have your password dumped on have I been pwned and

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.160
like haste bin and other random places.

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:38.800
If it gets hacked, if you use say face, let's just pick Facebook login, use Facebook.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.620
But if you authorize 50 different websites with Facebook and your Facebook account gets

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:43.900
hacked.

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.420
Yes.

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:48.820
All of a sudden, like you've got a list of these are all the apps that you also can use

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.060
if you break into this one, right?

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:52.860
So there's like this, there's a bigger wall.

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:57.340
But if you scale it, there's a larger pile of goodies for the hackers to get ahold of on

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.360
the far side of it.

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:03.880
I tend to fall on the side of I might use a social login, but I usually create a username

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:08.640
and password either first if the site supports it or after I've done a social login.

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:13.440
Because that way, like I deleted my Facebook account the other day and then I had to create

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.620
it again, which was really made me sad.

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:19.060
But like, but me and my old account is totally gone.

00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.760
And so anything that I had authorized there would be gone.

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:25.300
And Facebook's also a little bit of different of an identity provider because there are a

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.680
lot of apps that are a little bit malicious because you get a lot of data on Facebook.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:32.880
And so for a while, it was sort of the wild west of, oh, you can sign in with your Facebook

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.320
account.

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:37.140
And then I'm also going to pull your friends list and your photos and all these extra things.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.080
Yes, exactly.

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.000
So, you know, it's our privacy policies.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.020
We work with this.

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:47.360
Oh, God, in the UK, but there's like some analytics.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.340
Yeah, I don't know.

00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:52.560
I mean, I forgot the name of the cup, but the whole one that around the DNC and not the DNC

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:56.420
hack, but like, oh, yeah, Cambridge, the one that happened like around there.

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:56.800
Yeah.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.900
Cambridge Analytica.

00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:59.240
Yes, Cambridge Analytics.

00:58:59.240 --> 00:58:59.500
Yes.

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.300
Yeah, we just we don't share much.

00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.200
We just share a little data with them and it's going to be fine.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:03.720
Just a little.

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:09.360
So, yeah, I mean, I tend to fall on the side of because the big risk with passwords is if

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:13.020
you use the same one over and over again or a variant and somebody gets it from site A,

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:15.620
now they've just unlocked 40 other sites for you.

00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:19.840
But so a password manager with super random accounts kind of removes that.

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.940
So if I get a notification that my password is on.

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:23.300
Yes.

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:24.660
On Troy Hunt's site.

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:28.800
Well, at least I know that password, you know, the blast radius of that password leaking

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.060
was just to that one site because I didn't use it anywhere else.

00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.000
And that's sort of the key.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:33.880
So, yeah.

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:36.100
And you just go change in one place and it's fine.

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:41.880
Like what I usually it's those huge random ones are probably good enough, even though space.

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.720
So I don't know.

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.200
I'm with you.

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:47.160
There's a site that I use periodically and it literally does not allow me to create a

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:47.840
username or password.

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.520
I can only log in with Facebook.

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.880
Oh, yeah, that hurts.

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.340
Wow.

00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:53.520
Sounds like it's time to not use that site anymore.

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.400
And it keeps logging me out.

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.540
And I had been taking the policy that I'm not going to be logged into Facebook on my main

00:59:59.540 --> 00:59:59.820
browser.

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.700
If I want to do Facebook, that's an incognito window to Facebook.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.100
And then I close that down.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:04.360
Right.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:04.700
Yeah.

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:05.140
Good idea.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.840
But now I've got to stay logged in if I go.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.960
I mean, I got to keep logging in and out of Facebook just to go do that thing.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:14.180
But it has these like knock on effects of, well, now like every Facebook pixel and the

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:19.200
Internet is now turned on for me to the extent that my ad blockers are not stopping that.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:19.480
Right.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.780
It's like an arms race.

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:26.040
But it's it frustrates me if that's the only option out there.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.060
Yeah, for sure.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:27.440
Yeah.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:27.980
All right.

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.320
Well, just leave it there, I suppose.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:34.720
I think we're getting definitely long in time here, but been really fun to talk about identity

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.240
and the broader sense with you guys.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:36.820
Absolutely.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:40.860
And it's been a blast being here and talk about identity and how to keep you off the

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:41.100
news.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:41.580
Yeah.

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.400
All right.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.960
Before we get here, if you're going to write some code, I'll just, since there's two, I'll

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.940
just ask the one, although who knows, it might be the same answer.

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:48.320
We'll see.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.660
If you're going to write some code, some Python code, what editor do you use?

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.800
I would probably go with VS Code.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.140
Okay.

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.140
Because I am more comfortable with that.

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.840
I haven't really used bytes or mats and I haven't really done a lot of Python production

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.380
work to say that.

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.420
So that will be the convenient one.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.620
However, we are working with JetBrains these days to actually improve the Azure experience

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.960
inside PyTorch and PyCharm.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.620
Yeah.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:11.780
Yeah.

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.060
PyCharm.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:12.280
Yeah.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:12.560
Awesome.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.000
Really?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:13.520
I didn't know that.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:13.940
That's cool.

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:14.340
Yeah.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.260
So we want to bring it in to everyone.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:16.500
Yeah.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.060
So use the tools that work best for you.

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:19.760
Yeah, absolutely.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.580
John, how about you?

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.060
Do Jupyter notebooks count?

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:22.940
Yeah.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:23.120
Yeah.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:23.820
They absolutely count.

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:24.020
Sure.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:24.740
In the browser.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.040
Yeah.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.180
No, I mean, most of what I've used Python for in the past, probably past 12 months has been

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:35.180
like work in Spark doing like data processing and stream processing, which I kind of love

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.580
it for that because it's so much easier than Scala.

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:42.440
And I tried to do Scala once and I was really quite miserable.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.360
And then I was like, I'll just do this in Python.

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.140
And then a lot of it too, I do use VS Code a lot.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:59.340
And for more sort of like application stuff for doing like Azure automation stuff, like if I want to automate some resources and things like that in Azure or use like AWS Lambda for application stuff, I tend to fall to VS Code.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.100
Excellent.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:00.440
All right.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.280
Well, that's definitely a popular answer these days.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.040
All right.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:03.760
Final call to action.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.040
People are interested in identity.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.340
They want to up their game and their app or maybe they're creating a new app.

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:11.340
They want to try something different, like federated identity or something.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:12.020
What do you say to them?

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:17.840
Do it and come hang out with us on Twitch, come and write some code with us and tell us what you want to see.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.060
Tell us what kind of scenarios you're in that you want to see.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.340
Yeah, we haven't talked about that.

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:24.940
Just really quickly, you guys have a Twitch programming live stream.

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.380
You want to tell folks about that real quick?

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.400
We'll put the link in the show notes.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.020
Sure.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:32.080
It's every Tuesday and Thursday at 7 a.m. Pacific, 10 a.m. Eastern.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.320
And usually Tuesdays, we build something.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:42.320
Right now, we're working on a multi-episode project of building what we're calling the Thrasman, which is the Azure Resource Thrasher, which will be fun.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:46.000
And we take questions from the chat and from the community all the time.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.660
And then Thursdays, we do community hour where we show off a cool project that somebody in the community has been working on.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:59.380
Or we have a guest come on from Microsoft or outside and share with the world what they're working on or something really cool or a big announcement.

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.840
And yeah, it's a lot of fun.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.460
Yeah, cool.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:04.440
I hear you have some Python topics maybe coming up potentially.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.080
We do.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.080
When are you going to come on the show?

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.080
Come build something with us.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:07.660
Oh, yeah.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:08.000
Oh, yeah.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.760
October 20th.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.380
Nice.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:12.640
It's already done.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.200
Agreed.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:13.900
And we're cooking.

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:19.300
So we'll make sure that we promote that and let people know that you're coming to the show to build some awesome authentication stuff with us.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.240
Yeah, that'd be sweet.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.160
Yeah, it sounds good.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.380
We'll do some Flask plus OpenID Connect or something like that.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:25.060
Yes.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:25.860
Awesome.

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:26.580
All right, guys.

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.720
Thank you for being on the show.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.400
It's been a lot of fun.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.260
Thanks for having us.

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:30.340
Thank you for having us.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:31.140
Yeah, Yvette.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:31.780
Talk to you later.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.260
This has been another episode of Talk Python to Me.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.480

I really appreciate it.

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.220
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:59.920
I'll see you next time.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:29.900
