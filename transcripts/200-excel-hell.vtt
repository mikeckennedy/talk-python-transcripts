00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.340
Do you know or maybe work with people who abuse Excel?

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.420
Is it their hammer to pound all the computational problems that get in their way?

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.260
Well, join me to chat about this opportunity to bring Python deeper into their lives.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.660
You'll meet Chris Moffitt, who runs Practical Business Python.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.840
He works with lots of folks who could make better use of Python to solve their business problems

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.440
and has a ton of material on his website focusing on just that.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.080
It's time to escape Excel hell with Python and Pandas.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.200
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 200, recorded January 21st, 2019.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.020
Chris, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.120
Hey, great to be here.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.140
Yeah, it's great to have you here.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.920
You've got some really interesting and amusing presentations around Excel.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.500
And not doing bad things with Excel, but maybe using it when they should use something else like Python or Pandas.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.080
Absolutely.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.060
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.140
I mean, Excel in and of itself probably isn't bad or good, but it's like many things, the only tool that people have.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.880
And sometimes it can be used in ways that cause a lot of pain in the future.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.220
Yeah, it definitely can.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:49.660
You know, if you think of what is the most widely used and deployed databases within companies, like on install per install, it's probably Excel, right?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.360
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.560
Absolutely.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.920
Absolutely.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.260
And I think it's funny.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:00.920
I've talked to other people in the Python community, maybe where they do more like Django development or really deep data science or testing.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.660
And I don't think a lot of people understand how pervasive Excel is and how it's used for everything.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.720
And the idea that you just replace Excel is really a non-starter at most organizations.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.560
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.380
It's pretty crazy.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:22.180
And it's going to be fun to talk about, you know, taking people on that journey, maybe saying like, look, you could dip your toe in this programming world.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.180
Like, you don't have to want to be a developer, but do you know how much better your life would be if you could learn like an if statement and a while loop and a few function calls?

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.580
Like, it would be a lot better, right?

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.780
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.640
And especially some of the things that power users do in Excel, it is programming.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.740
I mean, they don't maybe think about it that way, but it is.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.540
And I kind of talk about if you can write a nested if statement in Excel, you can probably program Python.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.140
Yeah, because if statements in Excel are painful.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.240
Before we get to that, yeah, before we get to that, because it all fits on one line with no organization or structure.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.000
Exactly.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.280
I've read some myself.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.180
So before we get to that, though, let's just start with your story.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.540
How did you get into programming and Python?

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.000
Sure.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.180
So I grew up in the early 90s.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.760
So my Apple IIc was first computer and studied, learned basic and actually learned Pascal in high school.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.280
And then in college, I studied computer science and electrical engineering.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.640
So I, you know, learned C, C++, kind of the traditional computer science curriculum at the time.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.980
Really enjoyed it.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.540
But when I graduated, I took a job where I didn't actually use any of it.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.680
So some of those skills kind of atrophied a little bit.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.500
And fortunately, throughout my career, as I've moved to other roles, I've been in typically a little bit more business type roles.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.540
But I've been able to use my technical skills to try and solve problems.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.360
So that's been kind of my evolution over the past many years that I've been doing this.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.720
Interesting.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:04:03.480
So what is your impressions and experiences of being this little more on the business side of things, but having that technical skill and looking at other people, trying to solve problems manually, copy paste, like no version.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.880
I'm just like looking at them going, do you know how much easier this could be?

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.960
Like, what are you doing?

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.140
Right.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.780
Is that sort of something that you encounter often?

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.280
Absolutely.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.720
Yeah.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.340
That's definitely one of the biggest challenges is you mentioned something like version control.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.240
One of those things that is just once you start using it and get used to it, not having it is just extremely painful.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.340
But most people who don't program really don't use version control.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.380
They haven't used GitHub or Bitbucket or even SVN back in the day.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:42.040
When you see how manual things are, how people try and rename files as the poor man's versions control, it is painful.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.380
It is very painful.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:54.580
And I've had to think a lot about how do you approach that problem and not just tell people, oh, there's a better way to do it and just scrap everything you're doing and move to my way.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.900
Right.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.580
How do you help them make a few steps?

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:05.820
So if renaming the files, having like Excel report May version 3 is like version 3 Kennedy or something like this, right?

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.100
Exactly.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.020
Like a weird naming scheme.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.480
If that is the version control, then Outlook probably is GitHub, right?

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.740
Like so you attach it to an email and it's like it's kept live in like this thread of email with the different versions in there, right?

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.220
Absolutely.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:31.140
It's either Outlook or it's in the file share buried somewhere in multiple, you know, nested file subfolders that are impossible for anyone to actually find or understand.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.740
Absolutely.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.140
Yeah.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.740
And, you know, I think a lot of people either work independently or they work at like small companies.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.700
But the larger the company, the more this like the more people copied on those email threads.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.980
There's like 20 people and they all have their little tweaks in versions.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.080
And it's crazy, right?

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.580
It is.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:06:02.060
And it's so frustrating because you want to just say, hey, can't we just put the data set in one place and we're all working off of it and using version control just like you would in an open source project that the concept just isn't there.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:12.020
And I mean, there are some tools, some of the more recent Microsoft tools support it a little bit, but it's still not, at least in my experience, doesn't seem to be as common as you would expect.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.300
Yeah.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:20.840
A lot of times what the answer seems to be at these big organizations is like, well, this Outlook named thing as version control sucks.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.400
So let's use SharePoint, which is like its own special type of hell.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.760
Yes.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.560
You know, I haven't used SharePoint a lot, mainly because I've heard, you know, it's its own special type of hell.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.580
And I think now Microsoft Teams is the new thing, but I haven't used that enough to really figure it out because it is.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:45.040
It's a lot of time and energy figuring out how to use it and then to get the people you're working with to use it as well.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.300
Yeah.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.580
Let me see if I can summarize my SharePoint experience.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.180
Like, oh yeah, that's on the shared SharePoint project site.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.540
Okay.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.960
Where is that?

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.380
And eventually someone will send me a link and then I'll click on it and it'll say access denied.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.680
And I'll say, oh, you never gave me access to that part of the project.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.500
Oh, and they'll come back and then they'll give me access to it.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.800
And then you can like check out the file, which downloads it and locks other people from checking it out.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.640
But, you know, maybe someone's already checked it out and forgotten it.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.580
So you can't get it.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.040
It's just like, what are we doing?

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.420
Like, this is crazy, man.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.340
Yeah.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.460
So it's really frustrating those things.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.660
Yeah.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:18.960
Yeah.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:26.440
I've had similar experiences as a user just trying to get it to work and it just didn't seem like it was worth the effort at the time.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.180
Yeah, for sure.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:34.560
So you've started Practical Business Python, this project to sort of help take people along, right?

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.460
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:35.840
Sure.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:42.400
So I've always kind of, you know, had a little bit of that technical itch that I wanted to scratch.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.820
And I did some Django development back in the day.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.820
And after a while, for multiple reasons, I wasn't doing that as much.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.060
And so I felt like, you know, I just didn't have that much going on.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:05.400
And probably, I think in 2014, I decided, you know, I'd like to do something else to get that technical information out there, to keep my skills up, to share with others.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.420
But I didn't want to embark on a huge open source project, something that I was going to have to maintain.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.300
So I thought, you know what?

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.280
I'll do a blog, get this started.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.180
And it's funny.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:21.080
Originally, I thought I was going to spend more time talking about, like, Raspberry Pi, Internet of Things type work.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:33.180
But as I started getting into it, that's when the whole data science thing, or I guess probably when I started learning more about data science, and then learned about Pandas and those tools and started applying them to the problems I had.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.340
And it was just like, wow, this is really cool.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.740
I got to learn a lot, got a lot of really positive feedback from folks.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.840
So it was really exciting.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.460
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.880
And Pandas is nice because it solves a lot of those problems automatically, right?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.240
It'll read a CSV directly, and it'll kind of let you sort and things like that.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:58.920
It has a lot of the features at the code level that other people might need at the, you know, Excel or GUI level, right?

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.020
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:15.260
And I think one of the things that really sold me on Pandas, I had done in my role, I identified one process that was just extremely manual, a lot of work that it would take to build this report essentially on a monthly basis.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:22.560
And going back to, you know, when you only know one tool, everything looks or when you only know how to use a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.480
So I decided I was going to build my data processing thing using Django.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.200
So Django admin and Django ORM, and I put it together.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.020
And it worked.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.680
I mean, but it was slow.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.880
So I would do this, I would kick this process off, and it would take maybe an hour to run.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.900
But it was an hour I could go to lunch, get coffee, whatever.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.900
So it was no big deal, and it worked well.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:55.660
Eventually, once I learned Pandas and got over that learning curve, and then I solved the same exact problem in Pandas on the same exact hardware, and it took like two minutes to run.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.820
That's incredible.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:02.540
So it's, you know, just Pandas because it uses NumPy and all the lower level functions written in C.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.100
And if you do things right, it's pretty quick.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:13.080
And so once I kind of had that experience, I'm like, okay, there's no reason we can't use some of these tools to solve some of the problems we have right now.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.100
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.540
And, you know, Pandas, its origins, a lot of people think of it around data science.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.540
So maybe they think machine learning, they think science, but it really comes from the financial industry.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:28.460
And it's probably got its roots right from Excel, more or less, right?

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.340
Like right near there.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.900
Exactly.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:47.880
And if you start, you know, kind of looking around at Pandas, there's a lot of things around time series and grouping of data that are just really, like you said, really kind of from the finance world and are very applicable to a lot of the kind of common problems that people use Excel for in many large organizations.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.320
Yeah.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.160
So I was looking over your blog and all the articles you've written.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.400
There's a ton of resources there.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.600
It looks like you've been at this for quite a while.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.560
And you said you use the Feynman learning technique, as in Richard Feynman, the physicist, right?

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.120
Yes.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.600
What's the story there?

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:02.900
Yeah.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:08.360
Well, I certainly didn't start off doing this, but this is something I don't remember when I first learned about it.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:16.840
But basically, the idea is you take some sort of concept, you learn it, and then figure out how to teach it to someone that really doesn't know anything.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.320
Now, Feynman talks about teaching it to a toddler.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.280
Certainly, my articles aren't at the toddler level.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:37.880
But by going through and actually writing a blog post and understanding it at the level of detail that you need to to write a post and put it out there on the internet, it really does force you to kind of have this feedback loop that he talks about where you think you understand something.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.100
But once you try and put it in a blog post, you realize, ooh, I didn't understand it as well as I thought I did.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.740
And so then you kind of loop back.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:50.660
And by the time you're done actually writing a good post, what I find is, you know, I really understand the concept pretty well.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.920
And that's what I try and do with the blog post is get it out there so that others can learn.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.580
Yeah, it's interesting.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:13.800
You see these polished blog posts or conference presentations or even online courses, and you're like, that person so deeply knows this stuff that they're teaching me this, that it's great I got this article or this video or whatever, but how am I ever going to reach that level?

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:20.600
And the reality is probably that person who did that presentation went on that journey as part of creating this thing, right?

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:29.500
Like they may have not known very much at the beginning, but they kind of applied this technique knowingly or unknowingly to just go like, I am interested.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.280
I know a little.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.540
I'm going to just dig in and like really put it together.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.100
Absolutely.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:43.020
And I think the funny thing is I was actually working on a post this morning where I'd written it a couple of years ago and the API, Pandas API has changed, so I need to update it.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.720
And I like had to really go back and figure out what I had done.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:55.660
And I know people have talked about this before about there's got to be some name for when you have a problem and you Google it and it's a blog post that you wrote and forgot about.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.300
I mean, it happens to me all the time.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.720
I was just thinking of that.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.280
Like I've had that problem happen to me as well.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.240
Where I'm like, gosh, I really don't remember how this works.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.080
I know I did something with it a while ago and I Google it and the best answer is something that I've done.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.040
I'm like, oh, I'm all hope is lost.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.060
Yes, exactly.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.760
If this is at the top and I don't remember it, we're kind of done here.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.420
Yeah.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.880
No, but it's a really good point.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:25.660
I mean, I think this is a it's very easy for new users to get discouraged because it is a lot to learn.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.440
And I think it's really important.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.480
You do a great job on your show with the other guests and letting people know that we're all human.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.640
We're all trying to learn.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:40.540
And some of this stuff seems to slip out of your brain over time and you have to continually relearn it.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:40.720
Right.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:47.680
Well, at the same time, like so much stuff is changing that you have to eject some stuff to make room for it.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:47.840
Right.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.360
And it's a matter of can I go back and Google that thing or do I really need to force myself to remember it?

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:53.640
Right.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.220
Like a lot of times it's like I have it written down or I have an example.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.240
Let's kind of just sort of forget that and really focus on this new library.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:01.500
Right.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:08.520
Like I want to learn Altair for graphing and I'm just going to forget the Matlab plot live API for a while because, you know, this is what I want to focus on.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:08.640
Right.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.060
There's just so much new knowledge.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.200
It's like this constant battle for cognition, basically.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.640
Right.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:13.920
Right.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.240
Absolutely.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:21.520
And I think at the end of the day, that's a lot of what I'm trying to do at the blog is not so much teach people to understand everything,

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.660
but it's almost teaching them what is possible.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:28.560
So it's showing the tools that are out there and saying, here are the types of problems.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:35.700
And here is a way to sort of present the problem, maybe in a way that will apply to what you're working on today.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:35.980
Sure.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:41.100
And so what are some of the more popular topics or things that have come across on the blog that people liked?

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.020
It's interesting.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:52.860
So one of the things I've learned in writing the blog is it is very hard to gauge what is going to be popular when you publish it and what's going to live on through the magic of Google search engines.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:15:02.040
And so some of the articles seem really popular in the beginning, but then hardly ever pop up in searches and don't get much traffic.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:10.620
And then others that seem to maybe be a little less exciting are the ones that tend to pop up on Google.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.100
So one of the most popular articles for a while was my pandas pivot table.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.580
I really enjoyed that one.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.400
I think that one was a good example where I felt like it was going to be popular.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.000
People enjoyed it.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.940
It was, I included, I think, a good summary of how to use the pandas pivot table.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.580
And that was really popular.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.500
The one that surprised me is the pandas data type article.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.360
So I explained how to use the different pandas data types.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.120
And that is one of my most popular Google search items right now.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.020
So, you know, I just can't quite figure it out.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:49.820
You know, sometimes I think about it and then other times I'm just like, well, you know, I'm going to write what I think people want.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.460
And sometimes they're hit and sometimes they're not.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.000
Yeah, it's a really tricky thing to try to guess that, right?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.280
You just kind of got to throw it out there and let the world decide what they're interested in.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:04.260
Because I've done that with blogging where I'm thought, I'll just throw this out, like whatever, I got to spare 20 minutes.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.460
And other times I'll spend a whole day writing something really polished.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.260
And I'm like, this is going to be the good one.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.560
And, you know, it's like kind of like, meh, people don't care.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.980
The one I threw together is like super popular.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.580
I'm like, if I knew it was going to be popular, I would put more effort into it.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.660
Same thing with videos on YouTube.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.640
Same thing with even the Talk Python episodes, right?

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.200
Some are like, oh, this could be super popular.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.840
I'm not sure people are going to love that one.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.660
And it, you know, it's all over the map.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.400
Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.160
And I think I've talked about this on some of your prior podcasts.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.220
Like as technical people, we're not necessarily good marketers.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.020
You know, we kind of expect all this content to stand on its own.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.100
The world's a meritocracy.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.960
If I make it well, it's just going to be fine.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.040
And like, that's just, it would be cool if that were true.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:46.540
It's not.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.140
It's not.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:47.720
It's not.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.860
And so that's one of the things, you know, I don't do a whole lot of promoting old articles.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.520
And I do wonder if, you know, should I do that?

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.860
Should I kind of remind people, hey, here's something I wrote two years ago that's still,

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.280
applicable.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:04.300
It's not something I do, but I think it should be done to really kind of keep this stuff fresh

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.480
and remind people what's out there.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:05.760
Right.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.040
It's not a bad idea.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.580
I mean, one of the ways to promote anything like a blog or courses or videos or whatever

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.120
is to just keep making new stuff that's exciting.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.060
And some of it will like not be as exciting as you thought it would.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.040
Some of it will be more and it'll draw people in.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:26.180
And then they'll find like, just keeping your profile high will help your older stuff stay

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:26.600
relevant.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.020
Right.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.720
But there's also ways you could continue to promote them.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:29.880
Right.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.320
Like more explicitly for sure.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.000
Sure.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.280
And it is funny.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.980
I mean, you kind of, I kind of forget, like once I've got an article out there and there's

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.720
kind of that initial bump for the first couple of weeks while people are discovering it.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.540
And then I almost forget about it.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:49.200
But it is amazing when someone will stumble upon an article that's three or four years

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.400
old and it solves the exact problem and they leave a comment or send me an email or reach

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.040
out and say, hey, Chris, that was awesome.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:55.420
Thanks.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.740
You saved me dozens of hours of time.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.400
And so, you know, it feels good.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.180
And it's good to remember that that's going on as well.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:02.480
Yeah.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.080
The long tail is definitely up.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.880
Exactly.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.240
Yeah.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.660
So let's dig into a little bit of this Excel hell story, right?

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.480
Like you did a great presentation and we'll link to the slides, the PDF of the slides in

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.780
the show notes that you talk about, like basically what is Excel hell and what is Python and Pandas?

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:25.280
And it's a pretty good synopsis for folks who are presenting to a business audience.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:25.660
Sure.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:31.480
Excel hell in my mind is when you have a problem, it's a legitimate problem.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:39.280
You're trying to solve at work in your business setting and you've solved it using Excel and

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.860
then you go back and try and figure out what you did.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:49.440
And it's impossible to recreate what you've done or impossible to just like tweak it slightly

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.560
to use it for a new problem.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:57.040
It's just the kind of like pain you feel once you open up something you worked on six months

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.920
ago in Excel and try and recreate it and understand what in the world did I do?

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.740
Where were my data sources?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.620
What's the most recent version?

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.320
You know, what have I changed?

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.660
I mean, that in my mind is what Excel hell is.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:10.920
Yeah.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:16.200
Does it involve maybe like when you open up the worksheet that the app kind of goes like

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.960
gray or white?

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.460
Cause it's like not responding for a while cause something's happening in there.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:20.920
Yeah.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.500
I mean, there's certainly one where you're like, I think that's the challenge with Excel

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.160
is there are so many different ways you can interact with the data.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:36.180
So you can have formulas, you can have VBA behind the scenes, you can have multiple tabs,

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.740
you can have linked workbooks.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.760
And so when you open one, there's really no way to figure out what is going on.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.920
How did the data get there?

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.620
What manipulations have been made?

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.840
How is this supposed to be used?

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.160
It's just it.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.880
People underestimate how challenging it is to decipher the, you know, the complexities of

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.660
a big Excel workbook.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:56.840
Yeah.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:02.560
And the reason you get there is because these problems land in this like weird middle ground,

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:02.880
right?

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.960
Like they're not big enough to bring in like the software team to build a custom solution.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:13.600
There's probably not a SAS solution that's like immediately obvious out there, but it's,

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.480
it's beyond just data, right?

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.160
It's like, it has to make some decisions.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:23.620
And as soon as the conditionals start to appear in there, it starts to seem like, well, you're

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:28.020
taking that first step down that slope is like, now here's where the if statements are in the

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.340
table.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.280
And you're like, okay, here we go.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:30.960
Exactly.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.640
Exactly.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:38.520
And then there are so many cases of like when you're doing it and you like have a VLOOKUP

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.940
formula and you forget to copy it down or, you know, you have the ranges wrong.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:48.580
I mean, there are just so many types of formulas, so many types of interactions that seem seductively

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:54.360
easy, but just set you up where it's so easy to make a mistake and so hard to troubleshoot

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:54.900
it when you do.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.160
Yeah.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.580
I mean, if you miscopied a formula, right?

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.540
Like it's, how do you look at that thing and go, yeah, okay.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.240
Especially if it's spanning multiple sheets, like it can be a beast.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:03.880
Exactly.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.400
Exactly.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.140
And then, you know, like we were talking about earlier, the whole version control mess.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:14.600
I mean, there, there is no way to just do or no easy way to do a diff of the code and the

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.120
spreadsheets to understand what's changed and why did it change and very painful.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.360
Right.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.860
Certainly direct version control won't help you.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.000
Right.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.700
Cause it's like, it's, I think it's an XML file that is the source file of Excel, but it's

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.260
like zipped.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:32.680
So you can't actually diff the code or you can't, it's like if they just left it unzipped effectively,

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.040
like at least you could diff it.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:34.300
Right.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:34.720
Right.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.940
But no, yeah.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.480
All hope is lost.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.860
This portion of talk Python to me is brought to you by Linode.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.640

you'll get native SSDs on all the machines, a newly upgraded 200 gigabit network, 24 seven

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.500
friendly support, even on holidays, and a seven day money back guarantee.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.100
Need a little help with your infrastructure.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.840
They even offer professional services to help you with architecture, migrations, and more.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.780
Do you want a dedicated server for free for the next four months?

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.860
Just visit talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:36.620
And then, you know, and we talked about like coming from a programming background.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:42.300
I mean, even if you just had a little bit of experience, the idea of an if statement, an

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.740
if then else, or a case statement, or switch statement, you know, or defining functions, all

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.440
is fairly straightforward.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:55.740
But when you try and cram all of that into a single Excel cell, you know, trying to, like

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.180
we said, trying to do a nested if statement is just impossible.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:02.280
I mean, it is very, very hard to do and understand it.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.660
And I think anyone that's worked with Excel has opened up these spreadsheets and you click

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.660
on the tab or on a cell.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:15.240
And there's just this massive formula with all these parentheses and all this kind of error

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:15.720
catching.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.240
And you're like, how, how can I understand if this is even right?

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.200
How can I troubleshoot it?

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.800
It's yeah.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.820
So that's Excel hell in my mind.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.040
Sounds about right.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:33.400
I think for the purpose of this discussion, it sounds like it's more or less the same situation

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.940
if like you're actually using Google Sheets or some other technically another tool than Excel,

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.240
but something Excel like, right?

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.540
Yes, absolutely.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.260
I mean, I think there are some things that Google Sheets makes a little bit better.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:50.020
I think, and I'm not a huge Google Sheets user, but it does kind of the versioning automatically

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.260
and seeing the history, I think is a little bit better.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.620
And one of the things I think Google Sheets does better is it's easier to share.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:03.500
So if two people are working in it at one time, that works better than Excel, where it just

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.740
locks the file and you have to yell at your coworker to get out, that kind of thing.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.720
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.400
It is a little better there for sure, but it's also simpler.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.880
So maybe you can't push it as far, right?

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.260
You can't get as far down that hole before you have to like scream for mercy.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.180
Right, right.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:18.420
Yeah.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:23.620
I haven't dived into Google Sheets to see like how complex can you do the formulas?

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.640
I know it doesn't have VBA, but I'm sure you can program it behind the scenes.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:35.140
I'm sure someone's done something pretty crazy, but I think just Excel is just so pervasive

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.100
and so misused in organizations.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:44.400
Well, thankfully, both Excel and Google Sheets have Python packages that'll let you work on

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.160
them, which we'll get to.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:45.900
Yes, exactly.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.880
Exactly.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.460
Yeah.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.860
Let's start with the question of like, why is Python better than Excel, right?

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.720
Especially from the perspective of somebody who's like a power user, but they don't consider

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.020
themselves a programmer.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.980
Like they wouldn't pick up code and think that that's okay for them.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.400
Like that's for someone else, you know?

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.120
Right, right.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.660
There's a couple of things.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.220
One of them is Python.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:11.880
And when you use these tools are going to encourage a little bit better practice.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.200
So it's more reproducible.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:20.600
So you can look at a Python script and even if it's the newest of newbies and it's maybe

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.640
not the most Pythonic, you can at least step through it and understand what's going on.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:31.100
And if you've maybe put some comments in there or used a Jupyter notebook to capture some of

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:36.320
this information, there is like some reproducibility built into that.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.640
And you can step through it and see what's happening.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:45.020
And you can see, oh, I'm taking data A and data B and data C and I'm joining them together

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:49.440
and I'm cleaning them and I'm doing all these types of things that a program, it's going

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.460
to be fairly straightforward how this is happening in what order.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.180
Whereas Excel just by its very nature doesn't do that.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:02.800
It's super hard to even look in an Excel workbook and go, these are the parts where code is.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.800
Like you can't even see the code.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.520
You got to go touch every little cell to see, is this a formula?

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.420
Is this a value?

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.240
What other, it's like not linear, it's circular, it's cross sheet.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.540
It's, it's a little bit like VB with go-to.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:15.860
Yes.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.200
You know?

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.460
It's a lot of go-to statements.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.340
That's, that's a very good way to put it.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.700
Like a, like a two-dimensional go-to.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:33.180
One of the other problems with Excel is I do think it lends itself to some bad practices.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.700
So it is very easy in Excel to edit the data, right?

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:42.960
If you pull in some data and a cell has the wrong value, you can just go in there and type it and fix it.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.020
Well, the problem is next time you pull the data, you don't know that you just fixed it.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.100
It's all live.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:56.480
So by having a program, you at least have to be more conscious in Python about changing a value.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.700
You certainly can, but you have to make a very explicit choice to do that.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:00.960
Right.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:06.060
If you somehow pulled a data source and dropped it in there, but then you tweaked it or you, yeah, then that's right.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.180
You're like, you never know.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.540
There's no history or artifact that says that this happened.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.960
Exactly, exactly.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:19.740
And then I think, you know, outside of the just overall benefits of having a program that's a text file that you can version control and understand,

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.740
I think that the biggest benefit is you have access to all of the Python ecosystem.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:37.760
So all of the libraries, everything that's out there, whether it's data science or a web scraping or, you know, any of the thousands of things you can do with Python, you actually have access to it.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:44.140
Whereas even Excel, as you start to get into VBA, you can certainly do more.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:51.480
But if you wanted to go parse an XML file or scrape a web page, you can probably do it.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.860
But there's going to be a lot better ways to do it in Python.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.860
Yeah, sure.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.440
To try to calm object in C++ and distribute that, you'll be fine.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.240
Yeah, exactly.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.940
Exactly.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:02.440
Yeah.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.680
That just sounds horrible.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.820
I don't want to go anywhere near that.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.080
Yeah.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:05.420
Yeah.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.640
And obviously that's out of reach of the people who actually want to do those things, right?

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:08.880
Right.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.800
So I think you're right.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.680
Like the ability to acquire and keep the data up to date, right?

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:21.380
Like I'm going to use Beautiful Soup and Request to go grab this table off our internal intranet every day.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:27.000
So when I make the report, it automatically starts with absolutely fresh data and things like that, right?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.320
Right.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:27.900
Absolutely.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:38.000
And then my experience has been no matter how clean the data is, someone wants the report a little bit different or you need to apply some sort of business logic to clean it up.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:44.020
And if you have been doing that by hand and then you forget to do it, everybody gets upset.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:50.940
So then you can put it in Python, you can code it there and say, this translation always needs to happen and it's there.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.480
And then people don't get upset when it's missing.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:29:02.580
So there's just so many benefits to like having that repeatable record of what you've done with the data analysis.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:02.980
Yeah.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:12.060
We'll touch more on this later, but just having the ability to press a button and have the answer without going, what are the seven manual steps I got to do?

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.540
And I hope I don't forget them.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.400
And, oh, I'm on vacation next week.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:22.540
And Sarah, who's never done this, it's her job to do those seven steps and just even have access to like, oh, my goodness.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:22.720
Right.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.520
Like, so just having this repeatable alone is pretty valuable.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.200
Absolutely.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:27.780
Absolutely.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:37.980
And then the other thing I'd say is I think it is interesting that Excel, as powerful as it is, it's pretty easy to get a data set that just doesn't work in Excel.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:44.300
So if you get a couple hundred thousand rows in Excel starting to try and manipulate it, it starts to slow down.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.560
It'll bog down your system.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:51.280
Whereas if you read that data into Pandas and do the manipulations, it's pretty fast.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:58.420
As long as you can fit it in memory, you can manipulate a lot of data in Pandas that would be difficult to manipulate in Excel.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.420
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:04.680
And there's limits, actual limits to how much data Excel will accept, like a million rows or something, right?

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.020
Yes, absolutely.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:13.960
And, you know, it does keep going up and you can have more rows and more columns, but it doesn't mean you can actually work with it when it's in there.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.700
Yeah, that's a different story also.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.160
But, yeah, cool.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.720
And then also, it's like you say, it's a proper language, right?

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.540
If you learn to work with Excel, you can make really complicated Excel sheets.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:34.880
You learn to work with Python, all of a sudden, you start to see these other problems like, oh, I always copy these files from here to there and I always make these little edits to them.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.940
Or I always, you know, have to grab this data and transform it that way.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:45.320
And, like, it's sort of a good way to draw them into this automate your world space, right?

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.340
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:55.900
And then that's the thing that is nice about it is the internet loves to have language wars and we could fight about whether the Python is really the best language for the task.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.400
But in most places, it's going to be a pretty good choice.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.480
It may not be the best.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:09.980
So, if you have learned Python and then you expand and start doing something a little bit more than just the Excel manipulations you're doing, you're not going to have to relearn a bunch of things.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:17.960
You're not going to be going down a path where you've got to make a huge course correction at some point in your career if you decide to continue developing that skill.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.020
The hard part about learning programming is not learning the Python syntax, right?

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.120
Like, that's not so hard.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.800
It's like, what is a loop?

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.040
When do I use loops?

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:27.940
What is a conditional?

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.100
What is a data type?

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.040
What data types are?

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.180
Like, that's basically the same across all the languages, right?

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:33.460
Exactly.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:37.560
It's just like, I need curly braces and parentheses and why are there semicolons everywhere, right?

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.120
But still, like, it's no big deal, right?

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:39.420
Yeah.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.100
Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:40.800
Absolutely.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:41.560
Yeah, interesting.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:51.960
So, one of the things that I keep repeating is we don't need 100 million software developers, but we do need people who can do whatever they do better, right?

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:59.840
And I feel like software development, a little bit of it, like the kind you're talking about, can really amplify whatever you're good at anyway, right?

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:13.040
So, from this context, you know, maybe who people are listening, they're probably developers, but they probably work at companies where they get asked to help with Excel sheets or they have these automation problems that, like, start from Excel.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:20.800
Who should they go start going, I know I could write this for you, but let me help you learn to automate your world a little bit.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.660
Like, what type of folks should be reaching out to?

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:34.180
So, I feel like there is, anytime you have a group of people that use Excel, and I don't know what the number is, but five to ten people, it seems like there's always someone that's like the Excel super user.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.320
So, it may be...

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.020
Probably there's color, a lot of color in there, some formulas, right?

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.480
Exactly, exactly.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.620
Now, definition of super user is going to vary.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.760
I mean, sometimes it could be someone that is really good at some pretty complex VBA.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.940
It could just be the person that understands how to put a pivot table together.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:33:01.900
But I think in any group where you have people that are doing repeatable type processes, there is someone that is the de facto expert.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:15.760
And that is the person that I would target and kind of say, okay, let's take a look at what you're doing here and see if there's an alternative to use this tool called Python to improve this process.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.200
You raise a really good point.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:25.020
And I think one of the big challenges here is these people aren't going to say, I want to learn programming.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.520
To them, it's like, I can't learn programming.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.680
I need to go to a university and get a four-year degree.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:42.520
And I would encourage the people that are listening, if they do have that Python knowledge, to kind of help ease them into that and say, you know what, you don't have to be a computer scientist to do this.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:49.240
Let me show you some of the simple things that you can do in Python to help with this process and get them started.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.820
And so, yeah, focusing on those kind of natural experts in the group.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:54.920
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:34:07.440
And the fact that Python is not a compiled to machine instructions with a compiler and linker type of language means you don't have to drag them through the sort of software, computer science-y tool chain.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.080
You can just say you write this in a text file, preferably in a proper editor that helps you with spaces.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:13.740
Exactly.

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:14.560
And autocomplete.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.720
And then you're kind of good, right?

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.040
Yeah.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.080
You raise a good point.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:24.440
I think these, if you are a Python expert, you should be able to help get Python set up on their system.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.160
And I know you've talked about this before.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:35.200
It is much easier than it used to be back in the past, but it's still a non-trivial activity for someone that's not comfortable with this.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:44.260
I mean, I've had experiences where I've deployed some Python scripts and told people, okay, open a command prompt on your Windows system and type Python file name.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.760
And they, you know, it just kind of blows their mind a little bit.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.480
They're just not used to that.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.380
Most people don't, you know, type commands on their laptop.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.200
So that is a, exactly.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.620
Like they maybe don't know what the command prompt is at all.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.240
Exactly.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:34:59.940
It's very possible.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:00.540
Exactly.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:09.040
And when you're talking Excel and you're talking business users and you're intersecting those two things, there's a good chance that that intersection lands on Windows and not Mac.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.100
It's very unlikely it's on Linux, right?

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:11.620
Absolutely.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.200
Yes.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:20.320

Or just click the link in your show notes in your podcast player.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:24.000
What are the recommendations for making that work?

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Like Anaconda, things like this, or what do you suggest there?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.840
I'm a big fan of the Anaconda distribution.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:36.420
I tend to use Miniconda, so that's the more stripped-down version that has just not all of the libraries.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.500
Getting that installed on the system, it doesn't take as much space.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:45.140
And then adding in Pandas and all the other Jupyter notebooks and pieces that you need.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:52.460
My experience has been that it works really well on Windows, and that's probably the easiest way to get started.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:56.160
Python on Windows is getting better, especially if they have Windows 10, right?

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.860
There's some pretty good stuff that's happening.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:01.600
Like you heard about Microsoft embracing Python more, right?

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.540
We had Steve Dower on the show recently.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.060
He's one of the core devs at Microsoft.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:12.520
And he talked about how he got Python 3 in the Windows store, which I think is a big deal for business users.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.020
Absolutely.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:30.100
And then, you know, the other challenge, you've got this challenge of how do you get the users, but then there is kind of this internal corporate IT challenge some places where laptops could be pretty locked down, and you don't have administrative rights, and you can't actually install programs.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:35.260
I really am excited to see Microsoft's embrace of Python.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.120
And, you know, it's really funny to me.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.540
I think of Microsoft, you know, 20 years ago, and it was the evil empire and embrace and extend and extinguish.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.920
But now, I mean, they're really doing some great things.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.820
And what they're doing with Python, I think, is really good.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:57.940
And I think that really plays it well for these types of roles where people are using Excel and now Python, I think, truly is a legitimate option for them.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:58.640
Yeah, I do, too.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:09.220
And I think a lot of the lack of requiring admin rights, like, say, if you go in and you change your path or even just like techie, there's not even necessarily an admin operation, right?

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:15.040
You could do that for your user profile, but go to the Windows Store, type Python, click that, and it's already in your path.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.660
You've already got Python, and Python 3 is a command, right?

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.240
Like, that's another hurdle that they erased there.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.000
Exactly.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.020
It's pretty excellent.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:26.420
If the IT department starts to get upset about it, you can at least say, well, it is in the Windows Store.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.940
It's not like something that is just wild and free on the internet.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.300
Right.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:37.080
It's like, I didn't get that from some weird, like, mirroring site of, like, an open source link.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.020
And it looks super sketchy, but it is linked off of the main project site.

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:43.260
So I'm going to kind of trust, like, it's not that, right?

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:43.780
Exactly.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:47.520
It's not like trying to download Putty from some weird place or social course or something.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.520
And also, it runs with low privileges, right?

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.660
It can't touch the registry.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:56.660
It can't touch the shared file areas, like the one that comes from the store, the Python from the store.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.100
So that's pretty good.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.060
Yes, absolutely.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:38:59.400
Yeah.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.560
But that said, that's a CPython pip world.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.500
That's not a Miniconda, Anaconda world.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.880
Like, would you still recommend people go down the Miniconda side for now?

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:11.600
In my experience, you can install Miniconda without admin, right?

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.640
So you install just as the local user.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:19.760
You know, I don't understand under the hood what the real difference is between that one and the Windows Store version.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.820
But I do know, like, my laptop is fairly well locked down.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.340
And I can install it and run.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.180
And it does everything I need.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.500
I haven't had to mess with the registry or any of the, you know, private Windows files.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.960
But for doing data analysis, replacing Excel files, it seems to work just fine.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.720
Yeah, for sure.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:45.020
So you're talking to these power users, and probably a lot of them, if they're Excel power users, it's very likely that they're kind of higher up in the organization.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:50.300
You know, how much of the conversation goes something like, oh, I should use Python?

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.460
How much is that going to cost us for some corporate licenses to Python?

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.200
And, oh, wait, it's open source.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.340
Should we be using open source?

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.940
Like, is this a conversation that you have to have, or people just kind of brush it off?

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.200
So I think it is a conversation you have to have.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:09.920
And I would say it depends on the organization and your role in the organization, how comfortable you are pushing the boundaries.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:15.060
So if you feel like, you know, if I do this, people are going to be okay with it.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:27.900
But if you're uncomfortable, you know, you definitely need to make sure you talk to the powers that be so that they can provide a little air cover if someone does get upset about bringing in this new Python tool into their ecosystem.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:28.640
Yeah, interesting.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.660
So I think it does help a lot that it's in the Windows store.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:32.980
And then we have Anaconda Inc.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.800
It's like official backers of sort of their distribution.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.980
And it gives it some legitimacy, I would say.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.160
Exactly, exactly.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:39.780
Yeah, all right.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:43.860
So let's suppose the listeners out there are like, I have this Python knowledge.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.440
I don't want to be asked to build another forms over a data app.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.840
I want to help these people do their world without me helping them out.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.260
You know, I want to teach them to fish, basically.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:52.900
How should they get started, right?

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.540
Like, they sit down on Tuesday and they say, hey, let me show you something.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.640
Let me get started.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.460
Like, what do you think?

00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:58.720
Yeah.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.840
Some steps there.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.140
Sure.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:09.140
It is a hard part because there's not just the one place to go to say, hey, here's how you learn Python and the appropriate tools to solve your problem.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:14.320
So what I think works best is people might have the natural reaction.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.240
I want to focus on this really painful problem I have.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.240
It's a really big problem.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.420
It takes a lot of my time.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.680
It's very error prone, whatever.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:36.500
I would say actually start with something that's maybe a little simpler, that's very well understood, and try and automate a simple process and just get the basics down before you move on to the more complex stuff.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:47.300
So maybe there is a process where you're moving some files around or opening up Excel and copying and pasting a few rows or columns from one to another.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:42:02.040
Start with that and just kind of get that going and show them how to set up on their system, how to read in a file, how to make a couple changes with the data frame, with Panda's data frame, save it back out, and just start there.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:09.540
And try and do something in 10 to 20 lines of Python code to get the ball rolling.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.740
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:21.400
And I do think it's these little, almost death by a thousand paper cuts type of problems that if you can just solve some small to medium ones, but they become repeatable.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.180
If they could be scheduled, if they could become automatic.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:30.720
So you just had an email when you came in on Monday instead of you doing the report and sending it to the people who need it.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.280
It just happens automatically and you get a copy on Monday.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.040
Those kinds of things are pretty easy to attack.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:40.220
But I think a couple of those and then the joy would start to spread.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:40.960
You're like, you know what?

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.780
This is awesome.

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.820
What else can I do with this?

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:43.060
Right?

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:43.960
Exactly.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.480
Exactly.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:52.780
And then what I found too is sometimes maybe there's a report that you do once a week, but it's automated now so you could do it daily.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.100
And suddenly people are like, oh, wow, daily.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.260
Yeah, this is really useful.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:00.020
So it's not just the benefits of time savings.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:04.320
It's the benefit of like now it's easy for me to do, so I'll do it.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:12.220
Whereas before, if it took me several hours to pull something together, I'm probably not going to be willing to do that every day just because I don't have the time.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:17.300
So I think there are a lot of unintended benefits of doing automation.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:17.860
For sure.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.740
And like the next step from there is on demand.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.680
Exactly.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:21.820
Right.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:28.120
Like you want to know what the weekly sales rate versus last week were store by store?

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.220
You just click here and then you have it in a minute.

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:30.560
You know?

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.120
Exactly.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:31.640
Exactly.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.620
And you're right.

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.300
I mean, you kind of get this momentum.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.340
It builds on itself.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:41.780
So once you've taken something simple and gotten started, then, oh, I want to tweak it a little bit.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.520
That's where you also see the value is.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.820
I'm not starting from scratch.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:51.740
I can take what's already there and maybe just add some additional code or use that as a basis for a new process.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:44:03.500
It just starts to build and you kind of get this library of tools and ways to manipulate the data and report the data out that just really, you know, accelerate your speed to get things done.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:03.780
Yeah.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:12.520
It's obvious to us as programmers, but if you always have to get the data from one place and maybe you have to do different stuff with it, once you write that part to get the data once, like that is done, right?

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.960
That is a solved problem.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.200
Now you build on top of that capability, right?

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:26.580
And I'm sure a lot of folks that were addressing, you know, like talking about helping them here, they just don't have that mindset of if I solve it in one way, that solution is reproducible and reusable, right?

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:26.960
Right.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.820
And that is a challenge, right?

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:36.200
So anyone that's learning this new tool, they're going to be slower in the beginning and they're going to have to invest time.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:41.540
And, you know, in my experience, I've had to learn a lot of this off hours.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.080
It's not something that you just can get done in an eight hour day.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.420
And so there is a little bit of a targeting of that individual.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:56.720
Is this individual at least open to trying to learn some on their own so we can point them in the right direction and they can learn about Python?

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:03.400
They can learn about these tools, but are they going to be able to follow up on their own or are they just going to say, I need you to do it for me?

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.720
If that's the case, they're probably not the best candidate for this.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:06.980
Right.

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:07.380
Right.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:14.460
I mean, it seems to me like if you're doing some sort of four hour task weekly and there's somebody who's going to help you, they could sit down and say,

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:20.000
instead of doing that manually, why don't we spend those four hours on Monday, build it together?

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.220
I mean, this is not me offering to be your private software developer, but this is me helping you down this path.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.100
I'm sure that we could do this in four hours.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.300
Let's sit down and do it together.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:33.820
So you understand it and then you can take it on and sort of keep it going.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.560
You know, I think things like that may work.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.200
Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:51.180
And then, you know, one of the things that I've wanted to do, but I haven't really done a whole lot of is, you know, what kind of user groups can you set up in your company so that you have some of these resource, peer resources to help them work through the process?

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:59.180
Your podcast about the Apple Python training was really, really interesting and, I mean, certainly a much larger scale than what I'm talking about.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:13.140
But I think that that would be another option is to try and get four or five dozen people like-minded individuals together and over the lunch hour start to introduce these concepts and build a community where they can learn and share their learning.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:27.180
That's a great idea to kind of have all these Excel power users who are escaping Excel through Python start to come together and give a little presentations like, yeah, last week I did this automation and let me just talk to you about how it worked and what I had to overcome.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.200
And yeah, that'd be great.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:28.720
Exactly.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.160
Yeah.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:33.660
And because what I think will happen is there are a lot of common challenges.

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:43.900
You know, how do I get access to this database or how do I massage the data in a certain way that is probably fairly common in an organization?

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:50.520
So if you can share that, you know, or like simple things like I've got to do a lot of PDF file manipulations.

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:50.900
Okay.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.260
What library are you using?

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.220
What are some of the ways to do that?

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:59.520
I think there's a ton of those types of leverageable problems across an organization.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:07.000
As soon as someone finds the solution to getting that table out of that PDF document, other people are like, I have to copy it out of the PDF document.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.620
What are you doing?

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:07.840
Right?

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.460
This is cool.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:09.340
Exactly.

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.000
Exactly.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:10.520
Yeah.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.360
I guess you probably got to set expectations as well, right?

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:20.940
Like you can't say like, look, I know you've got super cool apps on your phone and you've been to Airbnb.com.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.240
This is not what we're talking about.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:34.540
What we're talking about is a few steps reproducibly really quick that you don't like just setting the expectations of you can't start by building, you know, like some kind of super glamorous app.

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.080
Absolutely.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.500
It's a really good point.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:52.620
And that is one of the challenges is the, as much as we rail on Excel and maybe access, which we haven't talked about, but similar sort of thing that, you know, it's still really intuitive for someone new to pick it up and do something.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:48:05.320
And, you know, you can get results and it looks pretty, like you said, whereas are people going to be impressed that I ask you to open up the command prompt and type Python, this, this, and this, and then a file is output somewhere.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:12.360
I mean, it doesn't have that wow factor that you would with more of a, you know, a GUI type application.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:18.560
And so I agree a hundred percent that you need to be able to get people comfortable with what you really can and can't do.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:18.880
Right.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.160
Right.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.340
So it feels like success, not failure when it's working.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:22.640
Right.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.440
Exactly.

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.380
Exactly.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.940
I think there are a few simple things you could do to help.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:37.700
Like right now, as our discussion is gone, like the solution is I go to the command prompt, I type Python, maybe Python through space, the script that does the magic.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:43.700
Maybe I set up a windows task scheduler that does that for, I don't know, some, some way that that thing is running.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:43.880
Right.

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.420
But it's basically a command CLI type of experience.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:57.320
You know, you could use something like GUI, G-O-O-E-Y, which is a really simple way to turn a CLI interface into a GUI cross-platform interface, like a GUI GUI.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:57.520
Yep.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.080
And the other one that you brought up that's pretty straightforward is Jupyter Notebooks.

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:02.500
Yes.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:03.120
Yes.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:03.320
Right.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.160
Do you think that helps a little bit with the acceptance layer?

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.760
Like you can visualize a graph, right?

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.960
You could do a bokeh or matplotlib thing.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:11.720
Absolutely.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:18.720
And it's interesting you mentioned GUI, which, you know, is hard to talk about, but when you see it, you understand what it is.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.120
But I wrote an article about it and I've used it a lot.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:31.080
And it is, I think it's a fabulous tool for people that have, you kind of have this command line and trying to teach people how to use a command line can be frustrating.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:34.320
But GUI, you can just easily put that on top of it.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:40.060
And especially where it's like selecting files, selecting dates, selecting a couple of values from a dropdown.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.140
Got some combo box, exactly.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.200
The dropdowns.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:43.340
Yeah.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:43.780
Exactly.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.680
It's so easy, right?

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.220
It is.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.140
And the other thing is it's WX Windows, so it looks native.

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:52.340
You know, it's not an ugly GUI.

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:58.020
And I personally use that when I put some things together and people just know how to use it.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:03.560
And they don't really care what you did, just that, oh, it looks like I would expect a Windows app to work.

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.660
So that's great.

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:04.980
Yeah.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:07.160
The fact that they have a thing, they double click.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:12.420
If you use Pi Installer or Pi Oxidizer or something, you get like an EXE or a .app file.

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.040
You just, you put it in your doc or your taskbar, you double click it.

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.840
Like all of a sudden, it's almost a first class citizen in your world.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.440
Exactly.

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:19.960
Yeah.

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.300
Yeah.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.100
Totally.

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:24.840
And then Jupyter Notebooks, I think, are certainly another option.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:30.140
I don't have experience with like building a Jupyter Notebook hub that you would share out with everybody.

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:37.760
But I do agree that having that where you tell people, okay, run the notebook, go here in your browser, use some of the widgets to populate some information.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.640
I think that's absolutely a valid option.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:40.960
Yeah.

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.040
It seems like that would really help with the acceptance.

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.900
You're like, okay, this is not so scary.

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:52.560
It's not the terminal or command prompt, which I know in reality, it's like not that big of a deal.

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:56.540
But psychologically, it's a massive deal for some people, right?

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.280
Like they're just like, oh, forget that.

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.260
This is not the way we work here.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.340
This is not the way.

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:01.920
Exactly.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:10.120
And actually, where I see Jupyter Notebook, what I have been trying to do is almost like when I have a data challenge.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.760
So I get an Excel file or I need to do a project.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.540
And I wrote about it on my blog.

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:24.660
I have a cookie cutter that creates like a couple standard Jupyter Notebook directory or directory of some Jupyter Notebooks, stubs, and my in and out directories and the raw data file.

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.420
And so it's a consistent methodology.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:37.500
So I know if I go back six months later and open it up that I have kind of that Jupyter Notebook history of what I've done and all the files are where I expected.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:43.860
And I put notes in there about where the files come from and what am I trying to accomplish and, you know, all those kinds of things.

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:48.360
And I think Jupyter Notebook could really be useful for that type of analysis.

00:51:48.620 --> 00:52:03.460
Instead of in my perfect world, instead of reaching for Excel every time you need to do analysis, hey, I'm just going to use a Jupyter Notebook to start looking at the data and treating it, you know, almost like a data science problem versus I'm just going to, you know, hack together something in Excel.

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:04.100
That's really cool.

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.920
I love the cookie cutter idea as well.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.340
It's nice.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:06.640
Yeah.

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.680
And it's really worked out well.

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:16.140
Once I've started to use it and now I've been using it for a few months and go back and look at projects where I've used the cookie cutter strategy.

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.860
I'm like, oh, yeah, this is really cool.

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:21.220
I kind of know where everything is and I know what to expect.

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:29.400
And I can then create that feedback loop where there are maybe snippets of code that I want to include in future ones.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:34.300
So you can just kind of keep populating that cookie cutter with the most recent code.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:34.520
That's right.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:39.820
You take your learnings from the last one and you kind of make the project a little bit better, a little bit better, a little bit better.

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.620
Exactly.

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:50.640
You know, and the other thing we talked a lot about Excel, one of the things that I think is I've, you know, started to learn more about data science and use some of these tools.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:53:04.040
And there is a different approach to looking at data when you look at it almost from this data science approach versus looking at it from Excel and the data science approach of you do exploratory data analysis on the data set.

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:09.400
And you start to learn things that are easy to do with the pandas data frame that are maybe hard to do with Excel.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.560
So just simple things about like, where are my null values?

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.340
Where do I have duplicates?

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:18.940
Where, you know, where is maybe the data not as clean as I would expect?

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:32.060
You can kind of go through that as part of that process that I think is maybe a little more robust, a little more natural for data analysis than just trying to open up an Excel file and do a bunch of auto filters and pivot tables.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:35.160
Yeah, and it doesn't matter how big the data is or how wide it is.

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:39.500
Whereas in Excel, it's like, you kind of got to live visually in the data.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:40.400
You know what I mean?

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:45.240
You're like, you got to have your charts and stuff swim there rather than it's fine.

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.260
It has 200 columns.

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.300
You know, we load it and it's just like you show it below where the data went, right?

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:49.660
It's all good.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:50.480
Yeah, exactly.

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.900
And I think it also starts to, you start to learn the data science concept.

00:53:54.900 --> 00:54:01.840
So the concept of tidy data, you know, is certainly something I never really understood just as an Excel user.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.920
Yeah, define that for us.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.260
So essentially, I knew you were going to ask me that.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.340
Now, I should have looked up a better definition.

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:17.140
But instead of when you have a row of data, it's like a single observation in that row versus having multiple columns of data.

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:31.620
So think about like if you're observing cars passing on the street, you would have a car and then maybe you'd have the make and the model versus multiple columns with all the different makes and models and yes, no's in each column.

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:42.160
And the reason it's important is a lot of these data science tools then make it very easy to manipulate and more importantly, visualize the data when it's in tidy format.

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:52.280
And once you get it in that format, then suddenly the opportunities for visualization that are available to you are really powerful that you just can't do in Excel very well.

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.200
Yeah, that's cool.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.600
I see a lot of interesting things sort of coming from this, right?

00:54:56.600 --> 00:55:02.740
Somebody moves a little bit out of Excel, they kind of get in with Jupyter, they kind of learn Pandas.

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:11.220
And all of a sudden, they start thinking, you know what, how hard would it be to train a machine learning model to predict rather than just a report, right?

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:11.520
Exactly.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.220
There's just a few little steps.

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:13.760
Yeah.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:22.360
Those things are not that hard, but you need tidy data and you need like good, got to get the right factors or aspects of your data you want to feed to the model and all that kind of stuff, right?

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:22.880
Absolutely.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:29.260
And you know, one of the things that I put in the notes for us to talk about was Facebook's profit tool.

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:30.240
Yeah, tell us about that.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:38.140
I think this is a really interesting example of a really powerful tool that lots of analysts need.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:43.500
And if you just learn a little bit of Python, you can do some really cool things.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:50.300
So the project for those not familiar with this, it's an open source project that Facebook put out, I don't know, a couple years ago.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:55.680
And it's a tool for making predictions about time series data.

00:55:56.020 --> 00:56:02.260
So think about if you wanted to predict, like how many hits are you going to have on your website in the future?

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:09.700
Or, you know, their example is about hits on Wikipedia hits on Peyton Manning is the thing that they walk through.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:14.580
But I think any organization is going to have a lot of, can you predict the future?

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.580
Can you predict what we need to manufacture?

00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.920
Can you predict what our sales are going to be like?

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.440
Can you predict what this marketing campaign is going to do?

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:21.660
Yeah.

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.860
Imagine you were the person who had that answer.

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:25.480
Right?

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.580
You would just be like, you're the magician.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.280
Exactly.

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:38.360
And what I think, what I suspect happens is, you know, most big organizations, maybe in supply chain, you do have someone that is really smart on this type of prediction.

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:42.040
But you have to predict all across the organization.

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.380
And so what do most people do?

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:49.160
You know, you plot out your history and maybe you kind of do some sort of regression line and kind of make a guess.

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:57.080
But if you start to look at all the different mathematical options you have for predicting time series data, it's mind boggling, right?

00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.200
Like, how could you figure all that out?

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.740
So Facebook essentially had this problem.

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:19.560
So they built this library where they put some fairly sophisticated math behind it, but a very simple API where you can only change a few variables and get some really nice predictions and some really nice visibility to the trends in your data.

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:33.060
So I've been really impressed with it and think it's a really cool tool because it strikes a really nice balance of power, but easy to use for someone that's not a, you know, PhD math professor.

00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:33.720
Yeah, that's cool.

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.920
And it seems like it's a good fit for the people we're talking about in the show.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:37.640
Yeah, absolutely.

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.280
Yeah.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:38.800
Nice.

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:39.420
All right.

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:42.960
We're getting a little short on time, but I do want to ask you a few more things real quick before we go.

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.240
Let's close this out.

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.460
Like we talked about all the benefits.

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:55.720
We talked about all the good things here, but maybe let's just talk on a few areas on what Python needs to do better to better take advantage of this group and just go farther.

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.180
Sure.

00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.540
So a couple of things.

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:01.260
So we did have a good discussion about should we use Miniconda?

00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:03.420
Should we use Python from the Windows Store?

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:11.920
You know, I think that is still a good area for us to figure out, you know, what is the preferred way to get Python out and then install it on a system?

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.520
And then more importantly, how do you keep it updated?

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:27.980
There's still some kind of wonkiness between installing with Conda and Pip, and I've been bitten by it before where suddenly I'm installing with pip and it's unwinding some of my Condas install.

00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:32.820
And that is something that a new user is not going to figure out.

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:33.460
That's not going to be okay.

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:33.940
Yeah.

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:34.260
No.

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:38.000
So I think that's something that needs to be solved.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.320
And I know folks are working on that.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:55.040
I think the other one is this whole, like we talked a little bit about data visualization and it could probably be expanded more broadly is like once you start getting into Python, there are some areas where it's hard to make a decision about which direction I should go.

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.980
So data viz is a great example.

00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:58.300
Like I want to plot something.

00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.560
What do I do?

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.640
Do I do a matplotlib?

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.720
Do I do bokeh?

00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.040
Do I do seaborne?

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.320
You know, all the various options.

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:12.480
You come from having one choice, the little charts, insert chart drop down to the paradox of choice of open source, right?

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.200
Exactly.

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:14.000
Exactly.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.720
And then I think the other one, and I know you've talked about it a little bit, is the whole distribution problem.

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:29.180
So how do you get these Python scripts, programs, notebooks, whatever they are out there so that other people can use?

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:33.280
And do you have to go through some sort of EXE conversion?

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.380
Do you have to have some other way to distribute the files?

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:45.280
You know, in my mind, Envision, wouldn't it be cool that you had kind of a little launcher type thing that would go and check and download the most recent files and put a little GUI around it?

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:48.080
But something like that needs to be in place.

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:52.200
Otherwise, you're going to have a whole different type of maintenance nightmare.

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:52.660
Yeah.

00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:59.540
I mean, we talked about GUI and PyInstaller, but these are sort of not super perfect projects.

00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.140
They're great.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:04.320
They're really awesome that they exist, but they're not a general solution.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:04.900
Right.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:05.560
Right.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:10.520
And that's the reason Excel works so well, is I can put an Excel file together.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:18.260
And once I give you that Excel file, for the most part, it's going to work because it's got all that Microsoft Office guts behind it.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.000
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:19.620
All right.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:20.560
One other thing.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:32.140
Are you familiar with the Microsoft user voice where they ask for features and they have one on Excel, one where somebody suggested that Python replace VBA as the Excel scripting language or maybe in addition to?

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:32.800
Have you seen this?

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.620
I've seen that.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.000
Yes.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.380
Yeah.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:35.440
And there's a lot of excitement.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:35.880
Yeah.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.060
It blew up.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:42.640
I mean, there's like 5,800 votes and just people going, wow, please, please, please make it happen.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.220
You know what I mean?

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.360
And I'm probably like most people.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.500
When I first saw it, I thought, wow, this is awesome.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.300
Wouldn't that be perfect?

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:55.680
But the more I thought about it, I don't know if that's really a good thing or not, because it probably depends on the implementation.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.660
And I'm not smart enough to understand how they would do it.

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:03.160
But like, I think like we talked about the power of Python is the ecosystem.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:11.400
And so that I can use conda or pip to install something like, am I going to have all that available to me in Excel or would it just be?

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.480
Yeah, that's really interesting.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:19.300
I mean, you can, I think you can embed like DLLs into Excel through like .NET.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.580
And then there's Python and SQL Server.

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.540
There may be a way.

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:30.340
But, you know, as you say that, I also kind of think some of the advantages we spoke about, version control, like not a whole bunch of go-tos, but straightforward code.

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.560
You know, like all those things would still be absent, right?

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.520
So I'm kind of on the fence as well.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:41.100
I mean, I'd sure rather see Python than VBA, but maybe VBA is needed there to chase them out of that area into a better place.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.460
Yeah, I think so.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:43.680
But we'll wait and see.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.640
I don't know if it's, they're making progress with it or not.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.280
Yeah, I don't know.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.600
My feeling is there's not a lot of action.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.540
There's kind of like, wow, people really want this more than we thought.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.100
I don't know if we want to do this, but that's just my looking from the outside.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.060
I agree.

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:57.740
I agree.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:58.000
Cool.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.280
All right.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.240
Well, Chris, it's been great to talk about.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.120
Before you get out of here, let me hit you with the final two questions.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.700
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:09.280
Mostly I'm Sublime or Jupyter Notebook.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:09.620
Okay.

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:10.780
Yeah, that's a good fit.

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:12.920
And then notable PyPI package.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.500
Yeah.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.380
We talk quite a bit about Pandas.

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.720
You know, I'm a huge, huge Pandas fan.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.520
I assume most of your listeners are familiar with that.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.800
But I'll put a plug in from a data viz perspective.

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:27.480
So I've been using Altair quite a bit recently.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.580
And I know you've talked about it a little bit.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.520
And I'm really starting to like that package.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.460
It seems to fit well with the types of business analysis that I'm involved with.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:41.760
Still enjoy Seaborn for some of the more complicated statistical analysis.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.480
Altair is pretty cool.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:50.400
And I'm hopeful that it will continue to develop and, you know, get more and more powerful and

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:50.880
more used.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.440
Yeah, for sure.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.220
It looks really cool.

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.300
And there's some nice stuff.

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.600
And also shout out to Altair recipes.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.520
So like quick little things you can use.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.960
That's a nice project to even make it simpler, right?

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.700
Yes, absolutely.

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:01.200
All right.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.180
Well, final call to action.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:07.480
People surely work in their company with folks who have this Excel hell problem.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.500
What do you tell them?

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:13.760
Yeah, you know, reach out to if you know Python and you're in a big organization, there's probably

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.240
people out there that could really benefit from your knowledge.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:21.140
And you don't necessarily need to quit your day job, but reach out to those folks, spread

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:26.260
the word a little bit about Python and be good resource for them to get up to speed and

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.840
understand what Python can do for them.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.440
Yeah, awesome.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:28.880
I agree.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:33.260
I think you can make a huge difference by writing software, but sort of empowering these

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:35.940
folks to go explore what they got to do.

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:36.380
Yeah.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.060
And be patient as they learn.

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.120
Yeah, absolutely.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:40.800
Be patient.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.040
It's going to take some, but I'm sure it's worth it.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:43.320
