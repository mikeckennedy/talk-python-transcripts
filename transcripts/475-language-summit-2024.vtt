Every year the core developers meet to discuss and propose the major changes and trends in Python itself.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.780
This invite-only conference of about 50 people happens inside PyCon in the US. Because it's private,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.300
we rarely get detailed looks inside this event. On this episode,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.140
we have Seth Michael Larson here to give us his account of the sessions and proposals.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.940
It's a unique look into the zeitgeist of CPython. This is Talk Python to Me, episode

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.240
275, recorded August 22nd, 2024.

Hey, Seth. Welcome back to Talk Python To Me.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.520
>>Hey, Michael.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.440
>>Awesome to have you here. I'm really excited to get a look into the zeitgeist of the core

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.680
devs and the people building Python for us through the Python Language Summit.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.760
>>Yeah, let's do it.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.280
So we're going to talk about the 2024 Language Summit that happened in Pittsburgh.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.600
It's like an embedded mini conference inside of PyCon, which is smart rather than trying to travel

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.600
all over. But before we get into that and all those things, I know you've been on the show not

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.600
too long ago, but for those who may have missed your introductions, who are you?

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.080
What do you do for Python these days?

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.600
>>I'm Seth Larsen, and I've been working at the Python Software Foundation for a little over a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.840
year now as the security developer in residence. And so that means that I do a lot of stuff

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.440
related to security just for the entire Python ecosystem. That's CPython, pip, packaging

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.520
ecosystem, like outwardly facing things for PyPI, maybe not as much the internals. I leave that for

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.560
Mike Fiedler, the PyPI safety and security engineer. And I maintain a lot of open source

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.560
projects specifically in like the HTTP and internet space. So like requests, urllib3,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.000
TrustStore, things like that.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.120
>>Oh, awesome. Yeah. Thanks for everything you're doing there. And how's the role working out? I

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.520
know this is one of, you were the first person in this role, like officially, right? Is that true?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.640
>>That is true. Yeah. I was the first security oriented hire at the PSF. It's been going really

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.120
great. I mean, I feel like we've made a lot of improvements and there's a lot of exciting stuff

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.800
that I'm working on today. And I don't know, I think one of the things that also got highlighted

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.840
because this role exists, it just means that more people at the PSF and in CPython core team and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.000
just in the Python ecosystem in general are talking more about security. And like, that's just as

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.160
important as the stuff that I'm doing day to day is that it's just, there's just more awareness of

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.280
what's happening in security.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:57.520
>>Yeah. So I have two polar opposite thoughts here. One is I'm really surprised how few

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.600
significant issues there are in Python, CPython, you know, the interpreter, the runtime, the

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.640
standard library, all that. It's really rare that you get a, you know, red light splashing. Oh my

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.200
gosh, go patch your systems now. There's sometimes really minor things like this audit trail is not

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.800
completely followed under this condition, but that's not a, the pager goes off and you know,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.680
cause you got, it's now a race. That's one thing. So that's awesome. Right. That the other is

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.240
PyPI, typo squatting, all the, all the stuff that makes Python extra good, the half million

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.520
packages and other shady things people do. And we're going to talk about this in the broader

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.680
sense, not PyPI, but you know, in the open source space of like, well, what if, what if somebody

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.360
took over a GitHub account for a little while or, or something? Yeah. So, and that's not on fire,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.120
but that's, there are battles being waged actively there, I would say. Right. So it's a

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.000
contrast, right?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.840
>>There, I can speak with confidence that there is malware on PyPI right now as we speak, but

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.880
like, yeah, so that's, that's the case. Right. I think it really has to do with CPython is an

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:17.120
incredibly mature project in like every sense of the word, like governance, security, design, all

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.280
of these things. Right. And like, there's just a huge amount of people and resources being, being

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.840
work, like working on CPython at any one moment and like contrast that to the, you said half a

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:35.160
million, you know, I tend to focus on the like 95% of downloads by totality. Right. Because

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.320
there, there's a lot of projects on PyPI that maybe don't have the supply chain criticality of

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.040
others. Right. But yeah, absolutely. A hundred percent. And when you, I think when you hone in

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.880
on that smaller window of projects it ends up being a much better picture than

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.240
>>I think it's, I think it's a hundred percent good picture. Honestly, there are legitimate bugs

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.480
that people have to deal with. Like, you know, maybe there's a Django release that says we

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.160
didn't validate the CRF token in, in this particular form. So you should update your Django.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.600
Right. And that's, that's just a legit bug. That's not people attempting to do bad things.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.600
>>I mean, I can't even take really any credit for how secure and mature CPython is. I'm such a

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:23.840
late addition in the life of CPython and like PyPI projects. So it really is the community. I

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.920
think it is just, there's so much investment and so much love and care happening in all these

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.480
projects that it does speak volumes. But that, I mean, that doesn't mean that we need to think

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.720
that things need to be perfect or that it's necessarily a bad thing to have a vulnerability

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.400
in a, in a project because there's projects that are even more mature than CPython that have

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.360
vulnerabilities all the time. It's totally normal. I think the important thing is just like knowing

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.800
what to do when that happens. And that's where I come in.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.360
>>Yeah. I don't want to belabor this because you know, the security angle, while interesting to me

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.360
and central to what you're up to is not the topic, but I do think it's interesting that the White

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.280
House recently came out. I think it was the White House. It said, we recommend Python and a couple

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.360
other languages. We basically, we, we recommend memory safe languages, which did you see that

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.400
post? You must have, right?

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.920
>>I certainly did. And I actually had a, a big part of recommending that to the White House. So

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.520
when the...

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.080
>>No kidding. I had no idea.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.800
>>Yeah. Yeah. So the, the PSF, we responded to the request for information that CISA put out or the

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.960
office of the cyber director put out, I think a year and change ago. And in that post, we recommended

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.920
CPython and Python in general as a memory safe language and went into all the details about like,

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.600
yes, it's written in C, but like the language itself, what people will actually be programming

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:51.560
in is Python. And we also emphasized how Python is a bridge into memory unsafe languages. And because

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.960
of all the focus on performance lately, it's actually like sometimes in some cases more

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.080
performant to keep the code written in Python as opposed to writing it in C. And so we emphasize a

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.960
whole bunch of stuff. And so I think that that had a small percentage of the reason why that was

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.600
recommended as...

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.960
>>Put it on the radar and positioned it correctly, maybe.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.640
>>Exactly.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.760
>>Awesome. Well, congratulations. I was just going to say that's kind of interesting, but there's

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.680
way more to it than that.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.320
>>There's a lot happening behind the scenes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.440
>>Yeah, there is. All right. Shall we talk about this language summit thing?

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.240
>>Let's do it.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:31.800
>>Let's do it. So let's just, I mean, I gave it sort of a vague intro. You wrote a nice blog post

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:38.640
about it here on the Python blog. Just give us a sense of what the language summit, what is it for?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.240
Is this something, is it like an open space I can go to or not?

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:52.640
>>No, so it is a specific space for Python core developers to use. And so I think the whole goal

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:59.640
of this is to get a bunch of core developers in a room together to discuss things and to kind of get

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:07.120
some recommendations, some ideas flowing maybe without necessarily like having the full formed

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.280
thought, right? Because like putting something out there, like completely radically changing the

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.280
direction of Python, that's a lot to put that out just publicly, whatever. And so this is like a

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.800
place to collaborate for core developers and some special guests, because not everyone that's there

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.760
is a core developer, but it is invite. So you have to like apply to go and say why you want to go.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.080
>>Yeah. I think just folks who were, I can't remember if it was Sebastian Ramirez or Samuel

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.480
Cullinan or something around the typing thing. I remember some of those folks might've been at one

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.960
of them because they're like, wait, we can't change typing to be more performant where it

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.360
completely ignores the runtime stuff. Cause we have all these frameworks.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.400
>>Right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah. But the language summit, it's a whole bunch of different

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.800
like submitted topics. People will talk and then there's discussion and some outcome. Maybe

00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:01.840
there's no outcome. Maybe there's like next steps. Maybe we solve some problems within the time of

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.760
the meeting. And yeah, my job there was to actually like take down all the notes and write about it

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.680
and like publish these blog posts. Cause one of the reasons why this is allowed to be like an

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:17.360
invite only meeting is that there is someone who is basically taking notes and blogging about

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.760
everything that gets discussed and like what happened during the discussion so that the

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.680
community can learn about what actually happened without necessarily, you know, getting the

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.800
rawness of it, I guess.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.680
>>Yeah. There's a real careful balance you got to strike between allowing the freedom to say

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.000
whatever without public scrutiny, but at the same time, you don't want it to be like, well, the

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.480
Python cabal met. They've decided.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.000
>>Exactly.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.760
>>They don't like, they don't like your idea or whatever.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.560
>>Exactly.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:51.400
>>Yeah. It's cool. So I'll point people, obviously it's going to be in the show notes. When people

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.760
at your write up, it's like a meta post, I guess. Would you say that? It's, it talks about, you

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.480
know, sort of

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.360
>>Landing page.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:06.840
>>Landing page. Exactly. 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. And then 9 topics and presentations that

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.880
were covered. And then the lightning talks, which is also almost like another sub meta section. So

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.440
there's a, there's a lot to explore here and there's nice write-ups on each of these. So where

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.240
should we start? And we want to kind of wrap up the conversation we were just having, because that

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.000
was actually a little bit of a topic at the language summit, right?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.640
>>Yeah. Security was definitely a topic at the language summit. This, this was somewhat in the,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:38.280
in the recent light, like the light of XZ when XZ had happened. Pablo, one of the release managers

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:46.040
for CPython 310 and 311, I believe brought this topic and it was basically discussing Python's

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:53.240
like contribution and release and all of that model in the light of XZ. So like XZ, I'll just

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.040
go over really quickly.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.960
>>Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure people about XZ.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.240
>>Yeah. I'm sure a lot of people have like heard of it at this point, but.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.320
>>It was such a long game deal. It was crazy. So yeah. What is,

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.960
>>That's the scary part.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.200
>>What is XZutils and then what is the XZutils security issue?

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:18.520
>>Yeah. So XZutils is a library written in C for basically processing archives of the XZ

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:25.160
format, which is just a compression format like, like GZIP, like, you know, any other

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:32.040
compression format, Zotfli, Brotli, all of those. And so this library was maintained by a single

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:39.720
person, big surprise. And what is relatively little known, right before all of this happened,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.080
I would say, it was probably just adding features, fixing bugs every once in a while, make a release

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:53.560
and all of that. And what ended up happening is this project was identified as a project that had

00:12:53.560 --> 00:13:02.040
very few maintainers and also through a series of reasons had a linkage to SSH. And so what

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.840
ended up happening. Yep. And so SSH was

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.160
>>If you can get into SSH and SSHD, then bad things are going to happen.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:15.800
>>Yeah. So the whole end goal of this entire operation was to get access to open SSH

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:23.240
through like linking basically. And so what ended up happening is a bunch of fake sock puppet

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.680
accounts showed up after this loan maintainer indicated that they were having a little bit

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.720
of trouble maintaining the project and like meeting user demands. Like these sock puppet

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:40.200
accounts show up like days before they were actually used and all kind of in similar fashion.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:46.520
And basically are pressuring this maintainer to either make them feel like they're not doing a

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:53.480
good job or to try to add a new maintainer. In this case, Giotan is the pseudonym that this

00:13:53.480 --> 00:14:02.520
account used. And what ended up happening is over a year of like legitimate positive contribution

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.960
from this account, this account was added as a like equivalent to a release manager, right?

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:13.560
Like someone who is approving PRs and merging things and is capable of accessing the actual

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:20.280
archives when releases happen. And then a good chunk of time passes after that. And there's a

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:27.240
couple of little changes added that on their own are not an attack, but it was preparing for

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:34.760
an attack where essentially a small change was added into the release archives that was not a

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:41.480
part of the source tree that activated the entire attack chain. And then when this started to like

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:47.560
be pulled in downstream into things like, you know, Fedora, early versions of Red Hat, this

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.280
never went into any stable builds, but it was all the pre-releases. This ended up getting onto

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.400
people's machines and then was eventually discovered because of a very small performance

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:03.240
difference when logging into SSH. - Yeah, and that was somebody who wasn't even looking,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.400
forgot the person's name, but they worked at Microsoft and they were just, I think on the

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.720
Azure team or something. And they just were like, why did this slow down a little bit? That's weird.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:17.160
And they're like, wait a minute, what is this doing in here? Yeah, it was on the verge. And,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.200
you know, what a long game. One person, one account came along and was just, you know,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.120
I'm going to hear to help you. I'm just going to make, I'm going to try to just become your

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:32.040
best friend contributor. And then another one is just abusing, like mentally abusing the people.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.720
Like, why don't you just quit? Why don't you get some more support? And then like, who, well,

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.040
let me reach out to some people who are helping me out recently. And it turns out these are like

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.400
two sides of the same coin. - Yep, exactly. - Yeah, shady. Okay. Luckily that got caught.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.560
Cause you know, there's a lot of servers in the world that can be SSHed into and like, well,

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.200
we got, you know, public private key encryption. You can't break through that stuff long as you

00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:01.000
don't use passwords, like you're going to be fine unless you're not. - I received a lovely email

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.200
on the day that this happened, report to the security response team for Python, because we,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:13.400
of course, use the XC utils libraries because Python supports XC format as well. And I,

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.920
there was a, there was a lovely few seconds where I'm like, oh, this is either going to be

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:22.440
a fine day for me or a really bad day. And it ended up being a fine day. So. - That's good.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.800
It's like, are we going to be canceling all our plans for next few weeks? - Yeah. Yep. Am I going

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:33.640
to have lots of questions to answer from like concerned customers, users, but it was fine.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.840
- Yeah. Yeah. I find this kind of stuff is a lot like everything's fine. You're relaxed. Just

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.160
work's going good. Life's going good. And then, you know, something's on fire, just out of the

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.320
blue and you have this, you know, it takes your breath away moment. Like, oh, does that apply to

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:53.800
us as well? Because if it does, everything just changed. - Fun times. - Yeah. Really glad I did.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:17:01.320
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Posit, the makers of Shiny, formerly RStudio,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:07.080
and especially Shiny for Python. Let me ask you a question. Are you building awesome things?

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:11.080
Of course you are. You're a developer or data scientist. That's what we do. And you should

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:16.840
check out Posit Connect. Posit Connect is a way for you to publish, share, and deploy all the

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:22.680
data products that you're building using Python. People ask me the same question all the time.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.240
Michael, I have some cool data science project or notebook that I built. How do I share it with my

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:34.680
users, stakeholders, teammates? Do I need to learn FastAPI or Flask or maybe Vue or React.js? Hold

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.160
on now. Those are cool technologies, and I'm sure you'd benefit from them, but maybe stay focused on

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.360
the data project. Let Posit Connect handle that side of things. With Posit Connect, you can rapidly

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:51.080

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:21.000
podcast player show notes. Thank you to the team at Posit for supporting Talk Python.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.920
One of the talks was Python security model after this issue, the XCUtils backdoor. Tell us about

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:35.320
that. Yeah. So this entire talk was essentially just overviewing like, "Hey, is this possible?

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:41.000
Is this possible for CPython to be impacted by such an attack?" And I mean, the answer is yes,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.480
it really is. Because if you have accounts that are willing to put years of effort into

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:53.480
contributing good code to CPython, right? That is enough to become a core developer likely.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.800
And if you're a core developer, it means you can merge PRs. It means if you get two core

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.600
developer accounts promoted to this level of authorization, you can merge your own PRs with

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:12.440
review, right? The big focus on this talk was like, "Okay, how can we prevent this? And in the

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.160
ways that we can't prevent it, how can we be ready?" And kind of like discussing whether or not

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.360
we're ready at this point. And I think the big consensus was that if we were to discover

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.480
something like this that had already been merged into Python or had been released in Python, that

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:34.200
we would be okay to be able to get the word out. That sort of infrastructure already exists,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.840
and we're not too worried about that. We're a CNA. We can create a CVE really quickly.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.800
We can get the announcements out really quickly. We can get releases out really quickly. So in that

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:50.120
way, the reactive sense, we're okay. In the proactive sense, which is the more important

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:55.240
one, but it's also the harder one. - Yeah, because when nation states

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.400
hire people to say the next three years of your job, it's almost like-

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.240
- And it's like a team. - Like a spy, yeah.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.400
- A team of people for multiple years. - Yes, exactly. It's like the CIA or MI6

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.720
or something, on the code side. - To be honest with you, it doesn't even

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:15.720
need to necessarily be nation state level stuff for this to happen because vulnerabilities in

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:23.080
popular pieces of software are very lucrative. You can sell them and people make a lot of money

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.240
on selling vulnerabilities to projects. So why not grow your own, right?

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.880
- Exactly. - Yeah, go ahead.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.240
- One of the things I think is great is there's a really long release cycle,

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:43.160
and a staged rollout. So I don't know how many people jump in and install alpha one of some

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.800
Python, but it's pretty limited and it's not gonna make it. No, no, of course, I know,

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:55.400
I see you raising your hand. However, I don't see that shipping on Ubuntu's update channel or

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.840
Docker's a whole different deal. Let's not even go there. But on the main Docker images.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:06.920
- Yeah, yeah. I mean, the slow rollout is definitely a big part of it, right? A lot of

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:13.720
people get their Python, not direct from the source, they get it from a distribution or they

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:20.680
get it from, if they, like Amazon Linux with Python or whatever, right? Like it's a distribution of

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.680
Python. - Or brew install or-

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:29.400
- Brew install Python, yeah. So a lot of people are not living on the edge. And I think that that

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.440
helps in a way. Obviously, people that are living on the edge, maybe they're the more valuable

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:42.200
targets, but I mean, I'm not gonna be the one to encourage that. Yeah, I don't think that,

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.320
I think the biggest defenses against this, and this was what was discussed there, was

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:53.000
trying to push things to be in the open. And actually, in a way, open source is uniquely

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.400
able to respond and- - Right, right, right, right.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:00.520
- Defend it against for these sorts of attacks. Because if this were to happen in Windows,

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:07.880
for example, would we have had the almost immediate, being able to debug what the actual

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:14.440
attack was, how long this had been going on, what patches were bad, right? That sort of visibility

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.840
into the source code is something that was really important in being able to actually track this

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:25.960
thing down. And so having test files and binary files not checked into source code and instead

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.840
generated. So one of the parts of this attack that allowed it to go hidden for so long and be

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:37.000
checked into source code was that almost all of the attack code was hidden extremely well in a

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.840
binary file, which made it so that code reviewers- - Some of the test binary elements,

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.960
'cause if you've got a compression file utility, you've gotta have compressed files for your unit

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.000
test, right? - Exactly. So it was, basically,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.200
these files were checked in and there's just huge binary blobs that you can't actually get your

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.920
eyeballs on to review. We talk about lots of eyeballs make for shallow bugs. Well, if the

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:06.920
eyeballs can't see the bugs, then you're not gonna find them. And so we talked about removing binary

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.400
files from the source code or making sure that all the binary files that are generated have a

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:17.480
script that allows them to be generated anytime and things like that. - Is it one of the changes,

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:23.160
I recently, I can't remember if this was on IPI or if this is a GitHub thing, but allowing GitHub

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:30.120
to be the thing that publishes directly, builds the wheels and uploads them to PyPI rather than

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.240
somebody downloading the code, building them and uploading it, which obviously that's a opaque

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:43.000
step there. - Yeah. So other things that tie more strongly these, whatever release artifacts are

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.880
actually ending up on people's machines to the source code. So that's, I mean, I would call that

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.920
build provenance. There's a whole bunch of different frameworks that that works under,

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:57.400
but yeah, build provenance, being able to tie in an artifact that's installed in your system back

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:04.200
to the actual source code so that when you are evaluating that artifact on whether you want to

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:09.240
install that on your system or deciding whether to upgrade or whatever, you can look at the source

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.960
code instead of looking at this compiled binary. That's something that I really want to focus on

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:19.560
for PyPI in the future, but yeah, we're not there yet. - Awesome. Yeah. 'Cause when you look at a

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.800
project, you say, well, let me see what the release is on GitHub. If you know that literally

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.960
that was the thing that compiled or got built and then that's what's on PyPI, that's a different

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:36.680
forensic analysis than somebody's machine. - What it ends up nice, like being nice is that it,

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.480
and this is the tough part is that I feel like a lot of people's behavior, which is to go on

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.440
GitHub and look at the diff between like tags. That's what a lot of people do, but that's not

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.440
actually what you should do. You should be looking at the diff between the artifacts. That's the

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.520
thing that's actually installed in your machine, but that's way harder to do than looking at the

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.560
tags. So adding build- - We just crowdsource it. We're all

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.640
crowdsourcing it. Like wait for somebody to scream. - In a way we are.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.840
- I know we are. - In a way we are.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:10.040
Just related to this while we're still on this topic, you talked about the, somewhere, there we

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:17.320
go. There's also big news around CVEs, which are official vulnerability numbering. So they're

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:26.120
referenced through all those cybersecurity talk and stuff. You can describe it better. So big

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:32.840
news is that the PSF now, and you alluded to this, is now an official numbering authority. So rather

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.960
than saying there's a problem with Python, who's going to sort of officially call this out and

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.000
write it up and so on, you guys can do that directly now, right?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.120
- Yeah. So CVEs are basically, it's a set of identifiers and records that show, it's like a

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:53.400
bunch of metadata about vulnerabilities in software is what it is. And it's only one system.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:58.920
There are a bunch of other vulnerability databases, but CVE seems to be the one that everyone uses or

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:05.800
references. And so what being a CVE numbering authority gives us is it makes it so that

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:14.040
someone at the PSF can operate the CVE UI and workflow and all of that to say like, "Oh,

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:19.640
we want to create a new CVE ID on behalf of the Python team or on behalf of the pip team."

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:25.720
And what that ends up meaning is that because we are part of the process, instead of having to go

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:31.960
to some other entity, so like Mitre or Red Hat or Microsoft, there's a whole bunch of CNAs. There's

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:39.720
over a hundred now, I think. Instead of going to someone else that isn't as well-versed in Python

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:46.760
or our release schedule or any of those things, we get to inject the knowledge that we have about

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:52.040
Python into all of these records, into all these advisories. And it makes it so that we don't

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.120
actually have to talk to someone else to be able to handle a vulnerability end to end.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:02.600
Before, you would potentially have a reporter going to talk to someone else and getting a CVE

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:08.440
ID, and then they would come talk to us. And by that point, it's hard to make a determination,

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.840
and there's a whole bunch of things that have already happened, and maybe there's

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.960
messes that need to get cleaned up to make sure that it's not confusing.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:19.800
So by owning the entire process, we're able to make sure that things are as little confusing

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.960
as possible, like what actually needs to be done for users when we publish these things.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.240
Yeah, that's great. I want to move off the security angle here, because I know there's

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:35.240
so much more to talk about. However, you guys, have you considered or ever run any sort of bug

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.960
bounty program? We don't have a bug bounty program right now. I mean, the hard part with

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:45.160
a bug bounty program is it takes money. So if you would like to see a bug bounty program happening

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:49.640
at the PSF, get in touch with the PSF. Send an email.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.640
Yeah, I think incentives are really aligned there. There's a lot of companies that

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.960
have this tooling at the center of their data center. So maybe.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.000
Yeah, maybe.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.240
Maybe, maybe we can make it happen. All right, next up, the REPL,

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.680
or the PyREPL for the Python PyREPL. What's the deal with this?

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:12.440
Yeah, so this was a talk that was given by a couple of different core devs. I think this

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:18.920
included a bunch of people, Pablo, Lukasz, and Lissandros all gave this talk. And it was about,

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:26.120
hey, this new REPL that's coming in Python 3.13. Here's all the cool stuff that it can do, and

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:31.080
how it makes the usability so much better for people. And they demoed a whole bunch of the

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:36.360
new features, which was really exciting. There was lots of applause showing off a few of these, like

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:43.800
little features. And I think that the other side of it is because this new REPL is written in

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:50.200
Python and not written in C, it lowers the barrier for contributions and maintenance drastically.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:57.240
Before the REPL was super entwined with the parser and all of these other really low level

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.560
details of Python that a lot of people probably didn't want to get involved with if they didn't

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:08.280
have to, versus this where it's this completely separate and much more easy to contribute to

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:15.800
piece of software. Yeah. And did this come from the PyPy project? Yes, this was PyPy. And I think

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.680
that there's been some back and forth, contributing back, contributing forward, all of that, which is

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.000
also really great, right? Having one REPL shared between two different implementations. Yeah,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.800
that's great. Just working better together, more people working on it. I always call it

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:36.120
PYPY because some people call Python packaging injects, PyPy, but that's also this other thing.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:42.360
Anyway. It's a non-zero part of every one of my days, right? I'm sure that is. Because a lot of

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:47.960
the times, a significant percentage of my work as a security person is being in working groups that

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.800
are not Python related at all. And yeah, there's a lot of PyPys flying around. Yeah. You talk about

00:29:53.800 --> 00:30:00.360
NumPy being on PyPy and you're like, okay, hold on. Hold on. Could be two different things.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:06.040
There's a lot going on here. Yeah. So this is really interesting. I haven't really played

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.320
with it much. I honestly don't spend a ton of time in the bare Python REPL. Like if I'm

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:18.440
REPLing, a lot of times I'm in the JetBrains sort of enhanced REPL that's inside PyCharm,

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:23.800
something like that. But, and I think partly because there was a lot of challenges with

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.200
the bare Python REPL, right? There's no autocomplete, but worse than that was

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:33.080
if you've got a five line function and you want to edit it, you've kind of got to go to the top

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:38.920
part, hit her, like it's, it really was hard to work with blocks of code. There's no color,

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.640
things like that. Yeah. Color is the standard for, you don't have color in your terminal at

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:49.240
this point. Like even 2020. You've basically given up at that point. If you don't have an emoji and

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:54.360
you don't have color, I mean. Emojis, color, got to have like the rainbow prompt, maybe like the

00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:00.680
logo of the thing when it starts up. A starship. I didn't even consider the ASCII art and possibly

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.440
the ASCII art in color. No, seriously though, I do think it sounds like a minor deal, but just

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:11.960
the readability of having highlighting and stuff. Yeah. Syntax highlighting is huge. Syntax

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.880
highlighting is like really huge. That's not a part of the current REPL, I don't think, but like

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:23.320
it becomes much more possible because this PyREPL exists. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think that like

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.880
the biggest thing, yeah, like the whole blocks of code, I just remember the demo of them showing

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:32.360
like, oh, you have like five lines. You have to hit up, up, up like four times. It's just like,

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.440
oh, if you mess it up, you got to start over. You got to start over and you're just, you're

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:41.000
just sad. You just contemplate putting it in a file instead of doing this in the REPL. Exactly.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.320
That's why I'm not in there. I avoid being in there because it's hard. This will be really,

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:49.480
really great for people that are just starting Python journey. Cause I think that a lot of people

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:55.160
learning and starting off will use the REPL straight up instead of an IDE. And so like

00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:00.600
having this, there was a big focus on like teachability and documenting it and making it

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.400
work the same. Like if you actually like read the post, like what the discussions were about for

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:09.320
like everyone is basically totally in favor. They loved it, but they wanted to make sure that this

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:14.760
was going to be like a consistent experience, specifically like Carol willing had this big

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:19.320
point about like having a consistent experience being really important for teaching Python

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.320
across different operating systems. So, yeah. And something a little bit,

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.480
a little bit better than up, up, up five times and don't get it out of order. Exactly. Yeah.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:33.000
That's cool. Though, I guess one of the, I don't know if this was discussed, but one of the

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.880
challenges of this, I think is it requires, and it's not necessarily bad, but just a challenge

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:44.600
is I think it requires the new windows terminal rather than say cmd.exe, the older style. So it

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.680
just works out of the box on macOS and on Linux, but on windows, you got to be a little careful

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.520
about how you run it. Is that right? So I actually don't know what the current status of all of this

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:58.360
is because the time has marched on since these blog posts have happened. And there has been a lot

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:03.480
of work done on the windows side, the current team, like the team that presented this didn't

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:09.160
have any windows experience. And so they didn't know really how hard it was going to be. I think

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:14.200
that there's been a lot of strides in the windows side of things. So I think the situation's better.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:19.880
I don't know offhand if cmd.exe is supported or if it's just the new windows terminal, but I,

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.880
I think it's fine. I was sitting in windows terminal. Like people need to be using that

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:29.400
thing anyway. It's true. It's like opening up on your Mac and just having like the bare white bash,

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:35.320
I guess it's Z shell these days, but just the completely, you know, non-fixed font.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.920
Like, what is this thing that you are running? Like, you're like, the terminal is horrible.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.000
Like, well, that thing is, but you know, you could make it a lot nicer by the way. And,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.760
you know, it's, it's similar, trade off there, right. In the windows world. So, okay.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:57.800
Interesting. Next one is, should we, should we adopt calendar versioning? We're beyond zero

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:04.760
verse. So that's really good, but there's been a reluctance to have Python four, but we've got

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:11.800
three, 12 through 13. Are we just going to have 3.1 hundred and 28 or should we come up with

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.120
something else? Right. What is calendar versioning and should we adopt it and how many digits should

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:22.680
it have? Yeah. So this was, presented on by Hugo, who is the new release manager for Python

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:28.120
three, 14 and 15, which maybe that's a little presumptive saying those numbers. cause if

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.520
this goes through, that would not be the case anymore. he's going to work himself straight

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:37.480
out of a job here. What's going on. Yeah. This is, this was, there were definitely jokes

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.560
about like, this is just your attempt to, to get out of being the release manager for these

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:49.000
releases. but yeah, that, so Hugo proposed this, what, this is kind of like a pre pep

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.680
feeling out of how this situation should be. And like trying to pare down the options, I think was

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:59.960
Hugo's biggest, biggest question was what should we do it? And should we pare down the options?

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.960
Cause there's a million different ways we can do calendar versioning. and yeah, I think if you

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.600
scroll down, there was like a slide that had just, you know, every single possible calendar

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:14.360
versioning possibility for Python and all the different languages. but yeah, calendar

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.920
versioning is like really common for programming languages and other things that are similar to

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:26.120
Python. and so this was basically like, Hey, we have this yearly release cycle that is been

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.960
working for a while and we're probably going to keep doing it. Should we pointing out for people

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.760
who don't know that it used to be 18 months. And so the calendar versioning would get a little

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.960
out of phase or something there, but now, now that it's yearly in the fall, it really lines

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.120
up perfectly. Yeah. And so this kind of assumes that we're going to keep doing the yearly thing,

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:48.600
which I'm fine with the yearly thing, but yeah, as long as we kept the yearly schedule,

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.240
it would line, like the release year would line up with whatever the, so it would be like the

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:59.400
ended, the one that was like most agreed upon was like three dot and then a two digit year,

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.640
or what would end up becoming a three digit year when we roll over to a hundred, assuming that

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:08.600
Python is still used in a hundred years. but yeah, so like that was kind of like the one that

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:13.800
was most palatable to core devs or people were most excited about. And I think the big reason

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:20.840
why switching to like a Calver year was interesting is that we have this thing called like support

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:26.600
lifetime. So like how long is CPython supported? How long do you get security fixes? How long do

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:32.120
you get bug fixes? and so being able to do the math is easier. Yeah, exactly. Like,

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:37.000
let me put this out to the audience. Is Python three eight supported or is it not supported?

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.160
I don't know. You got to do, you got to do math. You got to think about it. yeah,

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.080
so three seven just recently dropped support. Right. Which is crazy. Cause that seems like

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:50.440
a pretty new version of my mind, but it totally makes sense. but if you just knew it's

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:55.240
supported for how many years, six years, five years, it's five years for security releases,

00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:01.800
I believe. Yeah. So then you're like, it's 2025. So, you know, 2020 out, it becomes a lot easier.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:06.280
And there was also say like, do I have the current one, right? If you're not tracking it super

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:10.040
carefully, like three 11, is that the latest? Like, I don't know. I don't, I only use Python

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:15.000
every like once a month. What was the 2023? Oh, I see. Well, I mean, that's not the latest one. Okay.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.760
Yeah. Yeah. So it was just an interesting conversation about figuring out what the

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.240
best potential option was. And then Hugo ended up creating a PEP and I think that's being

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:30.680
discussed right now. So cool. Why not 2024, why 24? Because that feels, I don't know. It just

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:37.320
feels like you've just point shifted what you're doing now rather than, than really clear. Cause,

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.640
you know, as a new person coming in, you don't see that and go, it's 24. So it must be 2024.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:46.520
And unless you really like put together the calendar, but if it's a dot 2024, you're like,

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.680
I bet that's the year, you know? Right. Yeah. I mean, cause eventually the,

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.040
in the not too distant future, there will be a Python 3.24.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.760
Exactly. Yeah. We'll see. So there's going to be a pepper on this. You say, in fact,

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:03.800
it says right here, PEP 604, right? I think it's pep. What is it like?

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.800
Well, you know, that's the, just the yearly announce. You scroll down all the way to the

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.360
bottom. It'll, I think it's like peps. Yeah. There's a lot of drafting. It just says drafting

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:18.120
a pep. Give that a click. I'm pretty sure there's a number 2026. There we go. Okay. Yeah. Oh,

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.480
so that's going to be a while until they released this pep. Well, so I'm just kidding. The most,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:31.400
the most important part of this discussion was that the, the Python version 3.14 B B preserved

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:37.080
PI on, so yeah, cool. It wasn't allowed for three, three 14 to change it.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:43.000
Yeah. The only thing that I can think of that you would have the two digits is that there's a lot of

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.960
code and regular expressions and junk out there that checks for that. But you know, if we talk

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.360
about some of the other stuff out there, like that's a pretty minor change, like for example,

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:57.160
three threaded Python. Yes. Three threaded Python. It's here. It is here. Sort of,

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.920
you know, what actually really surprised me is that when I saw this PEP come through,

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:06.360
is it seven or two or something like that? It said, we're going to allow free threaded Python,

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.840
which I'm going to have you explain for folks in a moment, but you're going to have to have a special

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.720
build of it. And I thought, oh, well that means if you want to play with it, you're going to have

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.960
to build your own. But I noticed that the installers now give you an option for it.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:23.080
Yeah, they do. Yeah. The installers side by side install. Right. Yeah. The, what is it? I think

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:29.080
there's like a T that gets put onto your actual like. Yes. Python T is what you type instead of

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.600
Python. Yeah. If you want the free threaded one. Yeah. I mean, free threading is here. I mean,

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:39.240
there's options if you're compiling it yourself, you just enable some options. And I think I go

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:45.160
over that in the actual blog post too, the options that you actually use to try it out. And yeah,

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:51.160
free threading essentially is, it's a way to remove the GIL and move to a different like

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:56.680
reference counting model, object counting model. And which is quite exciting for a lot of people,

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:02.360
but it will, what it will end up meaning is that a lot of the packages that are written in C or

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:08.600
that are relying on CPython APIs will have to get either, you know, tweaked a little bit to like,

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:14.040
use these slightly different C APIs to make it so that they play nicely with having no GIL enabled

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:18.760
and with the new memory management. Yeah. It's super exciting.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:23.480
And just in the ecosystem, basically. Yeah. Just because you have threads doesn't mean you get

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:29.080
perfect scalability across the cores. Can't remember who wrote this article. Is it Simon

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:35.000
Willison? Maybe who did some, yeah, I'm pretty sure it was Simon Willison who wrote one that

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.400
said, look, we're going to take an algorithm that can, is kind of embarrassingly parallel

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:46.360
and parallelize it. And it turned out to be something like 50% gain per core. So it was

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:51.640
like he had eight cores and it was four times faster with free-threaded Python than without,

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:56.120
which is still, if you can get your code to run four times faster, that's still really good. Right.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.720
Yeah. But it's, it's going to have, like you said, I think it's going to have an interesting

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:07.960
requirement put on all the people building packages. Right. And I know when I hear people

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.760
say, I think maybe you just said like, oh, it's going to be the C extension packages that are

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:17.400
really going to have to deal with it because they, they'll have to do locks in their thing.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:23.880
I think even in the Python code, there's certainly algorithms that have multiple steps that they'll

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.320
get some data here. They'll work with the data. They'll make some changes. Then they'll put the

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:33.240
data back in the same place. And even that would be subject to a race condition. Right. And I think

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:38.920
we're, you know, I've in long in the past did a lot of C++ I did a lot of C# and in

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:43.240
communities like that, people are like always focused. They're like, oh, he's kind of crazy

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:48.520
about two things, memory and threading. Right. And we just don't do that in Python. We just,

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:56.280
I think we have just leveraged the fact that the GIL gives us kind of enough coarse grain granularity,

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.760
the execution of our code that it's just not something we hit a lot. And we don't try to do

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.880
a ton of threading because it doesn't work all that well. However, this, this could expose

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:12.120
lots of stuff. This could put a new focus on that. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Just having more people

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:17.400
using threading with Python, that that's going to be huge for finding thread safety issues.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:24.200
Yeah. It's, it's just really exciting. I think that, and there's another blog post, a completely

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:28.520
separate one that talks about like the C API. And there was some mention about like free threading

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:33.720
and evolving the API so that it's a lot easier to use from a three, a free threading perspective.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:41.000
So like there's a ton of work happening in here to make this as easy, a hopefully brief

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.600
kind of split in the ecosystem and then have it converge together. I think that's like the

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:51.080
overall plan is like, Hey, we gotta, we gotta have a way that if this is really not working out,

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:55.240
we can go back. But if it is working, we need a way that we can actually land this thing as the

00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:00.840
default. Right. Right. Right. And the PEP discusses this as like, we're gonna, we're gonna see how it

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:08.520
goes, which is really interesting. But I think it's not breaking in the sense that you can't

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:13.880
still run Python three with the thing that you've got. You just might not be able to enable this

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:20.120
free threading aspect of it for some time. Whereas from two to three, it's like, you cannot

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:26.200
run this library on three period. There's no scenario which this is going to work because

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:32.840
it needs to take into account this and it doesn't. And so it's out. So I feel like there's more time

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:37.640
and space to evolve it. And you could say, well, in this space, you know, in this data science

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:42.360
section of the world, we use these seven libraries and we're going to work and make them

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.440
compatible so that we can get way better performance or, you know, we're going to work

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:51.000
to make sure that FastAPI and pedantic support it really well so that we can scale our web servers

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.760
better. Yeah. No, this will be huge for, for like web and, and data. I think that a lot of people

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.240
are excited for this for a really good reason. Yeah. I totally agree. I totally agree. Okay.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:06.680
So this is a big deal. It's coming in three 13, but you've got to run Python T for now.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:11.320
Yeah. It's a three 13, but it's also available in the pre-releases. The first release candidate

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.720
for three 13 is out. So give it a test. If you haven't given it a test, give it a test.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:21.720
Yeah. Very cool. All right. What, what one do we want to talk about next? We got just a couple

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:28.040
more minutes to cover. We've got, what about Python and mobile? I think that one's, I know

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:35.720
there's the, the black Swan talk that Keith Russell McGee gave and Carol Willing also sort of

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:41.880
shouted out. Like there's a couple of places that are really, really important computationally in

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.600
the world that Python kind of isn't, we should have it there. And those number one has got to

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:52.760
be mobile, mobile and front end for me, mobile and front end are the two. And like a far distant

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:58.120
behind that is like, could I get a single binary out of my app that I can give to someone? That's

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:03.000
a different, that also is in there, but it's, it's like not as important as, Hey, I want to,

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.080
I want to build some mobile apps. Can I use PI? You know, I want to learn that with an easy

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:12.520
language. Chinese, ask me something else. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Like next question.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:21.560
Yeah. So this was, this was a, it's almost almost like a big status update on where Python is in the

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:26.760
mobile space, which is really exciting because they've made a ton of progress on getting like

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:33.960
actual tiering of support for these platforms. So if you don't know, Python has a like platform

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:40.680
support tiers where it's like tier one is like X 86 Linux, right? Like that's a 90% of PI PI

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:45.800
downloads are, are that like, yeah, probably want to support that one. And then as things like Mac

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:52.280
OS, you know, X 86 and arm and all of that. Right. And then lower down there's tier two, which is,

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:56.360
you know, the platforms that they have people that are interested in them. But if those people

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.760
were to go away, then we wouldn't actually have a way to support them. And tier three is like even

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:07.160
more so. Right. So having tier three support for Python, for both Android and iOS for three 13,

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:11.400
like that's super exciting. It means that these things are getting actively tested.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:16.680
There's like integration testing on real platforms and that there's people that care about it that

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:23.320
are fixing bugs. And this is exactly what you need to get your platform supported. And so this is all

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:28.600
being provided by Anaconda funding this project and be aware. Okay. Yeah, that's right. They are,

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.960
you'll be aware and Keith has been on this for a long time, but Anaconda have come along and

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.920
put more time and energy behind it in terms of funding and people as well. I'm not sure,

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.640
but certainly in funding, that's awesome. Yeah. So I think this was, it was both a

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:48.920
status report and also kind of trying to figure out how these sorts of platforms can get tested

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:55.960
more easily and like actually not having constant breaking because these platforms are so different

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:01.000
from, you know, what almost every other core developer is using to develop a Python or a lot

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.880
more limited in terms of capabilities and like lockdown and the security perspective too.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:11.240
And they have no regard for backwards compatibility. I'd so frustrating. I, I got,

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:17.160
I, you know, I have mobile apps for the talk Python courses that are in both iOS and Android

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:23.800
app stores and I'll get messages like, Hey, dear developer, if we see that you're built against

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:29.000
three-year-old APIs, if you don't rebuild and republish your app in the next six months,

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.360
we're taking it out. The last one I had to do this for was Google. I'm like three,

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:38.440
three years. Okay. Can we, no, it can't get any better compatibility than that. Like I just got

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.440
to keep re-uploading the same thing, even if there's no changes. Like, so, you know, that's

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.200
just a different mentality of like, ah, we changed all that. We don't like that anymore.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:51.320
Yeah. Luckily I'm, I'm actually not sure how affected Python in particular is by things

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:58.360
like that. Cause that's like utilizing APIs, like mobile SDK APIs versus like the operating system

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:03.080
of the phone, which, yeah, right. Like people would build apps with Python and then they would

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.400
be subjected to these emails. And it's not even that I was necessarily using any of those APIs.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.240
It's just like, we see you're compiled against the wrong version. So try again, you know?

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:16.840
Yeah, no, the, yeah, the, the difficulties that I've at least from, from this talk have figured

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.720
out is that like these platforms are just a lot more locked down. So like a lot of system calls

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:26.600
won't be available that the test suite like assumes are available always. And sure.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.600
It's almost like a circuit Python sort of deal, but not that extreme.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:35.960
It's like, yeah, it's like somewhere in the middle and figuring out how to all work together happily

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.440
and develop on this similar code base that has all these different target platforms.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:45.800
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Awesome. Well, I'm, I'm really excited. I'm all here for it. If

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.440
three years ago, I think it was when we started working on those mobile apps, if I could have

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:55.320
used Python in a really solid way, a hundred percent, those apps to be built in Python, but

00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:01.560
just, there's so many, so much tooling and stuff around. Oh, you got to create a signed APK before

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:06.040
you upload. There's a lot of stuff going on there. And so hopefully they, they get that. That would

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:11.640
be, be a game changer and just, you know, it's not on, it wasn't here. Almost surprised me that it

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:17.960
wasn't here, but front end stuff, WebAssembly, PyScripts, Pyodide, all those things I think are

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:22.440
in that same realm. Although they can just kind of ship stuff to the web because there's no gate

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:28.120
keepers, but still. Yeah. Was that mentioned anywhere during the summit that just didn't make

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:36.280
a post? No, Wasm was not, there was no topic about Wasm specifically at, at this language summit.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.880
Yeah, sure. I think there was the previous year. Previous year there was. Yeah.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.960
Should we make PDB better? Does this matter? Are people using PDB? What do you think?

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:49.960
Yeah. So this, this was all about, PDB is Python's debugger for people that don't know. If you've

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:55.800
never used it, it lets you kind of like drop into, set a break point in Python and then drop into

00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.120
that exact spot with all the context and everything, which is really. At a lower level. Yeah.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:05.800
At a lower level than VS Code or PyCharm. Right. Exactly. Like seeing all these like super

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:11.320
internals of Python, if that, if that's something that you really need. Right. And so this was a

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:18.760
talk that was mostly about, okay, we're, we have PDB, but now we have all of these new models,

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:24.200
like free threading and all of that. And also we're being a little bit held back by backwards

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:30.200
compatibility. There's like a specific, really specific point where because of backwards

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:36.280
compatibility reasons and PDB is a part of the Python standard library, it becomes difficult

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.840
to break backwards compatibility, even if it would mean you get a bunch of really good stuff out of

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:46.040
it. You can't always do that because people are depending on it. And I think that the, yeah,

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.680
the recommendation was maybe we should develop this outside of the standard library so we can,

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:56.120
you know, break backwards compatibility if it's not necessary and, and make it so that we can

00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:01.320
support multiple versions instead of just having it be per version. And yeah. Yeah. That's, that's

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:05.160
a good idea. That's exactly what I was thinking. Cause you know, there's the whole dead batteries

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.440
talk like, does this still belong here? I'm not necessarily thinking this should not be in Python,

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:16.360
but you know, yeah. Something broken out maybe, but take that exact code, break it out, but,

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:22.120
you know, enhance it kind of independently. Yeah. And I think the concern from, from some people in

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:26.360
the room was that, Oh, if we break this out onto pipe, AI, then it would potentially mean that it

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:32.120
would not get the same level of contribution that PDBC is because it's part of Python. Right. Sure.

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:38.280
And I mean, totally valid in my opinion too, like being a part of Python is a huge, like blessing

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:44.040
of like, yeah, this is something important. Right. But I, I think that there's, there's other ways to

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:48.200
signal that that's something important. Like if you look at like my pie, my pie is underneath the

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:54.520
Python GitHub organization. And so maybe something like that, right. Where it's this tool that is

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:58.920
very actively used by core developers for development. And it is a little bit more

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:03.240
official than, you know, just some random person putting something up on pipe. Yeah. This is core

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:08.600
developers supporting this. And black is that way too, I believe, right? It is. Yeah. So maybe

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:13.320
something to signal just a little bit more of an official, this is a core developer tool. Here's

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:17.560
why you should contribute to it instead of just, you know, a random project on pipe guy, which

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:22.760
definitely wouldn't be in that case. It would not, it would definitely not. All right. How about,

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:29.160
how about a quick review of maybe some, some of the lightning talks? Yeah. Any of these stand out?

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:38.120
You know, obviously Rust and Python is seriously a one. Yeah. Emily's talk was, yeah. Emily's got

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:43.480
a good one. Emily has a really good one because, and this is like, it's, it's almost meta, right?

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:49.960
Because lightning talks are not submitted ahead of time. You actually have to submit them during

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:54.920
other people's talks, like to the list that you want to talk about this and then put together

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:58.520
some slides really quickly. So yeah, these talks are pretty impressive in that way,

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:05.640
having mere minutes, but the Emily's talk was about, it was kind of like wrapping up a theme

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:09.320
that was being heard multiple times over the course of the language summit. But obviously

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:14.840
this is a problem outside of the language summit too, which is that when someone goes to make a

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:21.400
prototype for a pep, they are given at least today, not a whole lot of support for doing that

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.880
prototype because it's basically like, Oh, we think that this should be developed outside of

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:32.040
the standard library. Initially, right? Like that's a really common determination that the steering

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:40.040
council comes to. And so being able to have kind of like a standardized way that people do a pep

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:45.000
prototype outside of the standard library. So things like creating a repo and like having all

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:51.320
of this existing infrastructure set up and maybe even hosting it under the Python GitHub organization

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:56.120
to give it some like air of officiality of like, yeah, this is something like really big is

00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.600
happening here. It's not just like someone in a corner writing something right. Like giving some

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:05.960
more grandiosity to, to the work that's being done and not just kind of saying, Oh, go away.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:10.200
Like that is the intention. Right. But that's kind of how it can land sometimes.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:14.520
Right. And maybe setting up people for success, at least this is what we're going to expect from

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.920
you. If you go through this process, then you've got, you're further down the pipeline of having

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.800
that conversation for a pep. Yeah, definitely. And like, if you're

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:27.960
wanting to write something that is for Python, you know, you probably don't necessarily care

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:33.480
about like setting up these exact workflows for publishing to PyPI. Like that's just a whole bunch

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.600
of things that are in your way to actually being successful. So having that all be figured out

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.640
already ahead of time for you makes things a lot easier for you.

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:48.440
Yep. Yep. Yep. Let's, let's finish it out with Yuri Silvanov's presentation, efficient data sharing

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:53.640
between sub-interpreters. And it's interesting because we talked about free threaded Python,

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:59.320
but the year before the big news was sub-interpreters and Eric Snow's work. And

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:04.440
those are not directly competing type of things, but in a sense they're kind of competing.

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:10.440
Yeah. They're definitely competing for being like the, the model of how to do efficient,

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.880
you know, parallelism in Python. Yeah. Yeah. How do we isolate the stuff

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:18.680
so that we can avoid the guilt? We take it out and add different algorithms or do we just

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:22.760
make copies of the interpreter and run them in isolation, but then you have this

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:27.880
data sharing issue. I can't just share a pointer easily. Right. So what's this about?

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:34.600
Yeah. So Yuri basically came with, and this was also if you want the extended version,

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:39.880
Yuri also gave like an actual PyCon talk about this library that he's developed called Memhive.

00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.360
What's it called? Memhive.

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.600
Like M-E-M-H-I-V-E. Yeah.

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:48.760
All right. Awesome. And just for everyone listening just this week, last week,

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:53.320
recently, all the videos of all the talks are now available on YouTube. So it's been a while

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.840
coming, but you can go watch it now. Exactly. So go watch them all. If you,

00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:01.560
if you missed out on a talk, go watch them. But yeah, this, so this library in particular is,

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:07.800
it's basically a way using immutable data structures. There's this immutable data

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:13.240
structure called an H-A-M-T. I actually don't know what it's short for, but it's a hash,

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:20.040
hash array map tree. There we go. It was in the, I wrote it down. And it's essentially like a way

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:28.120
to have this tree that can be passed around and shared without like worrying what the other

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:32.520
processes, sub-interpreters are. They're not processes. The other sub-interpreters are doing

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:38.680
to the status structure. So it enables a more efficient and safe way of sharing data. That's

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:43.320
kind of like in a tree structure. And I think one, the demo that he ended up giving was about

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:48.120
a dictionary-like data structure where, you know, you have a million keys and a bunch of

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:53.160
sub-interpreter workers working on that data. And they're able to, because it is using this

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:57.960
immutable data structure, the modifications and changes are all safe, but it's also like super

00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:03.160
scalable and performant. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The thing about parallelism and multi-threading is

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:06.600
if it's immutable, you can have many things that you want reading from the same memory. It's only

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:11.000
when they start writing, does it matter? So yeah. Yeah. This, this like has a way,

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.680
a mechanism to capture the rights in a way that is safe so that like the current one can see

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:22.040
what has been written and then the other ones aren't affected because their copy is not changed.

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:27.800
Okay. That sounds very interesting. We talked about the coming compatibility matrix of free

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:33.480
threaded Python. This won't have that issue, right? This operates in the every version of Python.

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:38.040
Yeah. So this, I would assume that this sort of module would be able to say like,

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:44.280
I am ready for a GIL free world. So that's like the mechanism that I believe CPython has,

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:50.120
has adopted for saying that your C module is ready for not having a gill. You actually have

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:55.160
to opt into it. And then that module will, will be allowed to run in a free threaded Python.

00:57:55.160 --> 00:58:00.040
Yeah. It's something I recently learned is there's separate wield builds for free threaded

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:05.560
Python as well. Yeah. That's, that's interesting. Yeah. It's its own, I don't know exactly the

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:11.000
phrase for it, but yeah, it's own wheel tag platform target or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Like

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:18.440
free threaded gets appended to Mac iOS arm 64 or whatever. Exactly. Yeah. Awesome. All right,

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:22.520
Seth, this has been great. How about some parting thoughts? Let's close this out with just

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:28.360
takeaways from, from the whole experience. Yeah. I mean, the language summit is lovely.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.640
One of the things that's like most important to me is like this whole aspect of storytelling. And

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:38.120
so that's why I felt really, really happy that I was invited along to be able to tell these stories

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:43.240
to all of you. And I think that having all of these different narratives all in one place of

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:48.600
all of these huge themes about what Python is going through all at once, right? Like it's

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:55.320
really incredible how many different things are happening in Python all at once. And like

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:59.560
sometimes when you're focusing on just one or just two, you know, you don't have this huge

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:04.200
context of, wow, Python is changing in like at least 20 different ways all at once. And we're

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:09.720
somehow doing really, really well. I would say like, yeah, I have no doubt about any of any of

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:14.280
these huge changes that Python is going through, like to, to take it in the wrong direction. Like

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:18.840
I'm feeling hopeful and excited about all of them. So it's an exciting time. Yeah, I am as well. And

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:24.520
it is really tricky to get a picture, a holistic picture of, of the progress. Cause there's a lot

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:30.920
of different groups doing different things and there's no one person's or one company's job to

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:34.680
get somebody to come and tell that story. So yeah, thanks for giving us the insight here.

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.600
It's been awesome. Yeah. Thanks for being on the show and I'm sure we'll have you back soon.
