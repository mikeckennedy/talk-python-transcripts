Are you interested in data science, but you're not quite working in it yet?

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.340
In software, getting that very first job can truly be the hardest one to land.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.560
On this episode, we have Avery Smith from Data Career Jumpstart here to share his advice

Hey folks, before we jump in and talk about data science jobs and careers, I want to tell you

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.680
really quickly about some awesome news. Back in February, I gave the keynote at PyCon Philippines.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.140
It was entitled The State of Python in 2024. Well, that is now out on YouTube. The team at

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.340
PyCon Philippines did a great job. The video came out great. If you want to check out The

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.060
State of Python in 2024, according to me, just click on the link in the show notes to watch

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.740
it over on YouTube. Now let's talk to Avery. Avery, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.160
Thanks so much. I'm so excited to be here and be part of the show.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.780
I'm excited to have you here as well. You know, one of the things that people reach out to me often

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.300
is how do you get into data science? How do you get into programming? How do you get into Python?

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.940
You know, I've been trying, or maybe they got a degree or they took some training program,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.940
bootcamp or something. And going from zero to one, I think is the biggest career step you have to make.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.340
That next job and the one after that, it only gets to be smaller steps, not bigger steps.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.840
And it's really tough because that first big step, you're brand new at it. You have no experience,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.860
right? It's your first data science job or your first programming job. And so hopefully we can

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.380
give some folks out there a little bit of a hand up to help them make that jump.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.800
Yeah, totally. I like to show this graphic that says, it's a circle and it's a circle of text. And it says,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.580
I can't get a job because I don't have experience because, and then it restarts,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.980
I can't get a job. And that's the tricky part. It's like, how do you get a data science job when

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.720
you have no data science experience? Because to get data science experience, that seems like you have

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.920
to have a job as the prerequisite and vice versa. So it is very tricky. So happy to chime in on that

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.100
today.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.340
The industry can take it too far. They can take it way too far. So a few years ago, there was a

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.280
really funny tweet that went around back when they call them tweets. I don't know what they're called

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:44.620
anymore. Sebastian Ramirez, the guy who created FastAPI, saw a job posting. When FastAPI was like a

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.160
year and a half old, it said, you must have four years of experience with FastAPI to apply. He said,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.900
hey, look, I'm the creator of FastAPI and I'm unqualified for this job. What kind of world are

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.520
we living in?

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.980
Yeah. I don't want to live in that world, but that's unfortunately where we're at. That's so tough.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.220
And it's hilarious. These job descriptions are getting out of hand. That's for sure.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.420
Yeah. Well, with AI, it's probably not going to get better.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.400
We could talk about that more later. But before we get into that, let's just jump in with a little

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.600
bit of background on you before we get to the topic. Tell us a bit about yourself. What do you do?

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.160
How'd you get into Python? Things like that.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.620
Yeah, absolutely. So I'm currently a data science consultant and also a data science instructor.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.140
I run some online programs where I teach people to become data analysts mostly is what I'm focused on.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.260
But I also have this practice where I help companies solve data problems with different techniques.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.480
I started actually by studying chemical engineering in college in my undergraduate degree.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.660
And about a semester in, I realized, crap, I hate this. This is not for me.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.280
But I was a little on a little of a tough. Yeah. Do you agree? Have you felt something similar?

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.160
I did a semester of chemical engineering as well. I thought, I love chemistry. I love math. Put them

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.560
together. Somehow they don't go together. It's like ice cream and eggs or something. No,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.140
they don't go together for me at least.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.180
Yeah. It wasn't good for me either. I was just like, oh man, I'm actually not interested

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.480
in refineries or like manufacturing. But I, like you, liked chemistry. I liked math. I thought this

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.060
is perfect. But I quickly realized, oh man, I really liked this whole programming part that I get to do

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.300
in MATLAB at the time when I was an undergrad. And I was on a time crunch to get through college kind of

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.720
quickly through eight semesters. And the other issue I had was I didn't know what to do instead. It was

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.940
like, I don't really want to study computer science. Part of the reason why is they kind of

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.840
had this weed out course at the beginning, which you had to build Excel from scratch, basically like

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.620
some sort of a spreadsheeting tool. And I was like, why would I rebuild something that already exists

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.440
that I don't even like using in the first place? I wasn't really into it. So I didn't, I didn't know

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.920
what to do. And luckily I was working as a lab technician at this company, the really cool company

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.880
that makes the sensors that basically have the ability to smell. So they can sniff what's in

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.300
the air and it has applications for finding drugs or bombs and airports and stuff like that.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.780
And there was a data scientist on staff and that data scientist was awesome. He was like showing me

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.280
all these cool algorithms he was writing for these sensors. And then one day he got up and left and he

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.000
left the company and we tried to hire another data scientist for like six months, but they were really

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.520
expensive. We were a small company and none of them really wanted to move to Utah where I lived in

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.800
Salt Lake City. And so we couldn't, we couldn't really find someone that would be able to do it.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.120
And so finally I was like, well, I really liked this programming stuff. And I, you know, the data

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.500
scientist showed me a thing or two, maybe I could take a stab at this. And I started, I wrote like my

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.980
first machine learning algorithm and I was like, oh my gosh, I'm addicted to this. And then I never

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.440
looked back and had been data science since basically.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.100
What a great story. Yeah. I think, I think a lot of people fall into programming that way. And for some reason,

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.720
not unexpectedly, but for some reason, a lot of people fall into Python that way as well. They're

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.900
like, you know, I have a job and I got this thing I got to do. I just need a little bit more than maybe

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.200
like an Excel spreadsheet or something and put it together. And you're like, actually, this is cool.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.700
After a while, like, this is cooler than what I've been doing, or maybe I'll make it a good part of what

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.300
I do. Right.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.860
Yeah. A hundred percent. Even just making, it was in MATLAB, which is basically engineers version

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:26.380
of Python or college version of Python 10 years ago. Right. And I made like tic-tac-toe and I remember

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.620
playing tic-tac-toe against the computer. I think that's what it was. Or maybe it was,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.540
maybe it was Hangman. I can't remember. But I remember like the idea of like being able to play,

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.800
to program games and play against the computer. And I built it. I was like, this is the coolest thing

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.280
ever. I got to, I got to do more of this.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.780
Absolutely. You know, I think I've done some MATLAB too, when I was younger and it's not that

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.660
different from Python, but it's, I think one of the big differences other than it just being like

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.460
embedded in a big expensive app is it's not a general purpose programming language, right? You

00:07:54.460 --> 00:08:00.380
wouldn't go, you know, that was fun, but let me go build this website in MATLAB or let me create

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:06.220
Airbnb and MATLAB or, you know, like there's, you just don't want to sort, Azure has this like

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.860
self-prescribed limit to what you can do with it.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.740
That's one of the coolest parts about Python is it's really a Swiss army knife and you can pretty

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.100
much do, I don't want to say anything, but pretty close to anything in Python, which makes it really

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.660
neat. And obviously one of the huge limitations of MATLAB is one, it costs thousands of dollars,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.020
but two, you're right. It's not going to do cybersecurity for you. It's not going to build

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.300
websites, but the syntax at the end of the day was, was really quick. It was, it was easy for me to

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.980
transition from MATLAB to Python because the syntax isn't all that different.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:41.260
No, it's not all that different. More math focused, but pretty similar. So I think maybe that's a good

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.220
place to start discussing and exploring the topic of your first data science job. And

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.860
wouldn't necessarily plan on starting here, but let's, let's start with before you even necessarily know

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:57.660
programming language, right? Maybe you've dabbled in MATLAB or you've dabbled in Excel or even dabbled in,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.700
I don't know, JavaScript or something. This thing we've been talking about with MATLAB and it applies to other areas as well,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.940
like through programming languages per se, like Julia or something like that, is how,

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:16.220
if you invest your time into learning one of these things really well, like how broadly industry-wide

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:21.420
of a skill, high demand skill is that going to be, right? If you learn MATLAB, you put yourself in a box,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.420
you learn a more general programming language, you kind of have more options afterwards, right?

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:31.260
Yeah, totally. I think like the more broad of a language you learn, the more useful you are to,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:37.180
to more industries in general. But I might take that even a step further and just say, you know,

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:43.340
learning MATLAB, not a whole lot of companies use MATLAB, but just like landing your first data job,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:48.460
going from zero to one is the hardest, learning your first language, zero to one is the hardest as well.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.940
And then once you have that first language, the next language becomes so much easier. So

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.740
one of the first things I learned was MATLAB. And then I moved to Python and that was easier. And then

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.540
I learned SQL and then I learned R and then I learned JavaScript. And every time I added like a new tool

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.820
to my toolkit, it was quite, not almost, it was easy, but it got easier with each one. I think that's true

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.940
with foreign languages as well. Once you learn one foreign language, then the third and the fourth become

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.980
quite easy. At least that's, that's what I heard. I speak kind of through two and a half languages,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.500
but like I, there's people who speak like seven and they always say like the sixth and the seventh

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.060
become easier.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.340
Yeah. You wonder how could you probably, because learning the first one is so hard,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.420
first foreign language. So you're like, well, how could you possibly take that on for this many

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.300
languages? And it's that it's not the same challenge each time, right?

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:32.860
Yeah, exactly.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:38.140
Yeah. So I think when people are considering getting into data science, they really want to consider

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.540
what language they choose and where they go. Like you're coming out of a

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.020
college program. You might feel like MATLAB or something like that's real popular. And yet

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:51.740
that's because it's popular amongst professors who forced their students to do it. That doesn't

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:57.020
necessarily mean that's the world, the broad worldview. What do you think about R? You know, both.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:03.020
I like R. I'm not, I sometimes troll R on LinkedIn. So I guess that's another thing I should say is I post

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.700
a lot on LinkedIn, kind of a LinkedIn guy. And so a lot of the times, honestly, just for jokes and kicks

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.180
and giggles, I'll kind of roast R on LinkedIn just to get the trolls angry in the comments.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:18.780
I've invented it. It's quite fun. It's quite a fun experience, but I'm not that big of a hater. I

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.180
think that's really interesting about R versus Python is obviously a big debate in the data

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:29.420
science community is R is kind of that does one thing really well. And it's getting a little less

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.860
of that as like more packages and libraries are added to R, but R does the statistics and machine

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.660
learning very well. But obviously I don't think once again, I don't know any websites, any like

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.060
super functioning websites that are built on R. I don't know any cybersecurity that's really done

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:49.580
done, done VR. So I think R does what it does well. The syntax sometimes is a lot easier for

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.540
people to go from Excel, which a lot of people are more familiar with in the finance or banking world,

00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:00.460
for example. The syntax in R is a little bit more similar to those Excel formulas than it is to Python.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.540
So I think sometimes people have a little bit more success just because, oh, this kind of feels like

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:10.140
our formulas are sorry. This feels like Excel formulas. And so people really get there. I think what

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.700
you're kind of alluding to is if you're going to learn one skill, you might as well learn the one

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:20.220
skill that's applicable to the most, the widest net, right? And so that way you're fishing in the

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:27.260
biggest lake you possibly could versus in a smaller pond of R. I think that's worth looking at. And one

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.180
of the things I actually really enjoy doing, because you know, you mentioned, oh, you might think MATLAB

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.580
is popular because that's what the professors taught you. And there's actually not a whole lot of

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:41.100
data out there about, well, what should you learn? So I don't know if you know who Luke Bruce is. He's a data

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.580
analyst YouTuber. I was going to say YouTuber on YouTube, but that's kind of redundant on YouTube. And

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.940
one of the things he's done is he's actually built this tool where he's web scraping thousands of jobs,

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:56.780
different data jobs every week, and then displaying and analyzing the skills required for those jobs.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:01.340
So it's actually like a data driven way of saying, if you want to be a data scientist, what skills should you

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:07.660
actually be focusing on as you go, as opposed to just listening to what a professor will say,

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:13.820
or what a LinkedIn influencer will say, or what your bootcamp will say. Like actually getting some

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:19.660
data on, I think is pretty neat. That is super cool. And I'm not familiar with Luke. So we're going to dig

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.420
him up and put him in the show notes for later so people can check that out. For sure. Do you remember

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.980
any of the trends you've recently talked about? It's datanerd.tech, I think is the website there.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:33.180
I look at it mostly for data analysts because that's who I work with the most. So I know the

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:40.460
data analyst data very well. SQL is number one at 50%. I think Python is number two at like 30%.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:47.180
I think Python might've jumped it. Well, this is for all data positions right here. So the job title,

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.180
you can choose. So which one do you think I should pick here? Data?

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.820
Maybe data scientist. Data scientist. Yeah. Right.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.380
What's that? Yeah, you're right. Wow.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:04.060
Whoa, Python 69%. Look at that. That's huge. So like, that's even, that's even what? 20% more than SQL,

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.020
which a lot of people are like, if you were going to be a data scientist, you have to know SQL.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:11.660
Yeah. If you look at the job descriptions, Python's mentioned a lot more. So if you're going to learn,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.420
if you're brand new and you're going to learn one, you might as well start with Python. Because that's

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.460
probably the most in demand skill that there is right now for a data scientist.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.860
Yeah. And it's pretty easy, right? It's not like, well, why don't you just learn C++ for

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.700
embedded devices? You're like, you know what? Maybe I'll pick something else to start with. Right. But

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.020
you know, Python's pretty easy. I agree with you. I think Python's great. I actually think,

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.980
I think SQL is probably easier to learn if I'm being honest, because really, especially for like

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.380
data science stuff, there's only about like 20 commands that you need to know in SQL. But it's,

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.780
once again, SQL's a lot more, there's no websites built on SQL. I'll tell you that much. So

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.380
it's a lot more limited on what it can do.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:52.060
It's a skill, but not the language. It's not enough on its own, generally. I mean,

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:57.100
you can do reports and quite a bit with it. But you know, it's like, when you see these programming

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.700
popularity, like what's the most popular language? Oh, look, CSS is the third most popular. That's not

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.700
a language. That's a thing that you use with other languages, right? Like use it with all the other

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.180
languages. That's why it's high up. But that doesn't mean it's high in demand. Exactly. It's just like

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.780
table stakes, you know? Yeah.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:17.020
So you kind of got to distinguish table stakes from like picking an area, I think.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:22.700
That's totally true. And really, I think Pythonistas could make the argument that there's

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:28.060
really nothing in SQL that you couldn't do in Python. That's a little somewhat true,

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.940
true depending on data size and stuff like that. But regardless, there is ways that you can do

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.140
most of the SQL commands in Python one way or another. Yeah. Yeah.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:41.980
It could be when I first became a data scientist, I didn't even know SQL and I was doing SQL commands

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:47.020
or I was doing the aggregations or the where functions or the window functions using Python.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:51.260
So you definitely can. As long as your data is not like super big, then you'll totally be fine.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:57.660
Right. Like some kind of generator or even slices or yeah, things like that, right? List comprehensions,

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.940
set comprehensions, all that kind of stuff. Kind of like, gosh, I really wish, a little bit of a

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:08.620
sidebar, but I wish like list comprehensions and all those things had just a few more SQL features,

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:14.060
right? Like in a list comprehension, I say, give me this thing, maybe give me this property of this class

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:20.620
modified, like give me the user's name, uppercase. Right. So that's like select. And then for thing

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:27.020
in collection, that's like from table or whatever. Right. And then you have the where clause with the

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:33.820
if statement, but boy, wouldn't it be cool to have like a sort also in there and other things like that,

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.460
you know? Oh, well, totally. It's so close. The cool thing is, is if you want that sort,

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.740
it's what one extra line. Like it's, it's not, it's not too bad. So it, Python, I mean,

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.820
I don't want to say this necessarily to hate all, to make all the data scientists and SQL lovers

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.540
mad, but, but really Python can do a lot of the things that SQL that's for sure.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.340
Yeah, that's for sure.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:17:00.380
This portion of talk Python to me is brought to you by Sentry code breaks. It's a fact of life with Sentry.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:06.860
You can fix it faster. As I've told you all before, we use Sentry on many of our apps and APIs here at

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:12.780
Talk Python. I recently used Sentry to help me track down one of the weirdest bugs I've run into in a long

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:19.340
time. Here's what happened. When signing up for our mailing list, it would crash under a non-common execution

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:25.100
past, like situations where someone was already subscribed or entered an invalid email address or

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:32.460
something like this. The bizarre part was that our logging of that unusual condition itself was crashing.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:39.020
How is it possible for her log to crash? It's basically a glorified print statement. Well, Sentry to the

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:44.300
rescue. I'm looking at the crash report right now, and I see way more information than you'd expect to

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.860
find in any log statement. And because it's production, debuggers are out of the question.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:56.700
I see the traceback, of course, but also the browser version, client OS, server OS, server OS version,

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.660
whether it's production or Q and A, the email and name of the person signing up. That's the person who

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:06.220
actually experienced the crash. Dictionaries of data on the call stack and so much more. What was the

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:14.300
problem? I initialized the logger with the string info for the level rather than the enumeration dot info,

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:20.220
which was an integer based enum. So the logging statement would crash saying that I could not use

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:27.820
less than or equal to between strings and ints. Crazy town. But with Sentry, I captured it, fixed it,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:33.900
and I even helped the user who experienced that crash. Don't fly blind. Fix code faster with Sentry.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:39.340
Create your Sentry account now at talkpython.fm/sentry. And if you sign up with the code

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:46.060
TALKPYTHON, all capital, no spaces, it's good for two free months of Sentry's business plan,

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.900
which will give you up to 20 times as many monthly events as well as other features.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:57.660
Probably the biggest, it's a bit of a diversion, but the biggest similarity to that I've seen in

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:04.460
the languages is C#'s link where they actually have almost all the query operators, including

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.580
joins and stuff like that built into the programming language. I'd love to see more of that kind of

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.420
inspiration into Python, but you know, that's all right. It's still really good. I've got a lot of

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.900
cool SQL-like features, but you're right. Once you are no longer working with data and memory,

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:24.700
or you want indexes, right? Like this concept of indexes is not sufficiently well understood. I think

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:28.940
every time I hit a website that takes five seconds to load, I'm like, somebody is not doing all the

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:34.220
things they should be doing. I just know it. That's totally true. What about SQL? You know,

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:40.460
let's talk about that for a bit, right? The SQL, the query language or databases and other things,

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:47.580
there's ways to SQL query, not just relational databases. But you said you got away with not

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:52.300
quite learning that, but do you think if you could start over, maybe making an effort to learn that

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.780
would be really valuable? Like how, how important is this a thing in the beginning of your career?

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:03.100
The interesting thing, you know, about landing a data job is your skills only plays, I say,

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:09.020
a third of the role. Your portfolio or the way that you portray your skills and your network,

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.460
I think are the other two thirds and they're actually more important than your skills. And that's

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:17.260
kind of how I got away with not knowing SQL and not even being, to be honest, that good at

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:24.060
Python at the time was because I used my network to be in the situation to get my lab technician job

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.700
in the first place. And then once again, I use that same network, in this case, my coworkers,

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.980
to land that first data scientist position after we couldn't hire anyone. And if I would have been

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:39.420
applying externally for that role, chances are I wouldn't have gotten that role. I probably didn't

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:43.900
know enough at the time to land that type of a role, but because they knew I was hardworking,

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:49.180
they knew I wasn't like a total idiot and I really liked to learn. They took that chance on me. It

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.900
paid off really well for them because at the time I was still in college. And so I wasn't getting paid

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:58.460
that much. And I was getting, I was not getting paid like a data scientist, but I was getting results like

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.260
a data scientist for them. So I think it was, it paid off for both of us. But I think if that was an

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.500
external job and I applied for it, I probably didn't have enough skills for it. So I definitely think

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.620
learning SQL, if you want to land data science job, isn't a bad place to start, especially because,

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.420
like I said, there, I mean, any programming language, I like to think of like the iceberg,

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.740
kind of like the Titanic, right? There's the parts that you see, and then there's the parts that you,

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.860
that you don't even know that you, that are there. And, and really you could spend the rest of your life

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.500
trying to master SQL or the rest of your life trying to learn Python. But the cool thing is,

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.620
is a lot of the time you only need that top little bit that's sitting at the,

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:40.060
the top of the surface of the water to actually get stuff done. And so for SQL, I think that's like

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:45.420
20 commands. And I think you could learn it honestly in like a month, you could learn those,

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.980
those 20 commands pretty easily, but it worked out for me. And I, I didn't have to use it that much

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.620
at the time until I was probably about almost three years into my job. And I actually had switched jobs

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.940
to a bigger company. The other thing that I was working for a smaller company where we didn't have a ton

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:05.020
of data. So we could use CSVs kind of as our, our database, which is not great practice. But when I,

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:09.340
when I eventually became a data scientist at Exxon mobile, I was going to say they didn't use Excel as

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.460
a database, but they still did. But the point is they had much larger SQL databases with hundreds of

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.740
thousands, actually millions of rows of data that I had to query.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.620
Yeah. Then you gotta be really, you need to understand it at a much deeper level. You're

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.700
like, if you do a query like this, it's going to be super slow. But if you do it like that,

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.060
it can use the composite index for the sort and then blah, blah, blah, blah. All right. Then

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.740
you're getting to the bottom of the, the iceberg in SQL, or maybe not the bottom,

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.500
maybe like the middle chunk under the water, but there's so much to learn for both of them.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:42.300
Amir at the audience asks, you know, like when you talk data job, like what kind of jobs are out

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.700
there? Right. So we talked to both about how we did chemical engineering and then we saw like

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.420
chemical factories, like, yeah, I don't really want to work here anymore. I'm out.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:55.740
So thinking about like, well, what are the kinds of jobs you do? I think that's really important because

00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:02.220
it's easy to get focused in on like the FANG companies. Like I want to work for like some super

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:07.660
big tech company. I want to move to San Francisco and like that, that, that, right. Like there's not just

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.140
plenty of other jobs, but the opportunities, just like you described, and as well as

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:17.260
like my first job, I worked at a company that had like eight people and it was awesome. Right.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:22.620
They didn't expect me to be, you know, running Kubernetes clusters and doing all sorts of great.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.140
They're just like, I need you to make this thing happen. Can you do like, I'm pretty new,

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:30.700
but that thing I can make that happen. Like, let's go. Right. And I feel like the, the possibilities

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:37.180
to get in, especially with these maybe more niche type of industries and companies might even be easier

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.980
for a first job. People seem to be really obsessed with, with the FANG. And I don't know if that's

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:46.300
like a societal thing, or if it's just, those are the companies that we use a lot. And so we're

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:51.500
excited about them, but yeah, there's so many more data jobs outside of FANG than there are inside of

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:57.100
FANG, even though there's, there's quite a bit inside of FANG. And oftentimes those roles can be

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:02.300
much more interesting and you can do a lot bigger of an impact. When, when I was working at the small

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:08.540
company, VaporSense, I like, I had so much power. I didn't even realize it. I had such a big effect on the

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:14.700
company. I was presenting to, you know, Fortune 500 companies and what I did really made a difference.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:20.460
And when it came to the point where ExxonMobil offered me to go be a data scientist for Exxon,

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:26.220
I said, Oh, I want to go work for the big company with the nice desk and the nice laptop and, you know,

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:31.820
try something new. And when I got there, I really, I had some pretty cool opportunities when I was at

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:36.620
ExxonMobil, but ultimately I left pretty shortly after two years of being there because I just felt like a

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.620
cog in the machine and I didn't feel like I was actually making a difference. And that was really

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:45.820
important to my work satisfaction of like, is what I'm doing being used? Is it being used to better the

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.300
world? Do I feel valued? And the answer was kind of no for me when I was there. So there's definitely

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.220
a trade-off between the small companies and the big companies, but also to go back to your original

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:59.820
question, there's so many freaking roles in the data world that you're not even thinking of that. Like,

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:04.140
I'm not even thinking of, I saw a new one the other day when I was helping one of my students.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.060
It was like, it wasn't data janitor, but it was something like that where I was like, I don't

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:12.860
even know what that role is, but there's, there's so many roles. When I was, when I was a data scientist,

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:19.180
VaporSense, the small company, my actual title was junior chemometrician, which basically means

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:24.060
you're doing data science with chemistry. When I was at ExxonMobil, when I was first there,

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:29.020
I was doing data science, but my actual title was optimization engineer. And so there's so many

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.660
titles that we don't even think to search of, or even to look up, but those are all data science

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.820
roles. I was doing machine learning every day in both those roles. And you would maybe never guess

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:42.700
from those titles. Yeah. You would never guess. No, that's awesome. What machine learning libraries,

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.220
frameworks were you using? At VaporSense, once again, because it's a smaller company,

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:51.020
I had a lot more say in what I was doing. We were building a bunch of machine, we were building

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:56.700
classification models to basically to take the data from our sensors and sniff if something was in the

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:02.940
air. Sometimes that was a yes, no, like, oh yes, there is ammonia in the semiconductor factory and

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:09.420
that's bad. So that's a yes classification kind of binary, right? Other times it was, what drug is this?

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:15.420
Is this meth or is this heroin? One of the use cases we had was, this is binary once again, but is this

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:20.380
recreational marijuana or medicinal marijuana? And can we tell the difference between, between those?

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:26.780
So we are usually using classification models, usually built in scikit-learn in Python, the majority of the

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:32.700
time there. When I was at Exxon, we had a lot less say, like the data scientists had a lot less say in

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:39.340
the decision making process. We were doing a lot of multivariate linear regression with a lot of crazy

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:44.220
hacks and transformations kind of in the meantime for one of my positions there. And then the other time,

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:50.220
the other position I did there, we were doing a lot of auto ML using PyCaret and letting it kind of

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.700
decide what type of models to do. So. Okay. The unsupervised learning type stuff, huh?

00:26:54.700 --> 00:27:00.460
It was awesome. It was really fun to, to, I love PyCaret because it's like, okay, go make 25 models and

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.820
tell me which one's the best. It's like, takes, makes my job easy, I guess.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:08.940
We're going to be creative with sheer numbers. That's how we're going to come up with a solution.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.980
Got it. Exactly.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:16.060
Well, Diego is asking like, what are some of the common stats methods as in mathematical type stuff

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:22.140
you would use? So one of the things I know that some people getting into programming think is you've

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.860
got to be really good at math to be a programmer. I think you've got to be really good at logical

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:33.020
thinking, but you need to almost zero math be like a web developer. You know, we're talking percents

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:40.060
for CSS, incrementing numbers from one to two to two to three for IDs and stuff like that. But for

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:45.100
data science, maybe there's a little bit more like, where do you see that kind of background?

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:49.500
I like what you said, you have to think logically, but maybe the math isn't as important. And I think

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:54.380
it's actually somewhat similar in data science. I will say you probably need a little bit more math

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:59.340
than a web developer, but I think it's a lot less than most people think. And it's probably less

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.540
about being able to do the math and maybe more about understanding the mathematical concepts.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:10.300
And what I mean by that is a lot of, a lot of, so I also have a master's degree in data analytics.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.660
A lot of master's degrees in data science and data analytics will say you need calculus and linear

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.980
algebra as kind of a background for your math. And that kind of stops people. I don't want to do any

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.540
calculus. I don't want to do any linear algebra. And while both those concepts do exist in data

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:30.300
science principles, the majority of the time, the computer, Python is doing the math. You just have

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:36.460
to be able to interpret the results of the math and kind of know what different directions, like this is

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:40.860
going down, an optimization problem, you know, okay, that's the derivative, you know, getting closer to

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:46.380
zero. Like it's really less about knowing how to do the math by hand and more just understanding what the

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.460
math the computer is actually doing. So I think it's actually a lot easier than most people say.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:55.500
That being said, knowing how to do a derivative or taking integral, those concepts, I think is

00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:00.860
probably underlying pretty important. But other than that, like a lot of the times I'm doing linear

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:06.780
regression because it's, it's awesome. It gets the job done. A lot of the time I'm doing hypothesis

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:12.700
testing and statistics, which you have to look like at a P score, nothing all that crazy. At Exxon,

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:17.660
I had to do a lot of linear programming, but that's honestly, that's like the exception versus the rule.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.300
There's not a whole lot of linear programming for most data science, most data scientists. So

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:27.180
I really don't think the math is, is all that hard. Now, of course, that's coming from someone who

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:32.780
got a chemical engineering degree, who had to take all the calculus, all the linear algebra. So I did go

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.660
through those courses. I haven't really done it from scratch from like a lot of my students are teachers,

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.820
for example, who never took those courses in college. So I can't speak from that perspective,

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.740
but a lot of my students are able to figure it out at the end of the day and transfer. So it happens.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:50.460
Yeah, yeah, for sure. I think there, you make a good point. I think it's about knowing,

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:56.780
okay, this formula or this algorithm or this test means this thing. It applies in this situation.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.860
It doesn't apply in that situation. Here's what you're trying to get from it, right? Like,

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:06.620
I know I need to do a fast Fourier transform. So, and this is what it tells me when I get out the other

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:14.540
side. But do I need to be able to sit down and recreate the integral and the calculus behind it

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.940
and do that on like a home, like as a homework example, like, give me a function and I'll do the

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.900
Fourier transform and I'll actually do the symbolic integration. Like, no, you probably don't need that,

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:29.580
right? But you need to know, I do the Fourier transform in this situation and this is why. And then I just say,

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:35.020
call the function, do it, right? And interpret the results. Really, that's what being a data

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:40.060
scientist is all about is, yeah, what does the business use case, what's the desired business

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:45.980
use case? How do I relate that use case to the data? What technique can I use to get the outcome

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:52.540
that I need? Computer, go do it. Interpret results, present to stakeholders. That's a data scientist,

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:57.500
right? I think one of the challenges with that is going to be, not that it's not good, but I think

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:04.700
it's going to be challenging because how do you learn when to use a certain statistical test or when to do

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:10.780
some kind of funky transformation, like a Fourier transform without more traditional mathematical

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.940
backgrounds? And all the academics will not just go, oh, we're just going to give you like

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:19.340
five minute overview and they'll help you understand. They're like, nope, we're going to start with this

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:24.620
axiom or this theorem from differential equations. I'm going to work up. You're like, no, no, no, no,

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:30.140
no, I don't need that. I don't, I'm not on a four-year plan. I'm on a four-week plan. How do I,

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:36.620
how do I get value from a couple of the mathematical things without being sucked into like, yeah, now I'm in

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.820
differential equations at Harvard online and I don't understand how I got there.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:45.180
It's such a big problem and I'm so glad you brought this up and I'll be vulnerable because yeah, I felt

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:49.580
the same, the same way. And I was like, there has to be a better way. And so about, what was it? Three

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:53.260
years ago now, two and a half years ago, three years ago, I said, oh my gosh, I'm going to solve this

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:58.220
problem and I'm going to start my own data science bootcamp. And so I spent about six months making the

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.500
curriculum, making all the videos. I opened it up. I got some students in there and I ran it for about

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.620
six months and I looked at the results and man, we weren't getting anyone into data science jobs.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.940
And I thought, ah, what the heck am I doing wrong? I had this brilliant idea of like, we're going to be

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:19.820
less theory, more project, more hands-on. And I realized, man, the truth is people just learn better

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:24.220
at work. That's where you learn that whole technique that you just like, how does someone learn that?

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:28.860
The answer is by getting experience and learning it at work. And when I looked back and I said, okay,

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:33.500
well, we have had students get jobs. What jobs did they get? And it turns out most of them were

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:38.460
getting like business intelligence, intelligence engineer jobs or data analysts or financial

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:43.660
analyst jobs that were a little bit below a data scientist job. And I realized, oh man,

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:49.020
if we can just help people go from zero to one and get their foot in the door, they can go from one to

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:54.940
five much quicker at work because work is just, I don't know, it's this magical place, right? Like,

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:58.940
like you said, they, whatever you were working at earlier, and they're like, hey, can you do this

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.100
Kubernetes thing? They just kind of throw you in the fire and you're like, figure it out. And that's

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.180
somehow you do, I don't know what it is about work, but you figure it out and that's where you learn.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.100
So that's kind of what I've, why I changed my curriculum to be more focused on, you know, okay,

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.340
maybe people aren't going to become data scientists, but can we get them to zero to one quickly?

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:19.740
And then they can get paid to learn the rest of the data science stuff when they're actually in that

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:23.740
first position. How much do you know about what you actually want to do in the industry

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:28.860
before you've done it as well? Right? Like, you're like, oh, I thought everybody said machine

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:34.700
learning was awesome. And I've used chat CPT and I loved it, but it turns out actually like API is

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:39.900
better, but I've never had a chance to build an API. So until I started, I didn't even learn that one,

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:45.100
it was a thing to that. It was cool or vice versa, right? Whatever. But until you get kind of in,

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:50.700
you don't even know, like, actually this part is where I really am enjoying it. And so just getting that

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.500
first step, that's a big deal. A hundred percent. You don't know what you don't know until you know

00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:00.780
it. That's why, I mean, really when it comes to, if we like, we go back to just SQL or just Python,

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:06.860
you could spend, I tell people this, if you tried to master Python before you applied to a job,

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:12.140
you'd be like 80 years old before you ever applied to a job. Same with SQL, same with machine learning.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:17.180
The cool thing about data is we're never going to know it all. And so just learn the bare minimum to get

00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:21.900
your foot in the door. And then you have this place where you're going to get paid to learn what

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:26.460
you want to learn. Eventually, if you learn, oh, I love APIs. I promise you that there's a company out

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:31.100
there that will hire you and you can learn APIs on the job. Like that's going to happen. But that first

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:36.300
step is no true. There's a company out there that it doesn't know it needs APIs, but you could help them.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:40.300
And you know, they don't have huge expectations because this is the thing they just learned they needed.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.700
Right. A hundred percent. Yeah. It's wild, right?

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:50.220

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:18.220
data science project or notebook that I built. How do I share it with my users, stakeholders, teammates?

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:25.420
Do I need to learn FastAPI or Flask or maybe Vue or ReactJS? Hold on now. Those are cool technologies,

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:30.460
and I'm sure you'd benefit from them, but maybe stay focused on the data project. Let Posit Connect handle

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.740
Posit for supporting Talk Python.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.060
Posit Connect: Let's talk about some career advice. I mean, I know you talked about being

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:23.180
connected on LinkedIn pretty well and certainly having some kind of social network is important. And they

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:29.100
maybe, it's not that you would call it not social, but a real world network of actual human beings that

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.700
you're, you know, physically know somehow. Posit Connect: What's that? I don't know what that is.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.180
Posit Connect: I know. Like, we gave that up back in 2020, I thought.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.380
Posit Connect: Yeah. Posit Connect: Anyway, like, there was some stat that I saw somewhere that,

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:44.860
you know, over half of the jobs are filled filled before even becomes a job posting, right? Maybe

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.340
some of the best ones is like, hey, who knows somebody who can do this? We need some, like your

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:54.300
data science example, data scientist example. They quit like, oh, we need somebody. Does anybody know

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:58.860
good data science? I don't want to just go put it out on the open job market and have to have a hundred

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.820
interviews and who knows what I'm going to get. Like, if you can recommend somebody, let's start there,

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.580
right? So being in that group to be recommended, it's important.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.220
Posit Connect: It's the key. There was a really interesting survey done on LinkedIn and they said,

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.860
it was kind of, it was done by the same person and Jordan Nelson, by the way, he said, "How do you

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:22.860
approach getting a job?" And then the next day he said, "How did you get your last job?" And 80% of

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.740
people, they use what I call the spray and pray method, which basically means you go and you apply to as

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:32.540
many jobs as you possibly can and hope for the best. Cross your fingers. That was 80% of what

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:38.140
people were doing. And then on the next poll, the next day, it was a total, I think of what, 70% were

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:43.740
either headhunted, recruited or referred. And so it's like the Pareto principle here where, you know,

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:50.060
80% of the effort is only getting you 20% of the results. And really 20% of the effort gets 80% of the

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:55.100
results. So it's okay. We know networking and getting recruited is really important, but how do we do it?

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.580
It's easier said than done. And like you said- In the industry, how do I make friends who are,

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.700
right? It's like, well, my neighbors don't do it. So I guess I'm out.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:06.700
That's the tricky thing is, is yeah, if you're not in the industry yet, how do you get recruited

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:11.660
into it or how do you know someone? And what I've come to learn is it actually doesn't even matter.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:16.060
So like, for instance, let's take, let's take your neighbor, right? Your neighbor is probably not a data

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:20.540
scientist. Maybe you're lucky and they are, and they can refer you to a company. But what's really cool is

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.540
I've learned that companies really come to trust their employees and their employees'

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:30.860
recommendations. And so even if your neighbor, let's say is a web developer, or maybe even less

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:35.260
technical, let's just say your recruiter is in finance, right? And if there's an opening,

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:39.980
like a data science opening at that company, a lot of the times they will actually take their

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:44.780
employee referrals much more seriously than any sort of cold application that they get.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:49.500
And so a lot of the times I've had students who just know someone that works at the company,

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.420
they saw a job opening pop up. They're quickly, they message their friends. Hey,

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.260
do you know a recruiter or a hiring manager? I could talk more about this role. Could you do

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.740
an internal referral for me? And they were able to land jobs that they probably wouldn't have.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:06.860
No, they definitely wouldn't have without that internal referral. So it is tricky. It's the old

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.940
cliche. It's not, it's not what you know, it's who you know.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.860
I think there's still plenty of ways, COVID notwithstanding. I think that these days,

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:18.140
there's plenty of ways to get those connections, right? But maybe people don't know, like meetup.com

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:25.580
is really good. If you live in a non-tiny city, there's many, many things going on that around data

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:31.020
science, around Python, around other data engineering, whatever, right? You could go to those things.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:37.580
They're typically even free. Often they are free with food. They even feed you, right? And make connections,

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:42.940
or regional conferences or national conferences, right? Like we probably, many people have heard

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:48.780
of PyCon, right? There's US PyCon, there's EuroPython, and then there's, but that's, those are the ones

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:54.540
that are often talked about, but there's 10, 20 little smaller regional ones in the US and many more that

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:59.100
I'm not aware of throughout the world. Probably one of those within driving distance, right? That you could

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:05.020
go to make connections and just also kind of take the temperature of actually what, what you see on the

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:10.460
internet versus what you see and actually talking to real people. So I'd also say, just get out there.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:17.100
A hundred percent. Those places have the people who probably want to hire you because they're local,

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:21.580
right? Which is one thing that's, that's trouble on LinkedIn. I'm, I'm big on networking on LinkedIn,

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:26.380
but a lot of the times you're going to be networking with people who in all likelihood might never have a

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:30.300
role that's even open to you. But the people that you're like, for instance, we have,

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:36.620
I'm in Utah and we have Silicon Slopes that has like a tech meetup. We have a local Python

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:41.740
meetup chapter. We have the big data and developers conference that that's free every year with tons

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:47.260
of food. And the people who go there are people from companies around there that have the openings

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.740
that you're trying to find. And they want to hire people like you who are in the area. So at least

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.900
you can maybe come to the office once a week or maybe once a month or whatever. Right. And so really,

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.380
like you said, going to those meetups, it's tough because networking is always difficult,

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:05.260
either online or in person, but at least in those situations, you know, Hey, these are people that

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:10.380
are tied to real companies that exist around me that do make data higher. So I have a chance.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.980
Definitely a much higher chance than just shooting out a resume. All right. Well, let's see.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:20.700
We talked about job hunting already. What about like applications and resumes? What are your thoughts on

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:26.220
that? I think once again, with the applications, the more targeted that you can make it, the better,

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:32.620
right? So if you can really hone in on, I really want this job, I'm going to cold message five people

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:37.340
at this company and see if I can get that internal referral one way or another, make a real connection

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:42.780
with them. I think that's really key. And then with resumes, resumes are more of an art than they are a

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:49.260
science. I feel like they are so difficult to figure out. And these ATSs that are trying to match you

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:53.260
and see if you're a good fit. I've tried a lot of them and a lot of them suck. Whoever's the data

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:57.580
scientist behind those, we need to have a conversation with them because it's, it's a little tricky

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:02.060
sometimes. But one of the coolest concepts I've been introduced to recently, and I have a whole

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:10.380
episode on my podcast about it is A, B testing your resume. And basically the idea is a resume's job

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:15.820
is just to get you a screener interview or like a beginner interview, basically. Right. That's all an

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.500
interview. Like no one's seeing a resume and then hiring you. They're always going to interview.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:25.180
So if you think about it, a resume's job, the only job it has is to convince someone to get on the phone

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:29.820
and talk to you. And it's just a piece of paper. And guess what? You can put whatever you want on

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:35.340
that piece of paper. Now I'm not saying to lie, but I'm just saying you could theoretically make a

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:39.580
perfect resume for whatever job you're trying to go for and send it out there and see what happens.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.820
Right. But I'm not saying to do that. I'm not saying to lie. My point in saying this is that the resume

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:48.940
is just to get you the interview. And if you're not getting interviews, something's probably wrong

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:54.460
with your resume. And so, you know, tweak something, apply to 10 more jobs, see what happens. Tweak

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:59.980
something, apply 10 more jobs, see what happens. Until you finally have the right combination, skills

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:04.940
of experiences of different keywords. Because a lot of the time you're just trying to beat the ATS. And

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:10.140
that's the sad part about it is it's like, how do I prove to this random computer algorithm that they should

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:14.620
talk to me on the phone? That's a hard game to beat. And there's a whole bunch of advice

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:18.620
from all these different people. What I've come to learn is it's different for every company. It's

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:22.700
different for every person. You kind of kind of a numbers game till you get lucky and you figure it

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:28.540
out. That's good advice. I guess two thoughts. One is I know that speaking specifically to anyone,

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:34.860
one. But in general, women wait until they match all the requirements of a position where a guy's like,

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:41.500
I know three of those things. I'm taking a flyer. I'm sending it. I would just like to encourage the

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:47.180
women out there to just send it as well. I 100% agree with that. And I think if you reach 60% of

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.460
the requirements, I think you have a chance. Like it's a lot of the times those are wish lists and not

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:58.380
actual requirements. And depending on, are you local to the area? Do you have a domain experience

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:02.860
in this company? Like there's lots of other factors. What about contributing to open source

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:08.300
or having GitHub repos that can be like projects that you can show off or what's your advice there?

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:13.980
I'm a huge proponent of projects in the portfolio. I think if you don't have experience with something,

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:18.940
you create your own by building a project. And if you can do that with open source,

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:23.900
I think you should totally do that because I've benefited so much from open source. I have not

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:29.900
given back as much as I should to open source development and projects. I definitely should do that.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.980
But if you can find a project that you're passionate about that you can help with, I think you should

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:38.940
totally do that. Even if it's not open source and you're just building a project to showcase your skills,

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:43.660
I'm all about that. I think you can do projects that are super fun, maybe that are good for your

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:48.700
community or good for your life. I'm a huge fan of personal projects. I've put a Fitbit on

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:54.460
my dog before and looked at her steps. I've found the healthiest meal at McDonald's. I've looked at,

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:59.740
like visualized my weight over time and tried to create like different, like forecasting models and

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:03.660
stuff like that. There's so much data in our lives that you can use to make really cool projects.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:08.460
Oh, absolutely. You talked about, okay, you get your first job and that's where you kind of really

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:14.300
learn. But if you don't have your first job, you can effectively simulate that. Say, I would have gone

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:18.780
on to a job and been given a project to analyze something. I'm just interested in this thing. I've got

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:24.060
two hours a day until I get a job that I can be inspired about this and just get going on it. Maybe

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:29.980
create a website and publish your results and it can draw more people in to actually see that, right?

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:34.060
And start to appreciate it. They could even ask like, all right, who's behind this cool project?

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:39.340
Maybe I want them to come work for me. Little did they know you're doing all this work because you got

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:43.580
some spare time and you're trying to build up your experience and a self-guided study, right?

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:49.020
Yeah. If you can build a cool project and flip the job hunt where you're not applying for jobs, but jobs

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:54.460
start to apply for you, you're in such a good position and doing really cool projects can help you get there.

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:59.260
Now it's hard to do cool projects. It's hard to publish projects, which is one of the things

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:04.300
that people really struggle with. For all you Python listeners out there, let me just tell you,

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:12.620
Streamlit is absolutely amazing because it makes the deployment process so easy. It's free. It's a

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:17.900
little tricky to deploy at first, but compared to what you used to have to do it back in the day,

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:23.020
I'm saying back in the day, like four years ago, basically. But it was really hard to deploy

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:27.020
something where you could send someone a URL. Hey, check out my web application, machine learning

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:33.500
application. Streamlit is such a cool app that makes it so easy and so intuitive to make these

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:38.460
cool little apps that you could just put on your resume, put on your portfolio, send to recruiters. I'm

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.300
such a fan of the Streamlit app. I love it.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.540
Yeah, it's super cool. There's a couple of those and Streamlit is definitely one of the really nice

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:51.740
ones there. There's also some hosting behind Streamlit as well these days, right? You don't even

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.540
have to set up a server or anything and just create it and put it up there.

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:59.980
That's what I'm saying. Back in the day, I used Dash a lot and I'm still a big fan of Dash. Dash

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:06.380
is more customizable than Streamlit and can do quite a bit more, but it's a lot more work to deploy it.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.660
It's more like programming.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.740
Yeah, it is more programming.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.460
Programming the UI rather than just the behind the scenes.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:12.700
Yeah.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:18.300
You have to do both and you have to know a little bit about systems and data engineering and stuff

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:22.380
like that versus Streamlit kind of takes that, abstracts that away. But yeah, back in the day,

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:27.420
I used to make Dash web applications and deploy them on Heroku back when they had a free tier of

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:32.540
hosting and they've taken that away. So I don't even know what the go-to free hosting platform is

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:35.980
nowadays. I just, I moved most of my things to Streamlit and it's so nice.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.620
Yeah. We got Shiny for Python now, which is also nice.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.220
I haven't checked that out. How is it?

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:45.100
I haven't done too much with it either, but Joe and the team over there are doing pretty cool stuff,

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:50.860
like adding more dynamic interactive stuff to Jupyter, like running inside Jupyter and things. Yeah,

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:51.260
pretty cool.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.220
I'll have to check it out.

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:56.060
I think they also do a bunch of hosting stuff over there as well, is why it came to mind.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.140
What other advice you got for folks out there?

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:05.100
So AI is AI, not studying AI or learning to use AI, machine learning, but is there a benefit of trying

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:12.540
to use ChatGPT to help you get this job or is there a danger? I'm thinking, for example, have ChatGPT

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:18.460
write me an awesome resume and then the tools are like, well, we've detected this is AI generated and

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.340
it's out. You know what I mean? What do you see happening there?

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:29.260
A lot of people see AI as like an all or nothing tool as in it's either you, the human doing the

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.820
work or it's the AI doing the work. But whenever, I don't know about you, but whenever I'm using

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:40.300
ChatGPT for anything, it's very rare it's copy and paste for me or at least not iterative where I'm

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:45.420
doing multiple prompts, prompt after prompt after prompt, trying to tweak it exactly what I want.

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:50.300
And so the way I look at ChatGPT and other gen AI that will be coming out, that's only inevitable,

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:55.180
is instead of looking at does this replace me? Does this, like for instance, am I going to build

00:48:55.180 --> 00:49:02.060
my whole resume using ChatGPT? Can ChatGPT build, you know, take a data scientist's job and build the

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:07.180
whole model for them? I like to see it more as like a hammer. It's like a tool for the data scientist or

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:13.340
a tool for the job searcher to use in conjunction with your screwdriver or anything else. It's like

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:18.380
something to be wielded by a human, not replaced for the human, if that makes sense.

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:22.780
You know, it's really good for stuff like, hey, I know a regular expression will do this.

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:23.260
Yeah.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:27.740
The last time I studied, I completely forgot what this is about. And I know it's gnarly,

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:32.700
but if I just ask, here's an example, here's what I want. Boom. And traditionally what you would end up

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.020
doing is you'd be on Stack Overflow. Yeah.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:38.860
You'd be all over the internet. You'd be trying to piece it together from external information anyway.

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:44.220
And so code is something that's a little bit more in the wheelhouse of the generative AI,

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:50.220
because it can't really make it up as much. I know it could like do something insecure and you didn't

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:55.340
know it was or whatever, but it's not like asking for legal advice where it makes up cases that didn't

00:49:55.340 --> 00:50:00.460
exist. Like it gives you code. You put it in the runtime of the compiler and it runs or it doesn't.

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.740
And the output comes like you did.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:02.700
Yeah. It works or not.

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:08.620
Yeah. So it's pretty, pretty effective for that. But yeah, for resumes, I would be more like,

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:14.620
let me ask it. What are the in demand things? And if I know these three skills, what other skills should

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:20.140
I know to get a, you could sort of use it in an explorative way to then come up with what you

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.140
might write for yourself, right? Something like this.

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:27.900
I find it really useful for brainstorming like action verbs on your resume bullets. Like I think

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:33.180
it's really good at that. What's 10 different ways to say lead. So I don't say lead five times on my

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:38.700
resume and I use some different action bullets. I think it's great at that. I personally, it's pretty

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:44.380
rare that I start any Python code from scratch nowadays. I'm either starting hopefully from a

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:49.740
template that I've already written, or I'm starting from a ChatGPT. Like this is what I kind of want

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:55.260
to accomplish, right? Like the outline for it. Like one of the things I hate doing is I make a lot of

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:59.260
streamlet apps. I probably make a streamlet app a month right now. And I hate starting from scratch

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:03.260
with streamlet. It's super easy to start from scratch, but I'll say, Hey, ChatGPT, I want to

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.860
build a streamlet app. This is like the component I want here. This is the component I want here.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:12.300
This is the component I want here. And it's almost like a warmup for me as a programmer. And it will

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:18.060
create something that works. It's not what I want. And I spend the next five hours trying to make it

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:23.740
what I want, you know, without ChatGPT, but it kind of gives me a warm start to my programming process.

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:29.100
So I really like it. I think it's something that everyone should use. And I think if you're thinking

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:34.540
about getting into any sort of programming, you know, whether it's data science or web development,

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:40.940
I think you should be a little bit less worried about it taking your job and job security. I think

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:45.820
you should almost be more excited that, wow, the bar has never been lowered to break into tech.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:51.900
Like this is a step up gift from the programming gods that I get to use to break into tech.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:56.620
Another thing to keep in mind is I imagine a lot of people listening to this podcast are not just

00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:03.820
starting a college program, right? They're coming from possibly other experiences, other specialties.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:07.980
You know, what's really good for job security, knowing the intersection of two things, the

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:13.900
intersection of chemistry and programming, the intersection of geology and programming for Exxon,

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:19.900
potentially, right? Like those things take you from a pool of a thousand to a pool of tens,

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:24.540
tens, right? And so what's awesome about that is it means two things. You don't throw away,

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:28.140
if you got a degree in something else like biology or whatever, you don't throw away like,

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:33.660
well, that was wasted four years. That's out. And it slices the pool of people who could apply for

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.140
certain jobs way, way smaller, right? Sounds like you agree.

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:41.180
Oh, a thousand percent. I'll just tell a quick little anecdote. When I was at ExxonMobil,

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:45.820
there's a lot of things I did not like at ExxonMobil, but this is something I really liked. It's about

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:51.980
once a quarter, they would do a crowdsourced data science competition for the whole organization,

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:56.060
like around the entire world. And they would say, this is a business problem we're trying to solve,

00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:00.460
you know, and at Exxon, we have data scientists all over the world and like all sorts of different

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:05.100
teams and things like that. So I like did not know all the data scientists at Exxon. And they'd say,

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:10.860
this is the problem we're facing. Here's the data go, right? And I loved participating in these. It was

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:15.180
like right up my, my wheelhouse of like, I really enjoy exploration and all this stuff.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.700
At the time I was getting my master's degree, but I didn't have my master's degree.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:24.220
And I was competing against, so I'm just a chemical engineering grad, right? And I'm competing against

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:29.660
people with PhDs in computer science and in data science and all these like people who have way

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:35.260
more experience than me. And I actually won a few of these competitions. Thank you. I appreciate it.

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:40.220
And it's not because I was a better programmer or a better data scientist. It's because I majored in

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:46.460
chemical engineering and I knew the business problem, the domain extremely well. And I kind

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:51.180
of knew the programming and the data science stuff, but the combination of them made me very valuable.

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:56.860
Like one of the best examples I have is we're looking at crude oil properties. And I remember

00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:01.100
like there was a forum where you'd like ask your questions. And one of the, one of the data scientists

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:06.620
asked, Hey, is sulfur bad? There's lots of sulfur in this. Is it bad? And like to a chemical engineer,

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:11.420
that's like the most obvious thing. No, you, yes. Sulfur is very bad in crude oil. That's very,

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:17.260
no, no, that's like such a fundamental thing to me and to him or her. That was like groundbreaking.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:20.700
And so, yeah, your domain can become your superpower in your career.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:26.940
Yeah. And it makes it way harder for ChatGPT and other types of tools to just automate you out of a

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:31.500
job because you bring in all these skills together, which is awesome. But it also makes it easier for

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:35.500
you to get the job. It makes it easier for you to continue your momentum of whatever you've been up

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:39.660
to. It's just, it's good all around. Yeah. I think it's more fun too, because once again,

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:45.180
like when I was trying to decide if I should study computer science, I was like, man, I don't really want to

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:52.460
to build an Excel workbook for building an Excel workbook sake. That's still true for me today.

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:57.260
I don't want to do data science for data science sake. I only like machine learning or data science

00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:01.580
when I'm doing it to solve a really fun problem I'm passionate about. That's where it's more fun.

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:05.900
So if you can be excited about the domain and excited about the algorithms, I think that's a

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:09.660
great place to be. Absolutely agree. All right. We're getting short on time,

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:14.380
but maybe tell us a bit about your data career jumpstart. You've referred to it a couple of times.

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:18.780
Yeah. I have a company called data career jumpstart. I just try to do a lot of education. So the

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:23.180
education happens on LinkedIn happens on YouTube. And I actually forgot to mention this at the

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:28.540
beginning, but I have my own podcast called the data career podcast, where I help people land their

00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:33.980
first data job. We're about at a hundred episodes. So not quite the groundwork that you've put in.

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.260
That's still a ton. That's awesome.

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:40.940
Yeah, we're getting there. And then, yeah, I also have a bootcamp where I try to affordably help

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:46.700
people land their first data analyst position by teaching them the skills, the networking and the

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:50.140
project and portfolio building that they need to do something.

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:51.740
Like the long version of this show.

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:56.220
Yeah. Basically. Well, yeah. Just take what we talked about today, expand on it,

00:55:56.220 --> 00:56:00.620
make it like 350 unique lessons. And that's exactly what it is.

00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:06.860
Yeah. Very cool. All right. Well, we're about out of time. So maybe just every final call to action,

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:11.660
people maybe are inspired. I see Dave go out in the audience. That's an awesome talk. Very much so.

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:15.420
What's next. It's easy to be inspired, but you got to take action.

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:21.260
Yeah. I love that. I think it's always fun to listen to podcasts, but you probably benefit way

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:26.460
more from the action you take after a podcast. So for you guys who are maybe interested in a data

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:32.140
analytics or a data science career, explore that. If you're like, yes, I'm in, make a plan, make a

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:36.860
roadmap. If you need help, I have a webinar that will help you make a roadmap. What skills should you

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.620
learn? How should you be networking and stuff like that? But really probably if you're just getting

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:44.220
started trying to figure out what skills you should learn, like what are the top skills that you should

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:48.620
be learning and then learning those skills and then not only learning those skills, but take action and

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:52.540
learning and build some sort of a project that we talked about that you could put on a portfolio,

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:57.260
make a streamlet app or something like that. That's probably the best action you could possibly take.

00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:02.380
If you need any ideas, advice, feel free to check out my website, datacareerjumpstar.com or the

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:07.020
podcast data career podcast. Hopefully there's a lots of free resources for you guys to check that out.

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.580
If you've never seen streamlet before, I have some YouTube videos about

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:13.660
streamlet that you guys can check out, but I love it. Just take action somehow, do something.

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:18.540
That's one of the huge, huge differentiators is like, you might be inspired, but you just got

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:23.260
to start taking those steps and it becomes a snowball. So thanks for sharing all your experience and your

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:28.380
advice. Hopefully some people out there are taking action and yeah, I'll put everything we talked about

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.620
in the show notes, of course. So thanks for being here, Avery.

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:32.380
Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:33.180
You bet. Bye all.
