00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Python is used for a wide variety of software projects.


00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.280
One area that's really gained a lot of momentum


00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.720
is in the computational space, including data science.


00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.240
On this episode, we welcome back Allen Downey


00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.500
to dive into a particular slice of this space,


00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.180
simulation problems in Python and physics


00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.920
and engineering in general.


00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.240
This is "Talk Python to Me,"


00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.240
episode 423, recorded June 6th, 2023.


00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.060
(upbeat music)


00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:40.300
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python.


00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.160

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.240
Hey, Alan.


00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.320
Welcome to Talk Python, I mean, welcome back.


00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.320
Thank you.


00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.320
It's a pleasure to be here.


00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.320
Pleasure to have you back.


00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.440
talking just a little bit before the show,


00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.280
realizing it's only been six years


00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.540
since you were on the podcast.


00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.380
How about that?


00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.840
Last time we talked about Python and engineering


00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.300
way back in 2017, which was a lot of fun


00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.260
and has some interesting lead-ins


00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.600
to some of the things that are actually created now.


00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.280
You were hinting, "I'm working on this project


00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.560
"about simulating things with Python."


00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560
Here we are talking about it.


00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.700
- Yeah, I was just getting started then


00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.360
and the book has come out very recently.


00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.080
So we've kind of bookended the project.


00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.840
>> Absolutely. Well, it's quite a project and it's a very interesting one.


00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.120
I think a lot of people out there,


00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.620
they hear maybe they should use Python instead of MATLAB or


00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.200
some other language for modeling their domain.


00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.520
With your book that you put together,


00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.140
which is available for purchase or you can read it online for free, that works for you.


00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.240
It has a bunch of different examples.


00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.840
How many examples? Maybe 30 or so?


00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.120
>> I think that's right.


00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.280
There are examples in the chapter and then case studies that get into more detail.


00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.960
Yeah, so there's a lot of different areas of specialization


00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.920
where you're bringing Python to answer problems.


00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.320
And we're going to have a lot of fun talking about that.


00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.560
But, you know, let's just do a quick catch up.


00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.880
It's been six years since we last spoke.


00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.520
What have you been up to?


00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.000
Well, I've changed jobs a couple of times.


00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.080
I was a professor at Olin College for 19 years.


00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.120
I left at the end of last May.


00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.800
And then I was at Driven Data for a little while,


00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.000
working on data competitions and machine learning.


00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.760
And then recently I've joined Brilliant,


00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.520
where I'm doing curriculum design.


00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.200
- That sounds very fun.


00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.920
First of all, leaving college, you were at for 19 years.


00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.800
That's a big deal.


00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.560
- Yeah, I've been an academic


00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.040
pretty much all the way through.


00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.160
I graduated from college, I went to grad school,


00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.480
I had my first job.


00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.360
I was a faculty member at Colby College


00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.960
and then Wellesley College.


00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.000
And then, as I said, I've been at Olin for 19 years.


00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.840
So it's a real change of career.


00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.280
How's it going?


00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.240
It's good. I'm learning a ton.


00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.400
You just, you know, whenever you start something new,


00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.160
you're always, you're on this, you know,


00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.000
the steep part of the learning curve,


00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.720
which is challenging, but it's also just exciting.


00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.360
You're getting exposed to different things, learning a ton.


00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.160
Yeah, absolutely.


00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.280
And working at Brilliant now, you know, Brilliant's a good company.


00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.480
There's, they've been past sponsor of the show, which is great.


00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.960
And, you know, maybe just talk a bit about how you think about curriculum and design,


00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.680
since that's what you're focused on there. How do you think about putting together small class,


00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.600
not semester wide classes for people to learn? Yeah, that's a big part of it. It's a different


00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.600
format. It's smaller, as you said, it's interactive, in the sense that the learner


00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.400
is interacting with these new graphical elements and other ways of communicating ideas visually.


00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.960
We use a lot of animation, and the text is deliberately very concise.


00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.420
We're trying to show, not tell.


00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.560
And that's a really different kind of curriculum design for me.


00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.960
I'm used to, you know, I have a semester-long course.


00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.960
I've got several hours a week.


00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.960
It's very different.


00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.800
And that's part of the challenge that was appealing to me,


00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.160
because I saw some of the courses and I was very impressed with the pedagogy


00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.960
and the opportunities that you have there with animation


00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.360
and sound and interactives.


00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.960
It's a very different kind of teaching.


00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.760
But it's not--


00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.440
Yeah.


00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.520
There's no-- I don't have any interaction with students.


00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.880
So that's a challenge as well.


00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.800
It's a big challenge.


00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.480
I went from teaching in person to teaching online as well.


00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.720
Not too brilliant.


00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.720
But I think there's a couple of really big differences.


00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.920
One is when you're either--


00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.520
you have a student for a semester Monday, Wednesday,


00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.280
Friday at 11 to 12, or if you're doing a week-long training


00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.920
class in person, those groups are captive, right?


00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.040
And so the constant need to keep their attention


00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.840
for every single minute is really different, right?


00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.920
Because it's not impossible, but it's rare that students


00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.440
just get up and walk out because there's a five minute


00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.840
section they weren't engaged with,


00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.480
but they could easily leave a website.


00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.840
- Yeah, it's particularly in a format like Brilliant,


00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.080
there's not a certificate at the end.


00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.720
The motivation to keep going is you're having a good time


00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.880
and you're intrinsically interested in the topic.


00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.880
So from my point of view as an instructor,


00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.120
the challenge there is to maintain that.


00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.520
It has to be interesting, engaging all the time.


00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.000
As you said, if you've got a five minute lull,


00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.400
you might lose your audience.


00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.800
- Yeah, the other part that is a big difference


00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.680
is when you have those folks in class,


00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.840
even in a Zoom meeting to a degree,


00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.120
you get immediate feedback of how does an idea land?


00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.400
If I present it this way, are they engaged?


00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.620
or they clearly not getting it.


00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.980
Whereas you put it out into the world


00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.260
at Brilliant or TalkByThon or wherever,


00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.560
and they've got to, you take a guess


00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.440
and you put it out there, right?


00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.440
You don't get that feedback.


00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.940
- Yeah, that's definitely challenging.


00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.320
We do have some signals where we can see


00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.220
if a learner is getting stuck in a particular place


00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.220
or if we see a lot of drop off on a particular lesson,


00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.700
we can go in and try to figure out what's happening.


00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.400
We get a little bit of explicit feedback.


00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.040
Sometimes the learners will tell us what's wrong.


00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.860
but most of the time, you're kind of,


00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.080
it's on you to make sure that that lesson works.


00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.300
And your colleagues were constantly reviewing


00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.320
each other's lessons and looking for those places


00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.160
where we think we might lose learners.


00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.360
- Excellent, well, I'm sure it's a lot of fun.


00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.920
Some nice comments in the live chat out here,


00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.380
people appreciating that as well.


00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.920
So one thing that you said you learned,


00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.200
which I haven't really learned before,


00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.120
is I don't even really know what it looks like,


00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.080
is Elm, tell us about Elm, what is this?


00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.480
This is a programming language, as it says, it's primarily for web applications.


00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.480
It is a functional programming language, and it's mostly a stateless computational model.


00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.240
So it's very different from Python.


00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.700
I've just been learning it.


00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.760
This is what we use for a lot of the interactive elements.


00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.120
And it was new to me.


00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.520
I had honestly, I had not even heard of it.


00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.160
But it's been great.


00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.720
I just, you know, it's been a little while since I learned a new language.


00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.440
It's been about 23 years since I learned a new language.


00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.160
And I've done functional programming, but I haven't used it, you know, really for applications.


00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.240
So this has been, you know, challenging, but fun.


00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.360
It looks a little bit like Lisp meets HTML.


00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.360
That's not bad.


00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.360
Yeah.


00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360
Okay.


00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.360
Certainly the semantics is very Lisp-like.


00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.760
Syntax can be, although not too many parentheses.


00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.480
Not as many.


00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.200
You get that blister on your pinky or whatever finger you use for the phrase.


00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.940
- Maybe you're right, index figure.


00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.960
- Right. - Or ring figure.


00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.420
- Yeah, and then the syntax,


00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.480
it has a couple of nice features like pipes.


00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.740
So, you know, taking a value


00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.600
and piping it through a sequence of functions.


00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.240
And of course, you know, functional features


00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.680
like passing around functions as first class objects


00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.280
and partial function evaluation.


00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.300
- Is this a front end language like a JavaScript


00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.360
or is it a back end language more like Python?


00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.280
- Yeah, no front end, it's getting compiled into JavaScript.


00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.660
But it is strongly typed, like extremely strongly typed.


00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.460
like integer and float are incompatible types.


00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.300
So--


00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.540
- There we go.


00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.900
- So very strongly typed,


00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.380
but that along with a lot of error checking


00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.660
gives you some more confidence


00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.180
that if you put this on a webpage


00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.080
and a large number of people interact with it,


00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.780
there are maybe fewer errors that can get past a compiler.


00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.460
You know, a really dynamically typed language like Python,


00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.180
you're rolling the dice, you deploy that code.


00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.660
You know, some of those lines of code have never run.


00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.940
and the first time they do, you might be in trouble.


00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.500
- The type hints are helping.


00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.820
mypy is helping, but that's not a runtime thing.


00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.500
Pydantic, for example, is a runtime version,


00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.380
that option that helps a lot.


00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.060
Before we move off this front end stuff,


00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.260
then we'll get to the modeling.


00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.980
Have you been tracking PyScript


00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.060
and the front end Python stuff?


00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.940
Is that interesting to you?


00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.020
- It definitely is,


00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.060
and especially from a teaching point of view,


00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.780
getting people into Python,


00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.620
one of the challenges from way back has always been,


00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.900
How do you get a new programmer to the point of executing


00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.220
their first line of code?


00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.260
That is definitely not as big a barrier as it used to be.


00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.020
It used to be, you had to install things


00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.140
and download things and all that.


00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.580
But yeah, the lower that barrier, the better.


00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.920
And yeah, I think PyScript is one of the things


00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.860
that can help to lower it.


00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.700
- Yeah, I do too.


00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.060
I'm very excited about PyScript.


00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.780
It had been interesting in the realm of kind of


00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.900
different ways to execute notebook style code and so on


00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.940
when it was based on Pyodide.


00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.540
And now that they're talking about moving to MicroPython,


00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.220
it starts to get into the realm of it.


00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.420
It could download the same size as Vue or Angular almost.


00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.640
And then it becomes,


00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.140
maybe you can make real apps with this thing.


00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.980
So I'm looking forward to see where that goes.


00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.820
- Oh, interesting.


00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.020
I had not heard about that.


00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.980
So that's exciting.


00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.820
- Yeah, yeah.


00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.600
One of the big things that they're trying out,


00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.940
I had a couple of the folks on from various projects


00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.140
four or five months ago,


00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.180
is they're trying to,


00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.900
instead of using full CPython as the foundation


00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.500
to use MicroPython, which means the download


00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.420
goes from like 10 megs to 100K.


00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.260
- Yeah.


00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.100
- And you're talking 100K downloads,


00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.020
you're like, you know, that's kind of like a big JavaScript


00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.820
and if it's over a CDN and it's cached,


00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.860
you know, maybe you could just make that part of your app


00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.900
in general, not as a specialized thing.


00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.980
- Yeah, that's interesting, particularly because


00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.880
I think one of the other challenges for Python right now


00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.180
is it takes a while before you're doing


00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.780
really interesting stuff.


00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.020
And JavaScript, for example, you can immediately start


00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.860
doing front end kinds of interactions


00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.860
and a beginner can start to write programs


00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.500
where it resembles the kind of apps that they're using.


00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.580
And I think that's a pretty important hook.


00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.300
For Python, that's a long path.


00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.140
And so it sounds like this could shorten


00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.060
that path quite a bit.


00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.060
- It sure could, that would be very interesting.


00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.340
I think your insight there comes in


00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.340
as a bit of a teacher as well, right?


00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.620
Like it's one thing as an engineer,


00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.740
Like I'm gonna build this thing,


00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.680
so I'm gonna choose this language for such and such.


00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.140
But as a teacher, you realize like,


00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.700
if you don't have a win early enough in the learning cycle,


00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.020
then you might just bail.


00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.640
And for a lot of people, a win is I have a UI.


00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.500
I have a thing that looks like an app


00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.900
that I could see on my phone,


00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.380
or I could see in my web browser or something like that.


00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.700
- Yeah, definitely.


00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.940
Or a robot or some interaction with the real world.


00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.340
But yeah, converting Fahrenheit to Celsius


00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.180
(laughs)


00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.580
is not gonna do it.


00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.600
- No, but Celsius to Fahrenheit, that one is the one.


00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.440
That's the one, no.


00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.280
- Please forget it.


00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.520
- But speaking of converting numbers and so on.


00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.080
This portion of Talk Python to Me


00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.980
is brought to you by Influx Data,


00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.020
the makers of InfluxDB.


00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.780
InfluxDB is a database purpose-built


00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.960
for handling time series data at a massive scale


00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.780
for real-time analytics.


00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.160
Developers can ingest, store, and analyze


00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.920
all types of time series data, metrics, events,


00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.120
and traces in a single platform.


00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.220
So dear listener, let me ask you a question.


00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.780
How would boundless cardinality


00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.220
and lightning fast SQL queries impact the way


00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.720
that you develop real-time applications?


00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.860
InfluxDB processes large time series data sets


00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.980
and provides low latency SQL queries,


00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.980
making it the go-to choice


00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.260
for developers building real-time applications


00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
and seeking crucial insights.


00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.740
For developer efficiency,


00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.340
InfluxDB helps you create IoT, analytics,


00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.220
and cloud applications using timestamped data


00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.240
rapidly and at scale.


00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.800
It's designed to ingest billions of data points


00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.720
in real time with unlimited cardinality.


00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.880
InfluxDB streamlines building once


00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.940
and deploying across various products and environments


00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.240
from the edge, on-premise, and to the cloud.


00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.100
Try it for free at talkpython.fm/influxdb.


00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.960
The link is in your podcast player show notes.


00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.400
Thanks to InfluxData for supporting the show.


00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.360
Let's talk about your latest book.


00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.920
You have a lot of books over at Green Tea Press.


00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.840
This is your home for where your books go, right?


00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.680
- Yeah.


00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.600
- As well as links to other ones you've written


00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.880
at places like O'Reilly.


00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.720
- Right, yeah.


00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.280
So everything starts here and there's a free version


00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.400
of all of the books and you can get to it from here.


00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.760
You can see kind of the evolution of my process


00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.720
'cause some of the earlier books,


00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.240
some of them look better than others.


00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.520
Let's put it that way.


00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.280
And then links there for the ones that have been published,


00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.120
There are hard copies available and electronic versions


00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.200
in convenient formats.


00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.360
- I think we might have spoken about this six years ago,


00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.200
but it was six years ago and I'm not sure,


00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.680
and I imagine a lot of people don't remember it.


00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.840
Did we talk about your textbook manifesto?


00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.680
What is this?


00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.620
- That was what really got me started.


00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.200
And it came from my frustration


00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.880
with existing programming books,


00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.120
but also just textbooks in general.


00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.860
The way they're used in a lot of classes,


00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.800
they are expensive, they are way too big.


00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.480
you know, if there are 700 pages or 1000 pages,


00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.200
nobody's gonna read that in a semester.


00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.040
And if you're assigning 50 pages a day,


00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.100
I think, you know, you're kidding yourself


00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.560
and the students are not getting much out of that.


00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.200
So this is the idea that you can write a book


00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.920
that your students can read and understand


00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.640
and that is at the size where you can do


00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.440
something like a flipped classroom,


00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.860
where they are actually gonna do some reading


00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.220
before class, not 50 pages, but 10 maybe.


00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.300
Come to class.


00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.340
Now, as an instructor, I can help to figure out,


00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.420
what are the problem spots?


00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.940
What should we cover in class?


00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.700
What can we do to practice those ideas in class


00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.140
to take advantage of the time


00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.380
when we're actually in a room together?


00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.380
So, read when you're on your own, come to class,


00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.320
let's do things that are more useful


00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.660
than me standing at the front of the room talking to you.


00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.900
- Yeah, sure.


00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.500
Okay, that makes a lot of sense.


00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.140
So let's dive into your book,


00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.340
modeling and simulation in Python.


00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.940
Now, as I'm going through this,


00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.280
I'm not sure what I would classify it as.


00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.380
Is this a science book?


00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.620
Is this an engineering book?


00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.820
Is it a programming book?


00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.260
It kind of feels like it's a little bit of all of those.


00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.180
How would you, what's your elevator pitch here?


00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.260
- Yeah, it's that.


00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.140
It is the solution to a chicken and egg problem,


00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.580
which is that in an engineering curriculum,


00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.540
a science curriculum, and maybe even more broadly,


00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.380
I think for teaching physics and math to almost anyone,


00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.580
a computational approach is really appealing.


00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.140
There are things that you can do with computation


00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.040
that are very difficult to do analytically.


00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.340
You can do more interesting things faster.


00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.600
So that's the appeal.


00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.000
The hard part is most people are not coming into college


00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.440
with programming experience.


00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.040
Some do, most don't.


00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.040
So whatever your curriculum is,


00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.400
but let me focus on engineering


00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.660
because that's where I was.


00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.600
You've got a cohort coming in who have programmed,


00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.600
a cohort who have never programmed,


00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.000
and then kind of maybe a middle,


00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.500
maybe they've done like HTML or something like that.


00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.400
And now I want to teach them physical modeling,


00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.600
but I have to do kind of three things at the same time.


00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.040
The modeling piece, the physical models,


00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.400
the domain knowledge, you know,


00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.360
if it's a scientific system or an engineering system,


00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.240
whatever it is, and programming.


00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.240
And there's no good sequence.


00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.740
Like, I can't send people out to take a computer science class,


00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.240
and then they come back and we do computational science.


00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.200
It just, there are a number of reasons that that doesn't work.


00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.280
And same thing, if they go, let's say they go take calculus or linear algebra,


00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.900
and then they come back, collecting that knowledge and then trying to synthesize it is really hard.


00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:27.700
And it means it's a sequence of courses instead of starting in right from the beginning.


00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.360
So those are some of the problems that we were working with.


00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.360
And the best solution, at least we think, is put it all together.


00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.600
We're going to teach people how to program


00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.800
using these physical models as examples.


00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.600
And so they're getting some mathematics, not a ton,


00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.800
kind of a gentle introduction to differential equations,


00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.560
some physics, but it's a bit more broad


00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.260
because it's not just mechanics,


00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.960
and then some programming,


00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.260
but it's really a subset of programming


00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.060
that's focused on those domains.


00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.460
So that was my best explanation.


00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.460
>> Oh, it's good. It's good.


00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.540
I can see how there's not a real great solution for that in a college curriculum.


00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.580
You send them off to take a CS class and they might come back of having done


00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.700
a introduction to programming course but still not really be able to do too much,


00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.220
or an algorithms course and like,


00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.380
I can really tell you about a doubly linked list.


00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.580
You're like, "All right, you're still not ready. I'm sorry."


00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.940
It's a challenge to bring these things together.


00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.140
I think that's generally a challenge in education a lot,


00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.660
us to cross these things over and why a lot of people feel like certain things


00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.300
are that's useless. I'll never use that. That doesn't have any value to me


00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.140
because it's taught in such an abstract, isolated silo.


00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.780
Yeah. And you never close the loop because we're making a promise. If, if,


00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:49.420
if we send a student to take a prerequisite class, the contract is you


00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.220
go do this thing. And then when you come back, we're going to make it pay off.


00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.300
You're going to see the benefit and we never do.


00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.060
It's tough, it's tough.


00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.980
So like we said, there's about 30 different problems in here


00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.940
like population growth,


00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.220
how long does it take for your coffee to cool?


00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.980
What's the optimal way to transfer it to work?


00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.900
Glucose, disease modeling, as well as vaccines.


00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.740
People can check out.


00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.440
So I thought it might be fun for us to just pick out


00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.020
however many we get through.


00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.660
Let's say we take a shot at 10, we'll see if we get there.


00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.820
10 of these and just kind of talk through


00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.660
what is the problem?


00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.100
What are some of the Python ideas at play here?


00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.060
or maybe what are some of the math or science ideas as well?


00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.860
So you wanna start with world population?


00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.840
- Sure, yeah, this one was interesting for me.


00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.900
It's something I didn't know very much about.


00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.220
So I got to learn.


00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.240
I think it's a sweet spot of,


00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.640
you don't need a lot of computational tools


00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.660
'cause this one comes very early in the book.


00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.260
But you can study a real system that's happening right now


00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.300
and get to understand it.


00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.220
So it's a discrete system.


00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.340
So we're just counting the number of people


00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.580
and modeling population growth.


00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.200
And so the number of new people in any year


00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.340
is gonna be some function of the current population.


00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.880
And so we can introduce a couple of different models,


00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.460
you know, starting very simple.


00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.500
One of them says,


00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.820
what if we have the same number of births


00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.540
and deaths every year?


00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.220
Well, okay, the population would grow linearly


00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.520
or maybe shrink linearly,


00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.100
but it would be linear growth, constant slope.


00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.180
All right, what if it's proportional?


00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.340
What if we have a birth rate that's, you know,


00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.580
proportional to the current population.


00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.820
Some people might know you're gonna get exponential growth.


00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.060
And I think if you ask people what's going on


00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.420
in the world right now,


00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.140
they probably believe that we are experiencing


00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.260
exponential growth.


00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.540
- That was my thought when I read this.


00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.380
I thought, oh yeah, okay,


00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.740
so we're probably talking about geometric growth


00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.900
and those types of things, yeah.


00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.300
- Right, well, that's the model.


00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.420
And we try to fit that model to the data and it doesn't.


00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.800
And so that's where the first lesson comes from,


00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.680
which is you can do all the theory you want


00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.040
and eventually you will collide with data.


00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.880
And your theory may or may not survive the impact.


00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.400
And that's what happened here is,


00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.760
the population is currently not growing exponentially.


00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.840
Going back to about 1960, it's pretty close to linear.


00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.840
And that one's kind of weird because,


00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.560
okay, wait a minute, if it's linear,


00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.480
that means we have roughly the same number


00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.040
of births and deaths every year, but how?


00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.520
How do you get 7 billion people


00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.480
to coordinate and make that happen?


00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.240
So there are a couple of ways to think about what's happening.


00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.800
One of them is the logistic growth model,


00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.800
which starts out exponential,


00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.680
and then as you approach a carrying capacity,


00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.120
you approach this limit,


00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.880
it approaches that limit asymptotically at the high end.


00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.840
And in the middle, there's a piece that looks linear.


00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.280
So you could look at that model and you could,


00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.040
okay, maybe that's what's going on,


00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.920
except it turns out that's not quite right either.


00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.160
And that's where the domain knowledge comes in.


00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.200
'Cause so far, it's just been programming


00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.460
and looking at data.


00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.620
At some point, you have to talk to a demographer


00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.800
because they actually know what's going on.


00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.400
And what's going on turns out to be very interesting.


00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.380
It's the demographic transition.


00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.520
And this is a social and economic phenomenon,


00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.760
which is as societies, countries


00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.240
become more economically developed


00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.120
and have more personal freedom,


00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.940
fertility rates tend to go down.


00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.040
And they very often, it's often dramatic.


00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.380
It would be a shift from lifetime fertility


00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.140
of five, six, seven, or eight children


00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.040
down to very close to two.


00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.280
And 2.1 is the replacement level


00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.960
where population levels off.


00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.080
A lot of developed countries right now


00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.380
are at or below replacement in terms of birth rate.


00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.000
And so the populations are leveling off


00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.320
or starting to decline.


00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.120
- Yeah, there's gonna be some knock-on economic effects.


00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.080
Although I don't know that those were modeled in your book,


00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.120
but you know, like how does things like social security


00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.720
and support nets happen when the thing being supported


00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.480
is heavier or larger than the people doing the supporting,


00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.320
right?


00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.160
- Right.


00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.560
- Speaking of economies like Japan, for example, and so on.


00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.720
- Yes, yeah, they've been below replacement level


00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.600
for quite a while.


00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.560
So in some sense, they are the predictor


00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.760
of what a lot of other countries are looking like now.


00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.440
And as you said, you know, vast economic consequences.


00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.800
Now, that's where I stopped.


00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.040
It's not an economics book.


00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.880
(laughing)


00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.720
- Yep.


00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.920
- That's where it was, I think, fun for us to, you know,


00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.900
get to that point and say, look, okay,


00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.900
we have found some interesting things,


00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.980
and now, you know, go explore,


00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.380
'cause there's a lot more,


00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.620
lot more to learn about this.


00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.540
- Yeah.


00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.460
I doubt it would surprise the listeners


00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.100
that the standard data science pieces are at play here.


00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.020
Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib,


00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.340
those kinds of things, right?


00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.140
- Yeah, there it is.


00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.960
From Pandas, read HTML.


00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.660
Yes, whenever we can, we try to get real data.


00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.940
One of the goals of this class


00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.380
is to connect students to the real world,


00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.540
and that's one of the places


00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.940
where data science is a real opportunity


00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.460
because the availability of data is great


00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.460
and the computational tools for working with data


00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.300
are very good.


00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.220
Now, obviously in Python,


00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.180
Pandas is one of the popular libraries for data.


00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.180
There are others, more generally,


00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.180
there's R, Matlab.


00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.900
This is a real, I think, teaching opportunity.


00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.500
- One of the things I thought was interesting


00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.380
from a lot of these was the acquisition


00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.060
of the starter data for a lot of these.


00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.860
So for example, on this one, you have,


00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.940
you're getting the world population estimates from a table.


00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.660
And I think this table originally comes from Wikipedia,


00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.660
but you've saved it locally because you're smart.


00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.660
And in case they change the format of that page,


00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.100
you don't have to rewrite your book.


00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.620
But you know, it really highlights certain things


00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.900
that are just so easy if you know the way,


00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.980
but are not necessarily obvious.


00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.020
So for example, here you have from pandas import HTML,


00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.520
you can just go read HTML and you give it a,


00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.680
either a URL or just a HTML file in this case.


00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.360
And then you can say, well, we just want the second table


00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.720
that was in that HTML.


00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.360
And it literally grabs out of Wikipedia,


00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.280
it grabs the table and turns it into a Pandas data frame,


00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.400
which is pretty remarkable, honestly.


00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.280
- Yeah, well, I have mixed feelings about this


00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.260
'cause it's great that we can get the data


00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.860
and it's easy with these tools.


00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.000
It's a little bit sketchy in the sense that,


00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.920
as you said, we have to,


00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.360
What if Wikipedia changes the format?


00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.360
This is not exactly data that anybody intended to export.


00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.720
So I think I would prefer to get this data


00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.900
from the original source in a format


00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.520
that was really intended.


00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.320
An HTML table is not exactly a data transport format.


00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.240
- No, an Elm table.


00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.440
No, just kidding.


00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.120
I mean, it's fragile in a lot of ways.


00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.600
Somebody could insert a column, delete a column,


00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.160
more likely than insert one, right?


00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.760
To add, oh, we found a new data source.


00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.760
we added it and all of a sudden all of your stuff breaks.


00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.320
But it could even be as simple as


00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.080
we added more information to the Wikipedia page


00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.080
and now there's a table that precedes this table in HTML.


00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.840
So when you say, get me the second table,


00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.680
you actually get some unrelated thing, right?


00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.760
So obviously, I mean, it's effectively web scraping


00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.600
behind the scenes, which is always fraught with instability.


00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.680
- But you're taking advantage of what Wikipedia did,


00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.440
which is to collate all of these sources.


00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.280
People have gathered this and curated


00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.460
this collection of data.


00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.820
So that's why I say mixed feelings,


00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.220
'cause it is a great opportunity to take advantage of that,


00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.740
but web scraping might not be the best way to do it.


00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.580
- Yeah, quick question from Marwan.


00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.020
Does the book include attempts to visualize the simulations


00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.380
like modeling a bouncing ball becomes more rewarding


00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.340
if you can see it in action?


00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.080
- Definitely, and that comes up in the third part


00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.420
of the book, which is about mechanical systems.


00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.940
And those are the things where, yeah,


00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.060
we've got objects moving in space


00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.780
and that begs to be an animation.


00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.880
There's not a ton of it, because it's a little...


00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.380
The tools for animation in Jupyter Notebooks


00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.580
using Matplotlib are a little bit clumsy,


00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.740
so I didn't get deep into it.


00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.200
But definitely the point where you get to see the simulation


00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.540
and you see the objects moving in space,


00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.460
you, I think, appreciate it, for one thing.


00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.140
You also, I think, get to debug it,


00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.980
because your eye is really good at seeing physical errors.


00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.140
If your physical model is doing something incorrect,


00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.900
it's gonna, you're gonna see it instantly.


00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.820
It's gonna bother you.


00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.460
- Yeah, that does look right.


00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.860
And you know, it's probably not necessarily a problem


00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.460
with the animation, with the modeling,


00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.060
but even things like acceleration and deceleration.


00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.500
If a thing just goes over and stops,


00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.340
you're like, oh, it didn't.


00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.740
That's not right, it shouldn't do that.


00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.900
It should slow down and come to a stop.


00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.500
It didn't hit an imaginary wall.


00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:37.080

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:41.000
All right, next one to talk about is epidemiology. And in this one, we talk about the freshman


00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.960
plague. People maybe with regard to college have heard of the freshman 15, like a certain amount


00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.560
amount of weight a lot of people seem to put on from the stress of going to college.


00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:54.800
But the freshman plague is more about coming together in a big group from all


00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.960
over the place more than maybe people are used to coming from their hometown.


00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.520
Yeah.


00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.640
Well, we started this example.


00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.520
Well, let's see.


00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:08.440
I think we were working on this in 2017, but we were using this example previously.


00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.560
So before COVID is the point.


00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.400
And I guess at the time it was sort of a fun example.


00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.180
like, "Hey, everybody gets a cold


00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.380
"during the first few weeks of the semester, ha ha."


00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.440
And it's less funny now,


00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.820
but it's also definitely more relevant.


00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.900
We're thinking about modeling an epidemic


00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.420
and modeling interventions,


00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.740
and in particular, understanding a concept


00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.080
like herd immunity.


00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.500
So if you're talking about public health


00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.620
and what's our civic obligation,


00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.340
it's not just looking after yourself.


00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.720
there is a public consequence to your individual decisions.


00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.080
- Yeah, absolutely, there sure is.


00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.660
And yeah, this used to be somewhat of an interesting example


00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:55.660
and then it became one of the biggest stories,


00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.060
maybe of our lifetimes, who knows.


00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.640
Anyway, so this is the Kermack-McKendrick model.


00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.480
And there's a couple of interesting things


00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.740
that I thought were interesting models here.


00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.040
So in this model, you have the susceptible folks


00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.600
who are not yet infected, but potentially could be.


00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.840
You have the recovered people,


00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.560
and you assume they have some kind of immunity,


00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.720
at least for their freshman year, I guess.


00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.340
And then the people who are infected.


00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.040
And you talk about this idea of having,


00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.880
what's it called, stock?


00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.220
Yeah, stock and flow diagrams.


00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.720
Those are pretty interesting,


00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.680
'cause you think of the freshman class


00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.520
as kind of a fixed set, right?


00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.280
- There are some different versions of the model.


00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.000
And right, Cormac McKendry, nobody calls it that.


00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.500
Everybody just calls it an SIR model,


00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.340
'cause those are your three.


00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.480
- SIR, okay. - And you can extend it.


00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.140
There are additional groups.


00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.180
And what you're modeling is the flow of,


00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.880
in this case, it's people, from one stock to another.


00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.820
So someone who is susceptible, if they become infected,


00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.600
they move into the infectious stock,


00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.420
and when they recover, they move into the recovered.


00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.120
So this is the simplest model,


00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.900
and usually it's a fixed population.


00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:13.420
The reason that this is where we start is that this lends itself to a differential equation


00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.060
that we can do some work with.


00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:19.560
We can't solve it analytically, but there are some useful analytic methods.


00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.140
And we can also work with it computationally.


00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.280
So this is one of several examples in the book where we do both.


00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:31.860
And that gives us a chance to show the strengths and weaknesses of analysis and computation,


00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:37.060
and also to do some validation by comparing the results from one and the other.


00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.060
So yeah, that's why this is where it is in the book.


00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:46.980
It's kind of the transition from the discrete systems in part one to the first order continuous


00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:47.980
systems.


00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:48.980
Yeah.


00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.980
Okay.


00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.140
One of the things that, I don't know, maybe I should have just known this or not, but


00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:57.940
was interesting to me was thinking about applying differential equations to a discrete set,


00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.940
right?


00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.700
- I think of differential equations


00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.580
of being either applied to like maybe an interval,


00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.940
all of the real numbers or the complex numbers,


00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:10.120
or, but not to 90 things, you know?


00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.340
Which that was surprising, I thought.


00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.300
And then your ability to model that in Python


00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.140
was pretty cool.


00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.340
- Yeah, so I'm glad you mentioned that


00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.740
because it's a really useful modeling method


00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.660
and it's a good example of the kind of modeling decisions


00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.100
that you're making all the time.


00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.740
And it can go in both directions.


00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.780
You can take something that you know is actually discrete,


00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.020
like people, and treat it as if it were continuous.


00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.640
And that works pretty well if you have a large population.


00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.820
Obviously, if you get down to very small numbers of people,


00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.100
it starts to break down.


00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.740
And that's where we can have a conversation about modeling


00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.260
and say, look, this is an approximation, right?


00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.340
This isn't how the world really is,


00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.760
but I can pretend I can run the model


00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.860
and those results can be useful


00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.900
even if the model isn't perfectly realistic.


00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.660
'Cause that's how models work.


00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.280
None of them are perfectly realistic.


00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.780
So that's, I think one of the goals of the book


00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.980
is to engage the learner in those kinds of discussions


00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.700
about modeling decisions.


00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:15.000
'Cause I think that's missing in a lot of science classes.


00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.860
If you think about the traditional freshman physics class,


00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.940
you are told what the model is.


00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.680
So we're gonna do a block on a frictionless plane.


00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.780
We're gonna do a projectile moving in a vacuum.


00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.140
Well, the frictionless, that's a modeling decision.


00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:32.140
It says we're going to temporarily ignore friction


00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.780
in order to solve this problem.


00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.780
But you as the learner didn't get to make that decision.


00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.020
You're not required to figure out the consequences of it


00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:43.220
or think about when it doesn't apply.


00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.940
And that's what we really wanted to get at here.


00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.740
- Yeah, that's a really interesting point.


00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.820
And that's why a lot of people think


00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.980
math is just a bunch of formulas


00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.660
or science, hard sciences are often


00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:55.780
just a bunch of formulas.


00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.880
then you just got to remember to use the formula


00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.880
because it just goes from this sterilized version,


00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.140
final version, without understanding,


00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.680
going from observation to making your way through it


00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.380
till you end up with something like this, right?


00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.020
- Yeah, yeah.


00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.720
Now there's a scary version of this,


00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.220
which is that it's not objective.


00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.020
'Cause if there's one answer


00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.980
and your job is to figure out what's the right formula,


00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.220
apply the formula, get the answer at the back of the book,


00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.340
That's nice and objective.


00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.140
And, you know, we want our science to be objective,


00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.540
but regardless of what we want, it isn't.


00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.660
'Cause it's based on modeling decisions.


00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:38.000
All science is based on modeling decisions.


00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.140
And those are subjective decisions.


00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.060
It's deciding whether a particular model


00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.180
is suitable for purpose.


00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.940
Depends on what you're trying to do.


00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.020
If you want to make a general,


00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.340
qualitative description of a system,


00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.980
maybe you can use a simple model.


00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.700
maybe you can leave friction out of it.


00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:59.180
If you want to land an orbiter on Mars,


00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:03.300
or a rover on Mars, you might need a more detailed model.


00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:08.500
- Yeah, if you're off by 1% of one degree,


00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.140
it's gonna matter by the time you get there.


00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.140
- Yep.


00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.260
- Where's that plane in again?


00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.620
Yeah, so in this one, you talk through using this,


00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.100
a couple of types and ideas in here,


00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:21.340
with states and systems, and it sounds like in the book,


00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.180
it looks like in the book,


00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.020
you provided some foundational building blocks


00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.020
for modeling the mod-sim module, right?


00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.340
So in addition to just having the books,


00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.820
you've got a bunch of Jupyter notebooks


00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.060
that people can check out,


00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:38.340
and as well as some code to kind of help this modeling here.


00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.380
You want to talk a bit about that?


00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.220
- Sure.


00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:44.180
So this was my attempt to use some programming ideas


00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:48.420
to communicate modeling ideas by creating these objects.


00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.020
So one of them is a state object,


00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.060
and it represents the state of a system.


00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.940
So if you think about an object moving through space,


00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.020
it has position and velocity.


00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.060
And at any point in time,


00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.040
if I write down the position and velocity,


00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.500
that's the state of that object.


00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.700
So in object-oriented programming,


00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.420
that begs to be an object.


00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:12.900
It is a state object that contains position and velocity.


00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.660
Now, under the hood, it is a panda's series


00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:20.140
that is mapping from names to values.


00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.800
Similarly with a system object,


00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.520
that's actually a Python namespace.


00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.120
So there are a couple of different things,


00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.920
but this one's a namespace.


00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.920
And it represents everything that you need to know


00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.600
about a system in order to model it.


00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.740
So it'll be the parameters of the system.


00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.060
If it's, let's take that projectile moving in space again,


00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.720
it might be mass, cross-sectional area,


00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.120
coefficient of drag, density of air,


00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.800
temperature of air, all the things to model.


00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.680
One of the examples is like a baseball in flight.


00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.520
- Excellent.


00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.920
you go through, you model, you run the simulation over time


00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.880
and eventually end up with a graph that shows, you know,


00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.360
a little over half of the students got lucky


00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.560
and didn't get the plague,


00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.080
but about half of them did at some point


00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.760
throughout the year or the semester, whatever it was.


00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.160
- So that's, you can do a single run


00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.560
in order to simulate a hypothetical course of the disease.


00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.520
And now you can start to vary the parameters and say,


00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.080
you know, what if the disease is more infectious?


00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.640
What if the recovery time is longer or shorter?


00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.360
What if people start washing their hands?


00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.280
And what if we start vaccinating them?


00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.520
And so by varying the parameters now,


00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.240
you can see how the output of the model


00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.000
depends on the system parameters.


00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.640
And that's where another one of these objects comes in.


00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.040
We have a thing that's called a sweep series.


00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.560
It's a mapping from a hypothetical parameter


00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.000
to the output of the model using that parameter.


00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.320
- Yeah, when you hear people talking about COVID,


00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.120
I remember them talking about the infection rate,


00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.800
Is it bigger than one?


00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.040
Is it less than one?


00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.200
All of those things were very relevant here.


00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.800
>> Right. Yes. The R0 and R, the contact rate.


00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.500
That term comes straight out of this model.


00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.600
That is the ratio of the two parameters here.


00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.920
Beta is the rate of infection,


00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.280
depending on how many people are


00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.360
susceptible and how many are infected.


00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.540
Gamma is the rate of recovery,


00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:20.820
which is the fraction of infected people who recover in a unit of time.


00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.060
And the ratio of those two things is the contact rate, the R0.


00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.900
Yep. All right. Well, way more relevant these days than it was a few years ago.


00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.220
Oh, yeah. We all know a lot more about epidemiology than we used to.


00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:40.340
We sure do. My daughter was just enjoying going back and watching some of her favorite YouTubers


00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:44.740
videos from February and March of 2020, just laughing.


00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.140
They were saying, "Oh, it looks like we're gonna have


00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.300
to stay home for a week."


00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.020
And she's just like, "They have no idea.


00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:49.860
They have no idea."


00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.860
- Yeah. - Okay.


00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.460
All right, let's go on to something more fun.


00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.940
One of my favorite things, coffee.


00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.300
- Come on.


00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.140
- Yeah, awesome.


00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.620
And so tell us about the coffee cooling problem


00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.500
that you solve here.


00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.340
- This one's a classic.


00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:06.500
The source that I'm aware of is a Martin Gardner column


00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.780
in Scientific American.


00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.260
And it posed this question,


00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:13.340
which is if I get my coffee and I also have some milk


00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.700
and I'm planning to add the milk to the coffee,


00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:19.180
should I add it now and so that they cool down together


00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.300
or should I drive to my destination?


00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.700
Let's suppose you're commuting.


00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.660
Should I get to my destination and then mix them


00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.600
with the goal of getting the coffee


00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.660
down to a pleasantly drinkable temperature


00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.860
as quickly as possible?


00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.580
- Okay, yeah, you pick it up,


00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.740
maybe hit one of those drive-thru coffee shack things


00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.060
that's just stands on its own.


00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.420
You know, it's always too hot here.


00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.980
And like, how should I do this so that I can basically


00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.500
have a perfect coffee when I arrive where I'm going, right?


00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.820
Okay, excellent.


00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:51.340
So this one involves Newton's law of cooling, right?


00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.180
Did I get that right?


00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.000
- You got it.


00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.060
- And the heat transfer, there we go.


00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.220
Newton's law of cooling.


00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.660
Another differential equation here,


00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.220
as they want to be in simulation.


00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.060
- Yes, right.


00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:01.940
So this is another one,


00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.540
which is a first order differential equation.


00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.640
You can do it two ways,


00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:09.440
which is you can break it up into discrete steps in time.


00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.400
And so your differential equation


00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.120
becomes a difference equation.


00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.020
And that's a natural thing for a programming language


00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.780
because now it's a loop.


00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.640
And during each time step,


00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.020
you figure out the difference


00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.980
between the coffee and the environment.


00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.860
That tells you the rate of change.


00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.720
And then that lets you make a prediction


00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.220
for the next time step.


00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.780
And so if you repeat that process,


00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.920
that is Euler's method for solving differential equations.


00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.240
So there's kind of a natural transition there.


00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.220
And then I think for this problem,


00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.040
we don't yet use the ODE solver,


00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.760
but then later in the book we do.


00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.160
And that's trying to motivate,


00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.900
why are we using this library?


00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.360
Well, there are limits to Euler's method.


00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.880
At some point, it's not very accurate.


00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.880
- Yeah, it might not be accurate enough for sure.


00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.360
And ODE, ordinary differential equations


00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.560
for people out there listening.


00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.560
- You got it right, thank you.


00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.020
- Yeah, it's a very differential equation.


00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.020
And so, you know, Python has, you know, SciPy,


00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.420
SciPy has several functions


00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.940
that will solve differential equations for you.


00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.500
And so we're kind of, we're sneaking up on that.


00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.420
- Yeah, okay.


00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.740
It is interesting that you can say,


00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.060
yeah, sure, it's a differential equation


00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:18.900
and those might sound scary and hard to solve


00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.580
and all those kinds of things,


00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.100
but you can subtract two numbers.


00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.420
You can do a simple thing and looping is good.


00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.980
And so if you just make your loop


00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.180
have small enough increments,


00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.700
you're kind of doing the same thing that, you know,


00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.140
taking the limit to get to calculus does anyway, right?


00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.980
- Yeah, we're kind of, we're short circuiting


00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.580
what I think is a really unnecessary loop,


00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.420
which is there's a lot of physical modeling


00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.220
where you take a system, you write a differential equation,


00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.060
but then you can't actually do anything


00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.820
with that differential equation.


00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:50.740
You can't solve it.


00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.740
And so you're going to have to use numerical methods anyway.


00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.860
And if you look at what the numerical method is doing,


00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.580
it's basically Euler's method.


00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.180
It's, you know, they're more complicated versions,


00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.060
but it's the same idea.


00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.020
We're gonna take time,


00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.460
we're gonna break it up into discrete steps,


00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.340
and we're basically simulating the system.


00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:13.140
So what we do in the book is cut out the middle,


00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.880
and go straight to simulation.


00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.220
There's almost no reason to write a differential equation


00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.420
if you can't solve it.


00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.740
You might as well just start with a simulation.


00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.580
- Yeah.


00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.740
So what's the story with the coffee?


00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.020
How should I approach this?


00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.420
- I'm not gonna give it away.


00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.940
(laughing)


00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:28.780
People got to earn it.


00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.220
They got to come figure it out, huh?


00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.700
You do have at the end.


00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.420
So one of the big challenges here is not like,


00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.400
how soon in my trip should I get the coffee?


00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.040
How long should I let it sit or any, those kinds of things.


00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.660
It's one of the important parts is you have milk or cream


00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.180
you want to put into the coffee.


00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.100
You should decide if you put it into the hot coffee,


00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.700
the cold cream right away, that starts it somewhere.


00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.340
Other than if you maybe wait till you get to the office


00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.620
and then mix the cream.


00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:57.100
So people can come back and solve that about the milk.


00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.600
Here's a question.


00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:03.780
This came up, one of the people I chat with on Twitter posed this question, it's a variation


00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.780
of this.


00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.980
He said he was disagreeing with his wife about using an electric kettle.


00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:15.900
The question is, let's say that you heat up a kettle full of water, you use half of it,


00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.420
and now the other half is there.


00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:22.740
You have a stay warm feature where you can set the kettle so that it keeps the water


00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.180
at let's say tea making temperature for you,


00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.980
or you can shut it off, let it cool down,


00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.980
and then later on when you want to make tea,


00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:31.860
heat it up again.


00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.500
Now, let's leave out of it for now


00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.340
that the time that it would take to heat up again.


00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.780
Let's say you don't care about that.


00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.840
You just want to know about energy consumption.


00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.700
Is it better to keep the water hot or let it cool down


00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.480
and then you have to use all that energy


00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.780
to heat it up again?


00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.340
Do you want to get in on this?


00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.860
- Yeah, yeah, my guess is it's better to let it cool down


00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.380
because the wider temperature gradient you keep


00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.620
between the ambient air and the water,


00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.940
the higher rate of loss of temperature,


00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:03.940
which you actually had a really interesting piece,


00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.100
tidbit of information here.


00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.180
You said, okay, if the coffee cools from, you know,


00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.780
cooking temperature down to drinking temperature,


00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:11.900
that's a ton of energy.


00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.580
It says to give you a sense,


00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.460
if you're able to harness all of that heat to do work,


00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.900
which you can't because of inefficiencies of engines,


00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.700
But if somehow you had a magic levitating engine


00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.020
that converted a heat energy to potential energy,


00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:29.000
you could use this lost energy to lift the cup of coffee


00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.620
from sea level to 8,500 meters


00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.580
just under the height of Mount Everest.


00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.140
That's an insane amount of energy when you think about it.


00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:40.100
- That is, and honestly, I did this calculation 10 times


00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.420
and I'm still not sure.


00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.740
- It's gotta be wrong.


00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.580
No, it's awesome, I love it.


00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.140
- I believe that this is true,


00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.340
but if someone contradicts me, I would be grateful


00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:51.940
because I just wanna know.


00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.740
But at least according to the calculation I did,


00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.900
the difference between mechanical energy and heat energy


00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.780
is just, it defies your intuition.


00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.660
And it's really, it's thermodynamics that is the difference


00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.520
because to take something from sea level


00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.500
up to the top of Mount Everest is organized energy


00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.980
and heat is disorganized energy.


00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.040
And what that means is you can have quite a lot of heat


00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.180
and not be able to do much work with it


00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.580
because it's disorganized.


00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:22.040
- Yeah, okay, excellent.


00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.580
Before we move off this one, I remember you were,


00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:25.420
I can't remember who I saw,


00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.320
I think it might've also been Scientific American,


00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.040
but there was a debate about coffee


00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.920
of whether blowing on it,


00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.880
if it was the cool air hitting the water,


00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.640
that would cool it, or if it was just the evaporation.


00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.120
And someone did an experiment where they put a fan on it


00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.480
with cool background air,


00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:45.000
and they put a hairdryer with hot air blowing on it,


00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
And it's still, it's the evaporation.


00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.300
It's like these state changes


00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.280
and this energy of this heat loss.


00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.520
It's pretty powerful.


00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.320
- Yeah, the latent heat of vaporization is a huge number,


00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.160
which is good 'cause that's what keeps us cool.


00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.280
That's why sweat works.


00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.640
- That's right, that's right, it's good.


00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.560
We're coming up on summer,


00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.240
so we're gonna appreciate that, I'm sure.


00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.320
All right, on to the next one.


00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.000
Limits to growth.


00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:06.840
Tell me about this one.


00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.760
- Yeah, so this is related to the population growth


00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.120
that we were talking about earlier.


00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.320
and this is developing the logistic growth model,


00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.640
but then trying to figure out,


00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.480
is that really what's going on?


00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.320
Is human population leveling off


00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.360
because we are hitting resource limits?


00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.000
Like, are we running out of food or other resources?


00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.800
The answer for now is no.


00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.280
I mean, we can certainly look at places in the world


00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.080
where resources are scarce,


00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.080
but that's not what's limiting growth.


00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.220
Interestingly, it's almost the opposite.


00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:42.480
It is the places that are most economically developed


00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.700
where resources are most available,


00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.060
where fertility rates are-- - That's a good point, yeah.


00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.460
- The fastest. - Okay.


00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:50.080
- And it's not being driven by death rate.


00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.100
That's the other thing.


00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.160
I think the other reason that we know


00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.740
that what we're seeing is not a resource limit


00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.140
because that would drive up the death rate.


00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.100
And that's not the case.


00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.040
The death rate is dropping at all ages in all places.


00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.500
Well, with a few exceptions.


00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.500
- Yeah, yeah, of course.


00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.740
So this one's kind of about finding that equilibrium.


00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:16.820
Yeah, this is taking the model to its limit and saying, okay, if we use the logistic model,


00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:21.340
even though we think physically, this isn't exactly what's happening, can we make a prediction


00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:27.060
about where we think world population will level off and possibly even start to fall?


00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:32.980
And one thing that surprised me is that even though this model is very simple and not realistic,


00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:38.760
The predictions that come out of it are not wildly different from what we're getting from


00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.300
real demographers.


00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:48.160
So the UN and the US Census both have projections for world population out to about 2100.


00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:54.800
And they predict world population will probably level off around 2100 at somewhere between


00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.280
nine and 11 billion people.


00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.440
And this very simple model is not too far off from that.


00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.840
That's a pretty wide range.


00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.040
(laughing)


00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.120
You know, a lot of things can happen.


00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:05.960
- Yeah, sure.


00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:10.040
A lot of assumptions and current equilibrium might change.


00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:10.880
Right?


00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.000
Like, for example, climate change.


00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:12.840
Who knows what that does?


00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.660
- Yep.


00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:14.860
That's big, but right now,


00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:19.860
the biggest drivers are the indices of world development.


00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.120
If you look at things like health


00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.960
and especially child mortality.


00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.880
When child mortality is low, fertility goes down.


00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.920
That's counterintuitive, but to some extent,


00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.740
people are having, let's say, enough children.


00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.220
If your children have a very high chance of survival,


00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.200
enough is a smaller number.


00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.460
It's a funny way of looking at it,


00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.580
but that's, so health, economic opportunity,


00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:48.420
human rights is one of the other big driving forces.


00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.260
- Right, autonomy.


00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.340
- Yeah, freedom to make reproductive decisions


00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.100
and education, that's the other big one.


00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.300
- Yep, yep, okay, another one from the health area,


00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.900
glucose and insulin.


00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:01.980
- Yeah, what's the problem we're solving here?


00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:05.940
- So this is a model of the system in our bodies,


00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.140
and actually I think all mammals, to regulate blood sugar.


00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:12.460
And it's the interaction of glucose or blood sugar


00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:15.540
and the hormones that cause blood sugar to go up and down,


00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.700
the primary one being insulin.


00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.980
And there's a model that's called the minimal model.


00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.580
And it was proposed by researchers


00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.580
who were trying to describe,


00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.980
you know, what's the minimum set of interactions


00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.260
that we need in order to have a model


00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.380
that fits the data pretty well.


00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.400
This is an example that I liked partly


00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.700
because the discussion of modeling was so explicit


00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:42.200
that there are some quotes from these papers


00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:46.340
where they are more open about their thinking than usual.


00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:49.020
It seems like people kind of hide the models.


00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.140
And these guys were really thinking about


00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:55.380
what do we need to include and what can we leave out


00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:58.700
And how do we evaluate whether the model is good enough?


00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:03.620
And the way they did good enough is they actually had data


00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.360
from studies of blood sugar and diabetes


00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:09.500
where people have a challenge test.


00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:13.220
They are actually injected with glucose solution,


00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:16.420
and then they monitor their insulin levels


00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:20.300
and blood sugar levels over three hours


00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.140
with measurements every two minutes.


00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.820
And so you can see blood sugar goes up


00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:28.300
and then insulin goes up, and then glucose comes down,


00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.000
and then insulin comes down,


00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.940
and then you eventually get back, if everything works,


00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.260
to your steady state base levels where you started.


00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.740
- I see, so if you don't have diabetes,


00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.020
your body should react that way,


00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.100
but maybe if you do, it can't produce the insulin


00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.420
to counterbalance that or something like this, right?


00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.660
So I think I've heard of that as a test


00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.500
for seeing if you have, either have diabetes


00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.660
or maybe are pre-diabetic, right?


00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:54.840
- Yep, exactly.


00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.680
And there are two things.


00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.960
You might not be producing enough insulin


00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:01.820
or your cells might be insensitive to it.


00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.760
So there are kind of two ways that that can go wrong.


00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.400
- Okay, so I think, I don't remember which one


00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.080
that you did this on here.


00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.720
There's all, all these come with great plots over time


00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.240
and you're running the simulation


00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.480
and seeing how it evolves over time


00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.880
and those kinds of things.


00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:21.040
But at least one of these you used SimPy, right?


00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:21.880
- Yes.


00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.440
- SimPy is pretty interesting.


00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.020
- Yeah, so this is symbolic computation,


00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:30.040
and it allows you to solve systems of equations,


00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.180
nonlinear equations, differential equations,


00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:35.980
at least for the ones that have an analytic solution,


00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:38.120
SymPy will often find it for you.


00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.740
And when I say find a solution,


00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.860
it's not a numerical approximation,


00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.380
it's a symbolic representation of the function.


00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.180
- Right, that's why I thought it was so interesting


00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.820
as a thing, 'cause so everything we've been talking about


00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.620
so far are like these Euler type solutions,


00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:54.620
you're like, okay, well, if we just approximate,


00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:57.380
if the gap is small enough, it's like calculus,


00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.500
but it's a loop, you know?


00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.520
Whereas this says, actually the integral


00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.620
of this differential equation is this other formula, right?


00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.060
Like you would learn in calculus or something.


00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.420
- Yeah, and so what you get is this object


00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.180
that represents the function,


00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:15.860
and you can render it as LaTeX,


00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.500
so you can kind of see it, you know,


00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.380
with the nice integral symbols


00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:21.580
and infinity symbols and all that.


00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:24.380
And you can also from that generate Python code.


00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:25.900
So you could have, you know,


00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:28.100
solve your differential equation


00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:32.540
and then evaluate the result as a numerical computation.


00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:35.380
- Right, the answer instead of being 3.14,


00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.480
whatever is just the letter pi.


00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.320
- Right.


00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.820
- Right, it's like, you gave me a formula,


00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:43.460
here's the actual symbolic solution to it as a number, right?


00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:44.300
- Yep.


00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.120
- Yeah, pretty cool.


00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:45.960
So you did, I believe you used that


00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.420
in some of your simulations or some of your models, right?


00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.540
- There were a couple of examples where we did both.


00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:57.100
we would do the numerical solver and then the symbolic computation


00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.600
and then compare them.


00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:02.300
And then a couple of places where there's an analysis that you can do,


00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:06.900
like the SIR model, where you could do the analysis by hand,


00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.400
and certainly in lots of science and math classes, that's what you would do.


00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.200
But I really wanted to show people how to do this symbolically,


00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:18.140
because I think it separates two parts of the activity.


00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:21.620
there's the low level activity of actually, you know, writing


00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.480
all the symbols on paper and being very careful not to leave


00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.460
off the minus signs and the two, factor two and all that. And


00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.800
then there's the high level, keeping track of what am I


00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.540
doing? What's my goal? What are the steps I'm following to get


00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:37.500
there? And I think symbolic computation has a lot of


00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:41.220
potential to separate those two, where I think people could come


00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:44.180
away with a much better understanding of that high


00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:50.580
level stuff if they are freed from so much of their attention being on the low level stuff.


00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:57.700
Yeah. Yeah. Just the grind of factoring polynomials or taking the derivative or whatever, right?


00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:02.900
Yep. Yep. You see, you know, mechanical systems, if you're working with physical vectors,


00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:08.340
you just, you have a page that's just full of sines and cosines. And it's, in some sense,


00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:15.060
what that is a failure of notation, because that page full of sines and cosines is really


00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:20.900
telling you that you have not represented the computation in an effective way. That the sines


00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:25.700
and cosines are a consequence of not using vector arithmetic.


00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:30.740
Right, which you do make a big use of with pandas and things like that, right?


00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:37.700
Right. We get to it, and this is, I think, where I started to reach the limits of the current tools,


00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:42.040
because ideally, if you have vector quantities,


00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.700
like position and velocity and acceleration,


00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.600
you should represent them as vectors.


00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.080
And so when you add two vectors,


00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:52.480
you're not converting them to their coordinates,


00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.580
adding the coordinates,


00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.840
and then putting the result back into a vector.


00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.520
You just think of vector addition


00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.720
as a fundamental operation.


00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.120
But in the same way, we would like to be able to


00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:07.200
do differentiation and numerical solution


00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.040
to these methods, also using vectors as primitive objects.


00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.580
And we're not quite there.


00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.700
The SciPy libraries don't really do that.


00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.380
So I end up doing a lot of packing and unpacking


00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:23.460
where I start with vectors, but then to do the computation,


00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.680
I have to break them down into coordinates.


00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.300
And then when I get the result,


00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.340
I have to stuff it back into vectors.


00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.600
I think the next generation of scientific computing,


00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:35.480
we need vectors as basic types,


00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.680
and we need computation with units.


00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:41.720
Yeah, right, which is something that's also often missing.


00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:44.020
To my knowledge, this does not exist in Python


00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:46.220
or any other programming language that's not,


00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:47.220
at least it is mainstream.


00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.880
There's probably some engineering ones,


00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.980
but we have things like Pint, right?


00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:51.480
Yeah.


00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.880
Which is a pretty neat library.


00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:56.880
It's very neat, and it's very close to what I want.


00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.580
Astropy is the other library I'm aware of


00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:02.220
that does a really good job with units.


00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:04.180
And I've played around with each of them


00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:11.280
enough to be excited for the potential, but also to have hit a wall of, "I still can't quite do what I want."


00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:17.680
Ideally, it should be end-to-end. I should be able to start with the parameters of my system


00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:24.680
and the initial state described using vectors with units, and then run the whole computation


00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:29.780
so that at the end, my result is in the form of vectors with units.


00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:30.620
- Yeah.


00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:31.440
(laughs)


00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.820
- And that's still, that's not easy yet.


00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:33.660
- Yeah, not yet.


00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:34.480
Okay.


00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.620
You know, the SymPy stuff is a little,


00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.420
a little like that in the sense that


00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:41.460
the thing you get back is like kind of a function


00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:42.620
in the mathematical sense,


00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:45.920
like f of x equals, you know, e to the x.


00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.860
And you can compose them and pass them around, right?


00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:51.260
And sort of use them a little bit more than just,


00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.340
well, I got an answer out of this


00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.100
and then I feed the answer there, right?


00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:54.940
Numerically.


00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:55.760
- Yes.


00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.780
So, SymPy is end to end in this way,


00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:01.580
that you start with symbols and you end with symbols.


00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.400
There's no like in between where you have to break it down


00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:07.980
into numerical methods and then build it up again.


00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:11.320
So yeah, I think SymPy has achieved this goal


00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.200
and we're still, I think, working on vectors and units


00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.720
and scientific computation.


00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.680
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.640
All right, well, we're pretty close to out of time,


00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:23.640
but I think maybe let's just touch on one more kind of fun.


00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:27.160
And that is the, people can go and play with this.


00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.460
That's the bungee dunk.


00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.380
Do you want to tell people what kind of insanity


00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:32.460
a bungee dunk is?


00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:34.960
And then you can just talk about this modeling problem


00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.760
as a way to say some human being put their body in jeopardy


00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.040
to test this theory, right?


00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.880
Tell us about this.


00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:42.700
- Yes, okay.


00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.800
So this was partly prompted by this video,


00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.300
which shows a person doing a bungee jump.


00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:49.660
So they're jumping off a crane.


00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.420
They have a bungee cord attached to their ankles.


00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:55.880
And when the cord is stretched out and fully extended,


00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:59.820
They are about four feet from the ground


00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:04.100
and they can reach out and the person jumping has a cookie


00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:06.520
or a biscuit because they're in the UK.


00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.440
And they dunk the cookie into a cup of tea


00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.920
that is on a dock at the bottom of this.


00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:15.080
And I forget the number, was it 30 meters?


00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:15.920
But it was a world record.


00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.920
- Yeah, something like that, yeah.


00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.480
It was way too far for a person to do that with their body.


00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:21.320
- Now, and part of this is that the object--


00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.560
- No, the video shows them,


00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:25.620
literally they come to a complete stop


00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:27.460
because the way the springs work


00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:30.540
and they are right at where they literally do dunk


00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:33.300
this biscuit into the tee and then shoot back up


00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:36.460
for the back and forth oscillation by Huxlaw


00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:37.740
of the bungee, right?


00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.020
- You got it, right.


00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:42.500
Now the margin of error here is low.


00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.340
Most people want to do a bungee jump to not do this


00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:49.560
because if it just turns out that he had extended


00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.660
about two meters more than he expected to,


00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:54.820
he would have at least hit the plank


00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:56.700
And he was over a body of water,


00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:58.480
so maybe it's not a catastrophe,


00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.460
but it was a risky thing to do.


01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.300
- Yeah, at a minimum, it's gonna hurt.


01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.140
- Yes.


01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:03.980
(laughing)


01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:05.760
- Yeah, so you basically, you go through the idea of like,


01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.620
well, if you wanted to try,


01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.140
the record was 70 meters.


01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:11.980
- Oh, okay.


01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:13.780
- So that is way up there.


01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:15.340
So, (laughing)


01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.820
that's way up there.


01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.280
So if you wanted to say, you know what,


01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.380
guy with a cool beard that currently holds


01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.960
the Guinness Book of World Records,


01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.460
we have pandas, we have notebooks,


01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:26.100
we're going to beat this, right?


01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:29.460
You could go through and model all the details out.


01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.900
And you talked through some of the assumptions,


01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.300
like the bungee will not apply a slowing force to you


01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:38.060
until it fully extends the slack length of the bungee.


01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:41.620
And then it is a perfect spring and on and on, right?


01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:42.460
- Right.


01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.860
But here's where there is some interesting physics.


01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:47.300
So here was the other motivation for this problem.


01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.940
Remember, thinking about modeling decisions,


01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.980
what can you leave out and what do you have to include


01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.360
in order to get a precise answer.


01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.500
So in this scenario, air resistance is definitely a factor.


01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.960
And the stretch of the spring and its restoring force


01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.460
is definitely a factor.


01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.100
But here's the interesting part.


01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.220
During the first phase of the jump,


01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:11.480
while the bungee cord is not yet stretching,


01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.200
but it is uncoiling,


01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.580
because it starts out in a great big U shape,


01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.220
it's dangling down,


01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:22.220
and it has to unravel or unwrap itself as you are falling.


01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.780
The first model that you probably think of


01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.820
is that it's just free fall,


01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:30.060
that you are being pulled by the force of gravity


01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.260
and the bungee cord is being pulled by the force of gravity.


01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:36.220
And so there's no net interaction between the two.


01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.860
And so you would think it would be just,


01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.900
your acceleration would be equal to G,


01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.140
9.8 meters per second squared.


01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.060
And that's what turns out not to be true.


01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.460
And it's not at all obvious,


01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.540
but there is an interaction with the cord.


01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.660
It is transferring momentum from the cord to you.


01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.340
It's an alias to a whip action.


01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.340
And the net effect is that you accelerate faster


01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:59.700
than gravity because the cord is actually pulling you down.


01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:03.500
It turns out that the difference you would be off by


01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.280
if you ignore this effect,


01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.700
you would be off by about two meters, which is.


01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.900
- And that's gonna be a problem.


01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.140
- That was your margin of error.


01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.180
Right.


01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:15.940
So there's a nice physics paper that explains this.


01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.700
And there's a really nice Veritasium video


01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:25.140
that explains the phenomenon and does a really compelling demonstration that shows that it's true.


01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:28.020
Veritasium is fantastic for this kind of stuff.


01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:31.380
It's a YouTube channel that does these kinds of experiments.


01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.500
A little bit like the Discovery Show, but way better.


01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.500
They're really good.


01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:39.700
Did you see the downwind sort of sailboat, but a sail car?


01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:40.940
No, I don't.


01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.420
Oh, maybe I did actually see that.


01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:43.740
Yeah, I think I did.


01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:44.500
That one's very good.


01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.260
It's been a while.


01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.020
Yeah.


01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:49.100
I'll see if I can find the channel and put it up in the show notes for people.


01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:54.940
All right, I think with that, we probably should call it for time, but very interesting.


01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:59.820
People don't actually recommend you go try to break the bungee dunk record.


01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:00.460
Yeah, no.


01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:00.940
Do something else.


01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.460
But if you do it...


01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.340
It is fun to watch.


01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:04.620
Yeah, make a good model.


01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:10.620
Exactly. Make a good model and let us know. We'll share it, but we don't recommend it.


01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.060
All right, final two questions before we get out of here, Alan.


01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.940
You're going to write some Python code. What editor do you use?


01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:22.140
I'm using mostly Jupyter notebooks, but also a little bit of VS Code.


01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.340
Okay. For notebooks, is it straight Jupyter? Is it JupyterLab?


01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.460
Well, I just had JupyterLab 4.0 come out, which is a big update.


01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.820
I know. And every time JupyterLab gets better, I think,


01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:34.780
now's the time for me to make the switch. But I have not.


01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:38.860
And partly it's familiarity, and partly as a teaching environment,


01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.980
I prefer a simple environment with the minimum distraction.


01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:43.980
Sure. That's certainly valid.


01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:47.060
All right, and notable PyPI package,


01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.620
conda package if you prefer.


01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:54.220
Right. Well, I have to say the SciPy, NumPy, Pandas,


01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:57.460
those were the primary things I was using for this book.


01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:00.980
And then maybe a shout out to Pint, which as I said,


01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.940
I think it's not quite doing everything I want,


01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.980
but I think it's a really great tool.


01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.220
Excellent. Yeah, I agree.


01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:07.660
All right. People are interested.


01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:08.820
They want to check out your book.


01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:11.260
I'll put the link in the show notes.


01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:14.180
There's Jupyter Notebooks up on Google Colab.


01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:18.020
If you're feeling brave, you can create your own virtual environment,


01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.940
install them locally and run them there as well.


01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:20.900
That works too.


01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:21.820
Anything else you want to say?


01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:22.860
How people get started with this book?


01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.180
- I, you know, the idea is to just get you into it.


01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.780
There are some case studies and a lot of chances


01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:32.460
to take whatever system you're interested in and apply these tools.


01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.460
So I hope people enjoy it.


01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.300
And if you do anything interesting with it, let me know.


01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:37.980
