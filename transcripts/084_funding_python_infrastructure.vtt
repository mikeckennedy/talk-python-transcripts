00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.700
When was the last time you used a third-party package in Python?

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.260
Have you recently pip installed SQLAlchemy?

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.780
Maybe you looked up the documentation on a package you found in PyPI?

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.980
These two core pieces of infrastructure involved are both freely available and open source,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.540
PIP and PyPI, as well as read the docs.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.700
How are these funded?

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700
How well are they funded?

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.380
It turns out that we are not doing a good job sustaining the underlying infrastructure

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.800
in the Python ecosystem.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.780
This week, you'll meet four panelists for a discussion on the problem and its solutions.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.260
Donald Stuff from PyPI and PIP, Eric Holscher, co-founder of Read the Docs, Carol Willing,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.280
director of the Python Software Foundation and Project Jupyter core developer, and Eva Jalaska,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.540
director of operations at the Python Software Foundation.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.960
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 84, recorded October 31, 2016.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.620
Developers, developers, developers, developers.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.920
I'm a developer in many senses of the word, because I make these applications, but I also

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.120
use these verbs to make this music.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.680
I construct it line by line, just like when I'm coding another software design.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.880
In both cases, it's about design patterns.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.380
Anyone can get the job done.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.880
It's the execution that matters.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.360
I have many interests.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.020
Sometimes...

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.220
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.740
ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.880
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.860
Follow me on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.760

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.360
And follow the show on Twitter via at talkpython.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.560
This episode has been sponsored by Rollbar and GoCD.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.680
Thank them both for supporting the podcast by checking out what they're offering during

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.240
their segments.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.660
Hey, everyone.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.480
I'm honored to be sharing this important conversation with you.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.500
Thanks for listening to this episode and all the others.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.060
The community response to this podcast and my online courses has been simply amazing and

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.420
humbling.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.000
You've encouraged me to dedicate some more time and energy to the project.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.300
So before we get to the panel discussion, I want to tell you about a new project I'm launching

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.500
today, November 8th, 2016.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.480
I'm launching a new second podcast called Python Bytes.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.060
You can find it at pythonbytes.fm.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.740
That's pythonbytes.fm.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.960
Please take a moment to listen to the first episode and provide feedback.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.820
The goal of the show is to deliver timely Python developer headlines directly to your earbuds.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.920
I'm co-hosting the show with Brian Okken of Test and Code Podcast fame.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.060
We try to keep this short and sweet.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.100
So this show should be about 15 minutes per episode.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.520
So please check it out at pythonbytes.fm.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.000
Now let's talk about funding Python's open source infrastructure.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.060
Hey everyone, welcome to Talk Python.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.880
I'm really excited to have you here to talk about this pretty important topic of funding

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.080
open source infrastructure and some of the things that are actually the underpinnings

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.980
of the Python ecosystem itself.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.900
So welcome.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.680
Let's get started with a quick introduction.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.160
Got four of you on the show this week and that is really excellent.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.940
I think it's going to give us a lot of perspectives.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.720
So I'd like to start with what's your background?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.260
Why are you particularly passionate or interested in Python's open source infrastructure in particular?

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.600
And Carol, let's start with you.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.900
Hi, thanks, Michael.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.280
I am Carol Willing.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.820
I am a director of the Python Software Foundation and also a core developer on Project Jupyter at Cal Poly.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.940
I have a background in econometrics and economics as well as engineering.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.920
And I really care about the infrastructure because it supports so much of what we do in education,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.440
whether at the university level or on the K through 12 level in the states as well as globally.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.180
Yeah, excellent.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.640
It's super important education.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:57.380
I think one of the great growth areas of Python and a lot of interesting new projects and people are coming into it is coming from academics and from the data science space.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.360
And so that's right, right in there.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.540
Eva, how about you?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.720
My name is Eva Jalowska.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.980
I am the director of operations at the Python Software Foundation.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.540
Even though I do have a little bit of technical experience, all of my Python involvement has been community related.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.020
I did get involved with the PSF as a third party meeting planner working on PyCon.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.160
And that started in 2008.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.220
In 2011, I did a career shift and joined the PSF exclusively to work on PyCon and other foundation activities.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.680
In mid-2015, we began to hire additional staff.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.340
And at that time, my role evolved to director of operations.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.100
And even though PyCon is still a responsibility of mine, I now concentrate more on managing our staff and foundation sustainability,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.680
which includes everything from how we internally operate to how we can best serve the Python community.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.600
And that is why Python infrastructure is important to me.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.500
All right.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.860
Excellent.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.920
Eric, how about you?

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.360
Yeah.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.320
So I'm Eric Holscher.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.980
And folks on this podcast probably know me most from kind of the work I do around read the docs.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:10.980
And so I think, you know, both Donald with PyPI and myself are in a very similar position where we're running kind of large infrastructure.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.200
infrastructure projects that don't have or they don't necessarily feel like they have the largest amount of community support.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.320
And I think we're trying to kind of raise awareness around how that might be an issue going forward.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.660
And so there's definitely kind of a selfish motive for kind of having my own work be funded better and more supported,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.680
as well as kind of being able to build things like this within the community and kind of setting examples of models.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.640
So if people want to build more infrastructure to support the community, there is actually a model for making that sustainable so more of it can happen.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.140
I think that's kind of my angle on it.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.500
Yeah.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.820
Okay.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.380
Great.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.720
Thanks.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.180
And Donald, you were on episode 64 and you shared a lot of the work that you've been doing with PyPI.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.440
But go ahead and tell everyone about yourself for this episode.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.800
Yeah.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.900
So I'm Donald Stuff.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:05.220
And, you know, I work on PyPI and pip and sort of Disutils, the sort of related projects for Python's packaging story.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:14.560
In that regard, I run operations for PyPI and I'm sort of the primary developer and operations on both PyPI and PIP.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.400
There are other people who will help out.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:26.100
But as I was currently being paid my time for that and that enabled me to spend a lot more time than other people were able to.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:35.780
I suppose it sends a little bit of a mixed message about whether the project needs help if there's somebody whose full-time job is to work on an open source project, right?

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.800
Like PyPI.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.920
What do you think?

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.840
It's sort of a dangerous place to be in.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.200
I mean, full transparency, I was just laid off from my job.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.700
So I am no longer employed full-time to do that.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:07:02.180
And it's dangerous because now that I'm laid off, all of a sudden we just lost the only full-time employee working on that project, which is a huge loss of hours available to dedicate to different resources in that space.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.580
Yeah.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:13.380
And that whole experience, you talked about it on Twitter and saying it was not like HP decided they were going to defund PyPI or anything like that.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.720
It was just, you know, HP is going through some challenges.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:24.280
They laid off a bunch of people and it just so happened they, I guess, felt like this funding for PyPI didn't really match with what they were doing anymore.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.340
And I want to be really clear to everyone listening that this is not to throw HP under the bus, right?

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.940
Like HP was doing more than any other company out there to fund PyPI.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:41.500
The fact that they, like, stepped back to being on par with the other companies is unfortunate, but it's not like we should be unhappy with HP.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.360
It's more like, well, wait a minute.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:55.500
Why did we have just this one company that happened to, like, more or less donate an employee to run the most important way that libraries are shared in Python, right?

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:55.900
Yeah.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.320
And, you know, as far as I can tell, they actually didn't even know they were defunding PyPI.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:01.480
Yeah.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.280
You know, this is a fairly large scale layoff and my entire team got dissolved.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:18.600
So as far as I've been told, you know, I just got caught in a large net and there was no sort of knowledge that PyPI was even a thing at the level that this was being taken place of.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.500
Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:28.600
So I, you know, you and I spoke for an hour on episode 64 about Python packaging and what PyPI is, among many other things.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.340
But let's start this conversation by kind of laying out the elements that are in play here.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.900
So, Eric, you talked about read the docs.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.220
We've talked about PyPI.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:46.740
But, Eric, what other stuff do you think is under this banner of open source infrastructure and the Python ecosystem?

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.980
I mean, I think those are the two big projects.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:55.240
I think also kind of the Conda ecosystem around scientific Python is another place.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.660
I think a lot of it is, at this point, kind of companies.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:05.640
So things like, you know, Travis CI is a huge point where a lot of the open source infrastructure is built on that.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.660
And they've actually been building a sustainable business around that.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.840
But I think if, you know, if Travis CI went away tomorrow, that would have huge impacts on kind of the Python developer ecosystem.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:24.060
Yeah, and really just kind of all that entire kind of suite of developer tools that people are kind of using on their day to day.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:30.840
And, yeah, but I think in terms of kind of Python specifically, I think, you know, pip and, you know, PyPI are the most obvious.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.960
And I think read the docs and other just tools that developers are using.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.120
And, you know, maybe someone else will have a better kind of more encompassing answer.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:48.620
I think, you know, in some regards, kind of Twitter and GitHub, right, are also both in that basket where we have these massive corporations running these for us for free.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.780
And that's very much infrastructure we depend on.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.240
But, you know, that's a little bit less precarious because they are building kind of businesses around them.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:03.960
But there are some other issues with that, for sure, as you see, maybe with something like NPM being the kind of most analogous to PyPI.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:04.660
Right.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.220
Yeah, and NPM does apply to Python developers.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:18.500
There's a lot of tools that you get from NPM as well as anytime we're building web frameworks, we probably want to go get some JavaScript stuff as well just for the front end work.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:31.320
You know, I think, first of all, one of the things I would like to discuss or sort of point out that you guys might not, people who are listening might not realize, is the scale of the cost of some of these projects.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.780
So for PyPI, Donald, obviously, you were being employed to work on it and there's your time.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.780
But there's also actual infrastructure expenses.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:44.800
And luckily, from what I understand, those are still being covered by places like Rackspace and so on.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:58.440
But for PyPI, you said last May we had 340 terabytes of traffic and that was roughly $35,000 a month in infrastructure expenses, right?

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.200
Yeah.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:06.040
Yeah, so we've now gotten to the point where I believe the last 30 days we've hit 390 terabytes of bandwidth.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:14.160
So we're starting to push closer to $40,000 a month in donated services.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.700
That's what the cost would be if we actually paid for that.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.500
We are very lucky that we have a Fastly Rackspace Dream host.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.800
I can't list them all.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.340
But there's eight or ten different companies that donate those services to us.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.240
But yeah, it's a significant cost without those donations.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.040
We would not be able to bear the cost of doing that.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.380
Yeah.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:42.360
Even a very happy donor couldn't – very unlikely that they could handle that much of an expense on a monthly basis.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.500
Eva, what do you think about funding some of these projects?

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.340
Like where's the current funding coming from?

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:58.320
You know, Donald talked a little bit about HP and the guys donating at Rackspace, donating bandwidth and to the other companies as well.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.860
But where else does funding come from?

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:07.460
So most of it, as already everyone mentioned, is through in-kind sponsorship.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:14.780
So everything from server providers, CDN management providers, search optimizers, et cetera, even to design work.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.280
For instance, if you look – I know that Donald said he couldn't list all of them.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:24.440
But if you look at the bottom of pypi.org, you can see all the logos of the donated services that Donald has received.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.800
Obviously, the main one has been HP employing Donald.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.900
And we also make up a lot of that through volunteer time.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:38.060
We have a lot of volunteers that work and put a lot of time into making it happen.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:44.120
And up to March of this year, the PSF infrastructure was completely managed by volunteers.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:51.860
And then in March, we decided to hire an IT manager who is slowly gaining his bearings around the ecosystem.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.500
The PSF does fund a little bit.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.260
We do, for instance, maintain domains and things like that and other random charges.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.800
Sometimes it happens for certificates or things like that.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:10.720
But we do have, for instance, other – and I wanted to kind of go back a little bit because there are a lot more infrastructure than just dev tools, in my opinion,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:18.020
especially since we do a lot of the day-to-day foundation stuff like mail.python.org or even our wiki.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.880
That's, I guess, more internally used.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.420
But I have an example.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:27.940
For instance, for mail.python.org, last year, the server went belly up.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.760
And this was before we had our IT manager.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:45.620
And when you're in peak PyCon sponsorship sign-up time and you don't have mail for four days, that could be a very extreme thing.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.940
So it actually took us four days, including the weekend, to be able to restore it.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:55.000
And we had to search down volunteers who were no longer active and that had – we had to find who had backups.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.820
But I can't help to wonder, like, what if those volunteers weren't available that weekend?

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.160
What would we have done?

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.900
So it's kind of questions like that that makes us really think, how can we improve the funding?

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:16.820
Yeah, so there's the keeping the organization running, and then there's the public-facing stuff like PyPI and read the docs.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.820
Yeah.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.440
Yeah.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.920
Any other funding, Carol, that you can think of?

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.040
Other things that we should maybe throw under this?

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.280
What is open source infrastructure for the Python community?

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:44.160
Yeah, I think that there's key infrastructure that, you know, have a fixed cost that, you know, a lot of our sponsors have very generously given us time or services in order to have even the base technology to run things on.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:15:11.800
And then if you look at the team that's in place from an infrastructure standpoint for just running the Python Software Foundation, it's like a hugely leaned startup with Eva and her crew running a 24-7 global organization pushing around terabytes of data and with volunteers largely being the staff that gets things done.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:28.020
And, you know, my concern is to be able to sustain the fixed costs of the infrastructure over time, but also be able to have some variable resources that are funded so that we're not burning out volunteers.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:38.580
I mean, Donald was very generously funded by HP, but his time and effort went far beyond just his salary for the day.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.820
And, you know, we all owe him a huge thank you for that.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.100
And the same with Eric on Read the Docs.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:57.140
It's a labor of love as well as a key part of our infrastructure, as is PyVideo.org, our user groups, being able to fund scholarships for us to grow the community.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:02.000
So I think infrastructure really sort of touches everything that we do.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.240
Yeah, that's a really interesting view.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:10.520
I just interviewed Paul Logsdon from PyVideo, and that's coming out of the week of this one being recorded.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.500
So that's a really interesting one as well.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.700
Eric, can you speak to Read the Docs a little bit?

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.520
And how, you know, what's the expenses?

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.040
How do you guys keep that running there?

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.980
Sure.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:23.560
Yeah.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:33.260
And just to kind of follow on quickly with Carol's point, I think, yeah, like the staff of PyCon as well is just this amazing, like this unreasonable, amazing outpouring of love from the community.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:39.420
And all of that staff is volunteer, except for, you know, a few people at the top, but the hours that go into running events like that.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.800
I mean, I have my own conference night, I know.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.420
So, yeah, there's so much work that we all depend on as a community.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:50.120
But, yeah, so anyway, the costs of Read the Docs, similarly, are paid for by Rackspace.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:59.000
I think Rackspace is like one of these people where if their sponsorship of open source and the Python community as well went away, these massive things.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I know, like the cryptography project that's doing a bunch of really good crypto stuff.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.660
I mean, there's so many backbone kind of CI tools and servers and all these costs of all of the projects around the Python ecosystem that Rackspace is putting the bill for.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.820
And if that ever went away, there would be a huge kind of scramble, I think.

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.680
And that's another just huge piece of infrastructure, all these servers, everything's running on.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.780
Our recent bill from Rackspace was, I believe, $3,600.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:30.020
So we keep our server costs incredibly low for the amount of things that we're doing.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.380
I think we do about 25 million page views.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.340
I think we push close to 10 terabytes of data.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.740
But mostly we're serving static files.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:48.980
So we have a very kind of low cost of infrastructure based on the – and a lot of that was architectural decisions that we made because we knew the funding environment that we were existing within.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.760
So everything is very lean.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.000
Yeah, similarly, the main cost is people.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:05.080
Operations person who's wearing a pager to make sure the Python community's documentation goes down has a market rate of easily $100,000 a year, at least within the U.S. kind of pay scales.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:11.940
And so that dwarfs the, what, $40,000 to $50,000 that we would pay in pure infrastructure costs.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:17.620
But that said, if Rackspace did go away, that would be a huge – there would be a huge scramble for us to kind of cover that cost.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.020
Yeah.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:25.100
You mentioned GitHub, and if it went away, there would definitely be terrible disturbance in the forest sort of feeling.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:30.000
Are there contingency plans for if Rackspace backed up?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.020
Because, you know, this is the common theme, and thank you so much, Rackspace, for being such a supporter, right?

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.460
But it's also becoming like a single point of failure.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.020
Do you guys know what you would do?

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.720
We've had a few different people offer.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.620
I mean, I think, honestly, the initial step would probably be to stop doing builds.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:55.840
Because a lot of the cost of servers is the build infrastructure, and if we just stuck, you know, static files up somewhere, that would be a viable alternative for at least like a week or something.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:04.820
And, you know, like somebody maybe couldn't release a new library, but the 99% case is still kind of, you know, the old documentation that we host for everyone would still be available.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.560
And I'm sure we could find yet another, you know, donated service.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:21.140
But kind of the plan B was so scary for so long that it kind of really did spur us to start looking into business models and kind of sustainability on our own, because that was kind of a scary outcome, right?

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:30.760
And I think similar to having one company employ someone to work primarily on a project, I think having one company hosting all of the infrastructure for free, right?

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.260
Like it builds this kind of all the eggs in one basket scenario.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:43.440
And I think there's, like I'd never even really considered Rackspace in that light, but I think if we really took a deep look at our community, we would find we have a lot of our eggs in a very small number of baskets.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:56.440
And, you know, I think Russ Keith McGee, who's one of the really people that I've been watching talk about this for a while, says, you know, we really need like kind of that diversity in funding and support to really have something that's truly sustainable.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:10.240
And so I think that that's definitely the path we need to look down is, you know, how do we reduce dependence on these small set of very generous companies and towards something that's more kind of inclusive of the entire community, supporting the entire community?

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.400
Yeah, I agree.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:20.040
I think it's really a positive thing that you guys have write the docs and all the stuff that's starting to take shape as a business there.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:25.680
Do you want to spend just a moment and tell people about what you're doing to make that a little more sustainable?

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:31.300
Yeah, so we actually, we turned, we built like an official kind of business around Read the Docs two years ago.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:46.640
The conferences are actually a completely separate endeavor that just kind of are connected through me as a human, which is also its own business, which is also, you know, building into a sustainable, you know, we have, we're going to have similar to Python, have kind of a part time to start operations person.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:54.460
But with Read the Docs, we basically tried a bunch of different models that everyone's talked about, you know, consulting, support contracts, all this stuff.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:09.640
And it turns out that kind of like, unlike a database or an operating system, documentation is not mission critical enough within most organizations for them to pay for support contracts, or training or these things, you know, where we're kind of very much a second thought in a lot of development organizations.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:16.160
And so I think that's been really hampering our ability to use some of the more traditional business models that have worked in open source.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:25.940
And so we basically fell back on advertising, which is, you know, kind of the one true business model on the internet that works for paid or for free sites, right?

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:37.380
Like every large free website on the internet, especially, you know, if you view Read the Docs as a content publisher, which at the end of the day, we really are, you know, we're very similar to, you know, a newspaper in those terms, right?

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.460
Advertising is the model, right?

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:44.600
Like everyone that's reading documentation on Read the Docs is never going to pay us money, even one penny, right?

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:56.240
Like there's so many more readers to writers or maintainers that the only way to kind of manifest value from those very small interactions is to put an ad on it and to have someone pay you for that small amount of attention.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:02.160
And so we basically set out to build a advertising business model that we are proud of.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.560
And so we're not tracking our users.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.720
We're doing one ad per page.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.780
It's kind of at the bottom of the sidebar, so it's not in your way.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:13.740
And so we're really trying to kind of build a model that respects users and kind of respects advertisers and can be a win-win.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:20.000
And so we call it kind of newspaper advertising on the internet, just because it's like, you know, we put a, we know people are here.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.300
We're going to put an image on a page.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.380
Some people are going to look at it and they're going to click it and you're going to pay us for that privilege.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.860
And so we're really trying to kind of build an ad product that we can be proud of.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:34.220
I think it's really interesting and it's worth talking about because the other business models are really hard.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:45.000
like how could you possibly ask somebody to like say as a publisher on there to say to pay at least the people who are doing free open source work,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:53.740
basically as a volunteer on their own project, like having them pay to use the site is like insult to injury because they're trying to write docs for the community for free.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.200
And you're like, well, you got to pay to do that.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:03.240
You're like, so a lot of the models, like you said, are, are challenging, but luckily both PyPI and read the docs have a tremendous amount of traffic.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.180
So there's a possibility that some kind of ad story does make sense.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.000
Carol, what do you think?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.800
What do you got some ideas around this ad stuff?

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.240
Wow.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.940
You know, I think ads probably have a whole range of people's viewpoints on them.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:31.020
I think I know when read the docs kind of went to the ad model, we had some people that were really for it and some people that were sort of questioning, like, I don't know that I want ads in my documentation.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:42.080
Personally, like we worked through on the Jupyter project that the ads were subtle enough that we felt like sustaining the ecosystem of read the docs.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:53.960
And I'm, you know, I spend a lot of time writing documentation as a developer because I think it's so important and critical for onboarding people and for developers to build their skills.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:03.500
So, you know, I think advertising, it will get you some of the way and obviously all the things that we've done to date were here.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:15.480
These things are functioning, but oftentimes it feels like you're holding it together with like scotch tape and a lot of goodwill and ongoing goodwill from the sponsors that we have.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:26.320
So the question is really, in my view, how do you, you know, we're sort of facing like a classic problem in economics where who funds the infrastructure?

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:34.560
Like in a country, the infrastructure like roads, law enforcement, hospitals are largely funded by the government.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.320
And so we're not directly paying for everything.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.440
And I think we see similar things in open source.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:50.080
Many people benefit from, let's say, PyPI, for example, whether or not they contribute to it.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:59.380
And so you've got like that classic economics, free riders getting the benefit, but not contributing anything to receive the benefit.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.540
And I'm not sure how you necessarily get that.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.040
Right.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.800
It's so challenging to take it back to like your country analogy.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:13.040
One of the ways countries deal with that is they come up with toll roads, right?

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.100
Or toll bridges or things like that.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.280
And.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:16.980
Absolutely.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.980
Those.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.360
I personally find all of those things very distasteful.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.140
I don't like.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:28.100
I used to live in New Jersey and I felt like I would drive like five miles and stop and pay a dime, drive six miles, pay a quarter.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.100
And I was just always at traffic jams paying like such a small.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:37.820
Like, why couldn't we just add a little bit of a gas tax or something like this that sort of solved the problem instead of trying.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.720
This thing is costing too much.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.380
So we're going to patch a little fee onto it or something.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.680
And I feel like there's some analogies here as well.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.120
Yeah.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:50.060
I also grew up in New Jersey and I can remember having to pay to actually go to the beach.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.940
You know, you need a little badge on some of the beaches.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:26:00.680
You'd have to pay five, ten bucks, whatever it was to actually step foot on the beach, which on the West Coast we think is sort of very strange.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.600
It's very strange.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:01.800
Yeah.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:07.160
But I think certainly paying for service is one model.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:15.360
But I think much like you, I think it's not something that necessarily is attractive to many people.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.000
It benefits those that have money to pay for it versus the general community.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.900
And like you said, it's an annoyance.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:28.660
So I think there's got to be other nonprofit models that might be better suited.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.360
And I won't profess to know the solution, but something different.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:33.780
Yeah.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:39.160
We definitely don't want to bring some kind of model to this whole place that would kill the delight, right?

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.640
Kill the joy.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:40.960
Absolutely.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.340
Yeah.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.700
Because that's something that's really special.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.220
Eva, how does the PSF pay for itself?

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.220
The majority of the PSF's budget comes from PyCon.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:54.200
PyCon is our main expense and it's also our main source of revenue.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:27:03.100
My team and I work very hard every year to try to be in the positive after each PyCon, especially since it's so vital to the foundation's sustainability.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:13.440
That revenue helps us with future PyCon expenses as well as it helps the PSF have a budget for grants that we give out, which do help grow and strengthen the community.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.980
Some of these grants are infrastructure related.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:21.660
For example, the PSF has given financial support to read slash write the docs.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:29.860
And we recently even granted our Python packaging work group, which Donald and I are on, a grant to be used as needed.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:38.760
We want to be able to do more of it, but it is not sustainable for the PSF at the moment to fully support all of these projects.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:48.320
In addition to the importance of funding the infrastructure that the PSF oversees, we have other operations that need our financial attention.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:55.360
For example, the grants that the PSF disburses have been increasing approximately $65,000 year on year.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.660
So that is another important aspect I have to consider when planning the foundation's future.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:08.340
I mean, this is a little bit off topic, but if anyone's interested, I did cover this at PyGotham this year, so we can check it out for more details.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:19.620
We do have sponsorship support year on year from corporations, but surprisingly, that is a small percentage of where funds come from.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:27.200
We are hoping to continue to grow our staff, so we are internally working on how we can increase the foundation's corporate support.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:37.580
My short-term goal is to improve our sponsorship perspectives, for example, by including some targeted traffic data from, let's say, PyPI to give to organizations.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:55.760
This portion of Talk Python to me has been brought to you by Rollbar.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.280
One of the frustrating things about being a developer is dealing with errors.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:07.460
Relying on users to report errors, digging through log files trying to debug issues, or a million alerts just flooding your inbox and ruining your day.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:14.700
With Rollbar's full-stack error monitoring, you'll get the context, insights, and control that you need to find and fix bugs faster.

Go to rollbar.com slash Talk Python to me.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:20.380
Donald, have you considered any other models like what Read the Docs is doing or anything for PyPI?

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.680
I mean, you do have a tremendous amount of traffic there.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.720
Yeah, so I considered ads briefly.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:34.560
We didn't need them yet, so I kind of put it on the back burner because I do think people have sort of a – ads are polarizing.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.100
And the less I get yelled at, the better.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:39.900
Yeah.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:49.760
But there are other things we've talked about, like the ability to host private packages on PyPI and pay for that privilege.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:57.280
But then that starts to get into more questions like, well, if we start turning PyPI into sort of a business but still a nonprofit,

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:02.620
are the sponsors that have been donating resources to us, how are they going to feel about that?

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:08.460
Are we going to suddenly look at having to pay $40,000 a month if we start doing that?

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:19.500
So it's sort of like walking a bit on a tightrope wanting to not do something that's going to make these people feel like they're investing or donating to a business.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.060
Yes.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:23.260
While still being able to try to be more sustainable.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.080
That's a very careful balance.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.980
And I think it's tricky, right?

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.560
And I don't want to make this conversation all about ads.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.540
I don't necessarily think the solution is ads, but they're like an easy solution, right?

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.640
You can easily throw them up.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:41.560
And as long as you control the site, like read the docs, for example, it's not hugely in the way for anybody.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.980
Michael, can I jump in with one comment on this?

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.380
Yeah, please do.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:44.660
Go ahead.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:48.320
Sort of bridging what both Eva said and Donald said.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:32:00.800
I think one thing that we could do is perhaps leverage better instead of ads, but use the site to really honor and thank the sponsors.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:11.380
And to give the sponsors some greater visibility on the sites for actually taking the time and belief and effort to sponsor us.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.540
Yeah, that's a really good point.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:18.940
You know, maybe this is a good time we could sort of switch to trying to brainstorm about what can we do.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.120
I mean, we've sort of been circling around that a little bit and what people have tried.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.060
Maybe what could or should we try?

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:33.280
I think having the sponsors highlighted really clearly could easily make it more appealing to sponsor these projects, right?

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.600
Like if it was a small icon logo at the bottom of like the homepage, that's one thing.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:48.020
It's another if Rackspace gets to somehow be featured or Red Hat gets to somehow be featured in like a thing that is relevant to them, right?

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:52.660
Maybe, for example, on the stuff to do with cloud computing.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:56.320
Red Hat gets a little, you know, like the packages to do with cloud computing.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:02.700
Maybe Red Hat gets some sort of visibility for, say, OpenStack and similarly for Rackspace.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.660
You know, something like that.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.600
Eric, what do you think?

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.700
So we actually have been thinking a lot about this.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.720
I mean, we don't do things quickly and without thought.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:17.280
And so one of the big things is we formed as a business and not a nonprofit because basically we do this as trying to prove a model.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.460
And so we don't want to constrain ourselves.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:26.960
And so when we looked at doing a nonprofit and what they're allowed to do in terms of, you know, quote unquote sponsorship, you're basically allowed to do advertising.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.580
But there can't be a call to action is at least the way that I understand it.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.460
So you see this, you know, similar.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:38.860
Django is doing this where they actually have a more visible thank you to their donors in the documentation.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.020
But it's very much a, you know, thank you, Red Hat for sponsoring or, you know, thank you, you know, whoever.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.700
They can't say, you know, come buy our new product for $10 off this month.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.680
And so that is the fundamental difference.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:50.900
Right.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:56.500
And so we thought as we try and kind of prove this model and really think through it, we didn't want those constraints.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.360
But some of the people we're talking to very much do just want that kind of more sponsorship model.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:11.780
And so really our goal in the long term is to build an ad business to the point where we're able to transition that with our existing sponsors to a more nonprofit sponsorship model.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:18.160
But really to start, we saw, you know, the Django Software Foundation did this and they are they have not hit their goal for the year.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:24.220
Just in a traditional kind of nonprofit donation model, even with a more visible thank you.

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.340
Whereas Django REST framework actually has been successful with this model.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.220
And so, you know, there's there's a little bit of different conflicting views.

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:38.860
But I think definitely kind of, you know, making the sponsors feel like they're getting something for their money is really the value.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:46.900
And so we went kind of purely for trying to build a model where we could actually give sponsors the most value possible.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:55.880
And then if we're successful in that and I can, you know, pay my rent each month, then we can start to impose more kind of strict regulations on what we're able to do.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:08.160
But by starting kind of as a nonprofit or as a for profit and allowing ourselves to kind of transition into a more kind of nonprofit style model, it gives us more flexibility to get it off the ground.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.500
That's an interesting point that you need the room to experiment.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:24.340
I think this is a pretty new space of trying to take a thing that was basically for free and turn it into a business, especially a thing that is free and people donated freely to it and turn it into a business.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.600
That's a real interesting challenge, right?

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.420
And so I did.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.380
Actually, if I can add to that a little bit.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.560
Sorry to interrupt.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.380
Yeah, go ahead.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:46.180
So at the PSF, we actually do have maybe a different form of what we're discussing called success stories where we so this was developed in the redesign for the website, but it's not used as much as I would like it to be.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:36:00.400
So pretty much what we do is we say to our sponsors, especially top level sponsors, say, hey, why don't you write us a success story that we can post on our website of how Python has helped your organization grow or to where it is today?

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:13.000
And I think that if we could maybe use that as a way to expose our sponsors more, I think it would not only please our sponsors, but it would please the community because it just wouldn't be like, hey, buy this product.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.460
Right.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:13.740
Okay.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.580
That's interesting.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.180
Yeah.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:25.400
People basically get to highlight how they're using Python in whatever area they're interested in, like whatever in their cloud computing platform, if they're a cloud provider or something like that, right?

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:25.960
Exactly.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.520
Yeah.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.060
Eric, you were going to say something as well.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:36.220
Oh, yeah, I was just going to speak to Donald's point because I think it is super important that we did actually spin up a paid hosted model.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.440
And that is actually a separate entity.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.740
It's at readthedocs.com and it is a completely separate thing.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:47.840
And so that's kind of how we were hoping to address that balance between, you know, you're not paying to donate to a business.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:57.960
The advertising on readthedocs.org supports the readthedocs.org hosting and kind of costs, not hosting because Rackspace pays, but, you know, the cost of maintenance of that platform.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.480
And so you're not donating to a business, right?

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.700
You're just allowing.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.160
It's one method that we're generating income to become sustainable.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.520
Not, you know, I'm not like lining my pockets, you know, with ad money or whatever.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:09.860
Right.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.120
And so that is something we thought a lot about.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.240
And we have provisions.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.660
We have different, you know, entities and all that kind of stuff.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.580
That's something we are really, I think, is super important, right?

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:24.360
You can't just be like, hey, we're going to start making money now and expect people to kind of, you know, donate to a business.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.200
It does have to be done kind of thoughtfully.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.980
Donald, your point was really interesting.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:32.140
And I think it touches on one angle of what I think is a very careful balance.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:39.960
Like, what if PyPI, let's say, went to some kind of business model that was, well, it looked like a business, like you said.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.980
And the business was doing okay.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.100
It was making $10,000 a month.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.740
And then the people who donated to it said, you have a business.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:47.820
Why would we donate to you?

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.080
We were pulling our $40,000 a month funding.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.940
You know, all of a sudden, you know, you've killed the golden goose by trying to keep it alive, right?

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:55.740
Yeah.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:59.080
And to their credit, I have not actually talked to them about this.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:17.860
It has been one of my concerns when I've talked to people about ideas about how we can, you know, sort of bring in some more money into PyPI in order to enable us to, you know, maybe hire more people to develop it or pay for some services where we weren't able to get donations, you know, things like that.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:25.860
And, you know, that's been sort of one of the big concerns there is how are these donors going to look at that.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:33.300
And, you know, we do try to, when we develop it, not depend too much on one specific donor.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.060
So we do try to spread out over multiple.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:39.860
We do try to develop things so that we're not developing just some sort of proprietary API.

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:45.240
If we do, it's shimmed in in a way that we could, you know, swap in some other component.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.220
So, you know, what do you think about this?

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:56.180
Like, just listening to you guys talk, one of the ideas that was running through my mind is, Eric, I like your idea of having a private read the docs.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:03.420
One of the ideas on PyPI that was coming to mind is, well, what if you could have like a premium listing?

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:07.420
So, like, I use Stripe and I pip install Stripe.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.780
And that comes down from there.

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.580
But that's, you know, Stripe is a very successful business.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:16.000
I'm just grabbing an example of something I use that's for pay, basically, right?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:30.920
What if Stripe could have like a premium listing on PyPI and all of the bandwidth and all the hosting charges for the premium listings were not passed through to like Rackspace and Fastly and stuff?

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.160
That could be doable.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:44.080
We'd have to essentially stand up almost a second PyPI to handle that just because there's no real way to discriminate between, you know, different packages where they go through.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.700
I mean, the package files themselves could easily be hosted through another mechanism.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:59.460
But the repository API, the web UI, all that stuff would still have to actually go through, you know, Fastly and then Rackspace and the various companies.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:05.060
So it would be hard to completely separate them without making them two entirely separate entities.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:05.780
Okay.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:13.660
Carol, what are your thoughts on ways that we might be able to mix things up a bit here?

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.700
Looking in from the outside, Eric and Donald are, you know, living this day to day, right?

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.120
Yeah, I mean, I think it's one of those things.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:39.540
I think it's sort of a slippery slope, because if you did do the like sort of like extra like per company or whatever, PyPI, you kind of open the door for losing the huge benefit of PyPI, which is everybody sort of goes to the same place.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.160
We've seen it in science and data science.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:50.360
There's some great stuff that came out of Conda and now more so Conda Forge along with PyPI.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:56.080
But it also kind of increased the burden of, okay, how do we install things?

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.200
Do we use PIP?

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.040
Do we use Conda?

00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:58.800
Yeah.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:04.300
I'm not sure that additional complexity is something that really benefits our users.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.100
Whereas, hey, this is where we go.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:07.700
Yeah.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.360
Easy decision.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.980
One of the things I wonder is if we couldn't use like PIP.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:19.340
Donald's done such a great job of improving it with little readouts as your thing progresses.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:30.820
And even something as basic as, did you know, pip installs X number of terabytes of whatever data in a month or whatever, or whether that's on the PyPI site.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:37.860
But just building awareness, because I think it's going to be a combination of donations that you're going to get.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:49.800
You're going to get some individual donors that give to things like Read the Docs or PyPI or infrastructure because they see the value in it and they use it in their jobs every day.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:56.820
And it might not be what I develop every day, but I use it so much and I would hate to have it go away.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:05.480
So, you know, personally donating to the packaging and to Read the Docs for me was a no brainer.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.640
But I'm in a position where I can do that.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.360
Not everybody can.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:18.100
So, you know, we don't want to set up like a tiered structure to make people feel bad for giving what they can.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:18.540
Yeah.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.580
And where they can.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.420
But I could see, well, a couple of things.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:42.300
One is Eva and the board and the greater PSF team has really worked hard the last year and a half to really level up the governance of PSF and to really look critically at what nonprofits are doing and how we can increase sustainability.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:55.920
And I think some of the first steps that got put in place was to make some strategic hires to support Eva and the sustainability in different areas of the foundation.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:07.780
And now it's really a matter of, okay, the next phase is really, okay, let's take a critical look at all of these things and come up with some best practices and plans.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.260
Just like we do in development.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:17.160
Like, you know, we run things through continuous testing or integration and, you know, to work smarter, not harder.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.060
Yeah, exactly.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:29.020
Like leveraging, like you said, continuous deployment maybe to make sure that if something goes down, it's like a push button to create a new instance of it rather than a scramble for four days.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.420
Something like this, right?

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:30.960
Right.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:49.520
So my feeling is I would much prefer to see the big corporate companies that are really benefiting from Python somehow have a way to fund it but feel like they're getting something a lot out of it, right?

00:43:49.520 --> 00:44:08.040
Like that's kind of why I brought up the premium PyPI package where maybe like if you are a company and the PyPI package is about a thing that is really important to you, maybe somehow that listing could look different and they could pay for it but be really happy to do so, you know, or something similarly on read the docs.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:19.500
I'm not really sure but I feel like the donations are great and I've given some money to PyPI but I don't feel like any amount of money that I can personally give is going to come anywhere near me.

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.300
Near what?

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:31.360
Microsoft, Red Hat, these other companies that have tons of money, Google, if they're making such big use of it and actually have a product on the other end.

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.120
I don't know.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.620
Eva, what do you think?

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:41.160
So I sometimes find myself persuading people that open source needs money and that not everything can be handled by the community and volunteers.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:49.360
I even remember when I was hired, it was a taboo for me to get paid to work for the PSF.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.560
Because everyone was of the mindset that everything should be done by the community.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.640
But I definitely agree that corporate sponsorship is where it's at.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:05.980
And I feel that more corporations need to become aware of the fact that maintaining a software language has multiple angles.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:09.140
A lot of those angles require funding.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:13.860
Corporations that use Python should financially support Python in my opinion.

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:19.880
And these companies are sometimes making millions and millions or billions of dollars on this stuff.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:31.580
And if they cave 0.0001% of that revenue to the thing that their business is based on, it would transform it and be like nothing in their space, right?

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:32.100
Exactly.

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:41.120
And since Python is a core of what they do, I strongly believe that having good infrastructure behind the language is vital for the sustainability of that language.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:46.180
I mean, especially nowadays, there are so many options for programming languages.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:52.860
And we just have to increase the number of reasons we give our developers to stay in order to make Python sustainable for the long run.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.860
I mean, a little bit goes a long way.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.200
I totally agree with you, Eva.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.460
Eric, what do you think?

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.280
100% behind a corporation's paying.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:09.120
I mean, I think depending on Carol giving money to read the docs each month is very much similar to requiring her to pay us, right?

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.160
Like, we would never require open source people to pay us.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:20.900
And asking that the people working on open source pay money to support the infrastructure while companies free ride, it just feels morally wrong to me.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.980
You know, Carol is contributing enough.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.880
She doesn't need to give us money.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.860
And people that are individuals do not need to give us money.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:35.660
And I've actually toyed with removing the ability to give individual donations from read the docs because I think it's a false flag.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.120
Like, it's never going to solve the problem.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.560
And the only people that are going to donate are already giving their time.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.380
And asking them to give money as well is just, it makes me sad.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.740
It does help, but it's like a small band-aid.

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.640
It doesn't really solve the sustainability problem, right?

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.940
I think it distracts, right?

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:52.180
Yeah.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.000
Like, people are like, oh, you just need to get more donations from individuals.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.840
And it's like, that's not the solution.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.620
Please stop suggesting that as the solution.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.560
And I'd be remiss not to mention a couple things here.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:10.180
So Nadia Eggbolt, I believe is her last name, did an amazing job for the Ford Foundation doing a report on this that's like 100 pages.

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.200
And she talked a bunch about Python stuff.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.660
She talked to myself, Keith McGee, a bunch of other people.

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.020
I think Donald as well, for sure.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.480
About these problems.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.340
And I think that is a very concrete report.

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:25.060
And it really does talk about a lot of the different solutions that have been tried.

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:32.780
I think especially with PyPI and kind of the pip example you cited, doing a kind of Wikipedia-style awareness campaign, right?

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:37.780
So if you put in the pip install logs for a week, like, hey, donate to PIP.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:38.840
This stuff is not free.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.700
We're run by a nonprofit.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.740
You know, very similar to how you see at the top of Wikipedia, right?

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:46.620
Like, they really have to, like, push and be heard.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:51.580
And I think there's still a huge number of people that can kind of claim ignorance of this issue.

00:47:51.580 --> 00:48:05.420
And I think if you start putting that on every PyPI page or PyPI page, every read the docs page, every pip install, that would actually start to move the needle in terms of awareness and community, kind of galvanizing a community.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:14.920
And so I think something similar to what Ruby is doing with the Ruby Together efforts, where they're actually kind of they've taken their kind of core infrastructure.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:26.780
They've built some branding around improving it and then kind of showing results either kind of think monthly with those kind of people has been a really interesting thing.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.460
They're still nowhere near where they should be in terms of funding.

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:51.860
But I think if we kind of took, you know, PyPI, read the docs, even just those two, really, and, you know, in PIP, even, for example, and we're like, hey, let's run a one week or a one month campaign, you know, maybe around PyCon, for example, or like, you know, the week up and after PyCon or something where it's like, hey, like, your infrastructure, you know, tie it with a keynote at PyCon U.S.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.960
Tie it with, you know, these massive things where everyone during the sprints is going to see this.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.000
Everyone at their work is going to see this.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:07.920
You know, I think I think we've been very coy about this because it's something that we're kind of we feel awkward about money and open source has been this taboo subject for a long time.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:15.740
But I really do think that we're now at the point where we really have to kind of build sustainable solutions that bring the community in.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:24.800
And so I think that's kind of my my big picture idea is really that kind of I view read the docs at its core like a library, similar to the government stuff we were talking about earlier.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:24.980
Right.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:36.900
We should be funded by taxpayers, you know, and if we're not able to, you know, one of the other things I thought about is going to VCs and doing, you know, a 1% for open source or something along those lines.

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:43.560
You know, I think the things that the green movement and kind of the environmental people are dealing with are very similar.

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:43.860
Right.

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.320
Where there are these externalities that people don't feel.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:50.060
It's a really interesting angle to think of it as this is an externality.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:50.840
Right.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:58.860
This is an expense that people that use open source don't have to pay because it's somehow covered.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:05.340
And basically, a lot of it is pushed on to the companies that donate like Rackspace and Fastly.

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:06.000
Right.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:07.400
They're covering the cost of all this.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.420
So all the other companies in the world can go make money and not worry about it.

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:12.140
Right.

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:12.480
Right.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:17.380
Like open source contributors burning out is the global warming of the technology industry.

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:17.660
Right.

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:18.020
Right.

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:28.460
Because I think there's something really special about the volunteer effort and how people are putting forward all this effort for nothing but to bring some project to fruition.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:45.020
But at the same time, when you see billions of dollars being made by for profit companies on top of this infrastructure and on top of this, these projects, it seems like there's got to be a way that they're not crushing the people trying to do the work, you know, with their weight.

00:50:45.020 --> 00:51:04.820
This portion of Talk Python to me is brought to you by GoCD from ThoughtWorks.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:09.500
GoCD is the on-premise, open source, continuous delivery server.

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:16.300
With GoCD's comprehensive pipeline model, you can model complex workflows for multiple teams with ease.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:22.120
And GoCD's value stream map lets you track changes from commit to deployment at a glance.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:27.120
GoCD's real power is in the visibility it provides over your end-to-end workflow.

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:32.080
You get complete control of and visibility into your deployments across multiple teams.

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:36.560
Say goodbye to release day panic and hello to consistent, predictable deliveries.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.460
Commercial support and enterprise add-ons, including disaster recovery, are available.

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:47.420
To learn more about GoCD, visit talkpython.fm/gocd for a free download.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.720
That's talkpython.fm/gocd.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.820
Check them out.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:52.840
It helps support the show.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:52:01.620
Donald?

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:06.620
Well, yeah, and, you know, it's interesting in a way because I don't want to name names or anything,

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:15.920
but if you go through many, most, you know, sort of web services companies that have some sort of API client that, you know, is available on Python,

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:22.920
you'll see, you know, typically you'll see, you'll see, you'll see, you'll see, pip install, you know, my whole library for that company.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:30.120
So, you know, those companies do tend to drive a lot of traffic towards PyPI, which, you know, increases our costs.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.840
And they sort of get that for free.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:40.880
Now, we're happy to provide that for free, but, you know, they do impact our bottom line to a large degree.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:47.700
I really think that the best sort of end case is for these companies to give back.

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:56.720
You know, I worry about, like, the Wikipedia style, the donation drive and such, in that we're going to end up just getting money from developers.

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:02.160
Again, someone who goes to PyPI online is likely going to be a developer looking for a library.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:06.440
Someone who takes pip install on their command line is likely to be a developer.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:12.400
You know, and the hope there, I guess, is that they will funnel that up towards their management chains.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.240
Say, hey, we depend on this thing.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.180
Can we give it money?

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:22.040
But I worry that the most likely case is that they will maybe give some money themselves and it just kind of ends there.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:28.200
I'm not necessarily sort of super skilled at the donation side of things.

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.040
You know, I reach out to companies and beg them for services.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:44.000
But, you know, I feel like identifying which companies are big Python users and then reaching out to them and asking them for donations is probably going to be our best bet.

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:51.800
And in many ways, PyPI is lucky because we do have the, you know, we're owned by the PSF.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.860
So there's already, you know, a infrastructure set up to get donations.

00:53:55.860 --> 00:54:02.040
And, you know, we're likely, as far as PyPI is concerned, best of trying to improve upon that.

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:10.480
I think that there is actually a path forward where everybody wins, where Python open source infrastructure is funded and supported better.

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:15.960
It's not all the eggs in one basket, even though thank you, thank you, Rackspace and Fastly and so on.

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:23.860
And these companies, like you said, the biggest ones that drive the most traffic, they feel like somehow some change has been made.

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.340
So they actually get better visibility.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.100
They get better.

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:33.480
Their thing that they have a Python library for is doing better with Python developers because of it.

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.640
I don't know.

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.860
I just, the ad model may work somehow.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:47.520
The donation model, while really appreciated, I know, is it's not really enough to sustain, like, a person working all the time or, like, you know, the cost of a lot of times.

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.720
It feels more like there's the yearly drive.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:55.640
So, you know, we're kind of getting near the end of our time, but do we have a solution?

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:59.560
I'm not sure we found any solutions, but I feel like we've started an interesting discussion.

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:04.100
Eva, what's the PFS story here?

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.820
Like, what do you think?

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:15.000
For the PSF, I definitely have short-term goals, which I guess is the best solution I can come up with at this time.

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:21.020
I mean, we've been talking about trying to maybe get traffic statistics that are more targeted.

00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:24.520
Say, hey, this is how your team's using this infrastructure.

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:39.860
And I'm not quite sure if anything beyond them benefiting from it should be a part of the reward for sponsorship because they're already getting a lot from just using it for free.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:48.960
So maybe that's just it, just showing them this is how exactly your team is benefiting from Python and the infrastructure.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.340
It would be great if you can give back.

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:56.700
I mean, it's not like every sponsor has to give us $30,000, $50,000 a year.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:08.140
If all corporate sponsors that use Python give a little every year, I think that could add up to hiring two developers.

00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:22.640
I mean, within the PSF, I want to have an environment where my staff, my team is not worried about how long is my job here for because it's pending on some kind of funding.

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:26.680
I want to make sure that I can pay someone at least five years before I hire them.

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.900
So just taking steps like that.

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:29.300
Okay.

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:29.500
Yeah.

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:32.080
I think on one hand, you know, it is a big problem.

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:37.900
But on the other, like you said, Eva, it's just if people, people, by people, I mean companies.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:42.540
If companies gave a little, it would solve it straight away, right?

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:55.740
I still feel like having some kind of business model that is doesn't seem incongruent with open source and the whole story, but does does bring in a little bit of stability would be a good thing.

00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:00.840
Carol, what do you think coming from like a Jupyter scientific person perspective?

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:02.840
I've got two major thoughts.

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:07.660
One is I would highly encourage folks in the Jupyter data science world.

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:22.540
If you're looking for a great project to do analytics on, approach us because there may be a project that you can look at to analyze the traffic data and, you know, see who's using it, who's consuming it.

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:27.520
And really help us out with the analytics side of things and the reporting side of things.

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:37.080
And then the other thing I think is I had the pleasure of attending an open source sustainability thing with Nadia Agbel earlier this year that O'Reilly put on.

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:42.480
And she and I come from both business background as well as nonprofit.

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:55.260
And I think Eric kind of hit on one group of donors that benefit a lot from open source yet don't directly donate a whole lot to it.

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:56.860
And that is the venture capitalists.

00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:08.260
And if you took the top 20 venture capitalists and they donated 10, 25,000 to sustain the community, it would go a long way.

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:25.640
And I think that may be another area that we look a little closer at and say, okay, you're funding hackathons and giving money away to potentially promising companies down the road that may or may not make it out of their first year of life.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:32.020
But we know that the Python Foundation has been around for a long time.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:41.840
We know that Python's been around for a long time and perhaps go back to them and say, hey, you need to support the infrastructure that you are directly benefiting from.

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.180
Yeah, that's an interesting point.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.840
And VCs were on my mind as well.

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.500
And these high growth companies.

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:58.220
One of the things that came to mind when you were saying this, what if there was some kind of PSF funded or officially funded expert, a group of experts that could come in?

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:02.240
So instead of just going to the VCs saying, look, you have these startups and these accelerators.

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:05.840
And because you benefit from this, you should donate to us.

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:14.980
But because you benefit from us, if you donate to us, we'll actually help your companies get started by giving you 10 hours a week of expert advice.

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:20.020
And obviously, that would have to more than cover that expert's time and energy and so on.

00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.380
But maybe there's some kind of partnership.

00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:22.240
Who knows?

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.840
Donald, final thought.

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.000
Where do we go from here?

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:35.040
I think right now, PyPI is a relatively okay place as far as our hosting infrastructure goes.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:41.380
Our donors have been fairly stable and we've done a pretty good job at diversifying them.

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:45.960
It is always scary that one of them could drop out and how we would handle that.

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:57.560
Looking forward, I do think that the best way to look at this is how to get your corporations, VCs, etc., to sort of contribute back.

00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:01.860
And that's kind of where I'm at.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:02.240
Okay.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.680
Good to hear PyPI is not just about to vanish or anything.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:12.400
But still, it needs a much more stable base, I think, given its vast importance.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.980
Eric, final thoughts?

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:16.200
I think the last thing I said were probably my final thoughts.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.300
All right.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:17.560
Great.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:22.880
I mean, I think, yeah, I'm obviously very much, you know, I think I have personal stake in this.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:30.620
And, you know, I think everyone else here is paid, you know, or until recently has been paid full time in some fashion to work on this.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:34.660
Whereas I have been watching my bank account dwindle trying to solve this problem.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:36.960
And so I think that's why it's a little bit more personal for me.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.540
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.360
And why I have a little bit of, you know, passion, maybe.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.060
Well, you had some really interesting points.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.940
And, you know, I can definitely share some thoughts with you.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:56.920
Like, in February, I went full time on having just my podcast be my 100% income and the training courses that I built on top of it.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:06.880
And it's not open source exactly, but it's, you know, it's working in the open source community to, you know, pay my kids' school bills and mortgage and stuff.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.800
And it's stressful.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:13.160
And I don't have exactly the same constraints because I kind of live alongside open source, right?

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.460
Like, I can do ads.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:18.740
And people, I think, understand for the most part, like, this is paying my bills.

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:19.860
So it's okay.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.100
We'll listen to a 30-second ad.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.340
But it's a challenge, right?

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:24.200
Yeah, definitely.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:30.260
And I think the biggest thing for me is that, you know, four years ago, this felt like nobody was talking about this.

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:33.360
And I really do think that the awareness has just slowly been raised.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:37.960
Because the work that Nadia did was monumental and just kind of the fact we're doing a podcast about it.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.940
And I really think it is more, you know, it's one of those things where we just really do need to keep building awareness.

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.780
Because everyone I talked to was like, oh, read the docs.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.260
I thought that was like a VC-backed company.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.900
Or, you know, it's like we thought.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.540
That's an Eric-backed company.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.840
Exactly, right?

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:58.100
But I think I haven't personally done a great job of raising that awareness and been very skittish about introducing money into this ecosystem.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.000
But I mean, I think at the end of the day, especially for infrastructure, right?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.760
Like, people will happily work on cool new features, like, for fun.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.480
But, like, paying someone to wear a pager is something you have to do.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.020
Like, nobody wants to sign up.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:17.960
And I would feel bad making somebody sign up for free to wear a pager and get woken up at three in the morning to provide a service for free to corporations.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:24.120
You know, like, that's just not something that I feel good about in any aspect of it.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.720
And so I think there is a fundamental need of money for a subset of these efforts.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.000
And I think the community is coming around to that.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.940
I think the conversations are happening.

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.560
And I think we're really in a very positive forward path.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.160
And we just need to keep doing it.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:38.680
All right.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.600
Well, I hope that we can somehow bring this up in PyCon this year in June.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:49.040
And maybe some lightning talks, maybe a keynote, hint, hint, hint, nudge, nudge, or some open spaces or something.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.680
But I think it's great these conversations are happening.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.660
And thank you all for being here.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:03:01.160
It was really interesting to brainstorm about what we can do, what the problems are, and what the solutions might be.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.520
Thanks, everyone.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.180
Thank you.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.440
Yeah, thank you.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.800
Thank you so much, Michael.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.580
Yep, thank you.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.500
