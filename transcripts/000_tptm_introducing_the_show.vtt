00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:06.440
Talk Python To Me, episode number zero, recorded Saturday, March 21st, 2015.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:36.380
Hello, and welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.800
The language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.860
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.140
Follow me on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy, and keep up with the show and listen to past

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.020
episodes at talkpythontome.com.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.640
This very short episode is just a small deposit to get this podcast started.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.280
I looked around and I saw that there was really no good Python podcasts anymore.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.080
There used to be, but for some reason they all stopped.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.000
So I decided it's time to take some action and create a podcast for everybody out there

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.940
in the Python community.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.860
So I hope you all enjoy it, and I hope you let me know what you think of the show by contacting

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.120
me.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.340
First, though, I want to let you know we have some fantastic episodes and some brilliant

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.280
guests lined up for the very first set of shows.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.420
One of the first guests is going to be Mike Bayer, who is the creator and maintainer of SQL

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.860
Alchemy.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.480
SQLAlchemy is a really fantastic ORM that lets you talk to all sorts of relational databases.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.320
On the other side, maybe we want to talk about NoSQL and non-relational databases.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.800
So we're going to have Jesse Davis from MongoDB on our show as well.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.800
And Jesse is the maintainer and the author of PyMongo, the PyMongo driver, as well as a ton

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.260
of other amazing Python open source projects.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.960
So we're going to talk to Jesse about Python, about MongoDB, maybe even some asyncio.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.080
We're also going to talk about web services.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.700
We're going to focus on EVE, which is an open source REST API.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.860
And we're going to talk to Nikola Hiroshi about EVE.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.840
Should be a fascinating conversation.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.380
Well, I hope you're looking forward to these conversations as much as I am.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.200

next, things like that.

And I will see you all online.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.280
Smicks, take us out of here.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.960
Stating with my voice.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.740
There's no norm that I can feel within.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.960
Haven't been sleeping.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.600
I've been using lots of rest.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.440
I'll pass the mic back to who rocked his best.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:21.040
I'm first a ballot first.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.520
developers, developers, developers, developers.
