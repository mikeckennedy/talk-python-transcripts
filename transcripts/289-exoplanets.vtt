00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.260
When I saw the headline, Machine Learning Algorithm Confirms 50 New Exoplanets in Historic First,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.740
I knew that Python must be operating somewhere in the background, and that the story must be told.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.460
That's how this episode was born. Join David Armstrong and Jeff Gamper as they tell us how

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.240
they use Python machine learning to discover not one, but 50 new exoplanets in pre-existing

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.920
Kepler satellite data. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 289, recorded September 29th, 2020.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.700
welcome to Talk Python to Me. Yeah, thanks for having us. Yeah, thanks for having us.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.220
Yeah, it's good to have you guys here. You know, when I saw this article, its title was something like,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.320
Machine Learning Algorithm Confirms 50 New Exoplanets, a Historic First. It didn't say

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.840
anything about Python, but I'm like, I got to contact these guys and find out the story because I bet you

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.680
Python has evolved. And oh my gosh, what an amazing discovery.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.540
And Python's all over astrophysics at the moment. I mean, almost everyone uses it.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.740
So good chance, I think.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.860
Yeah, exactly. I thought, okay, machine learning and astrophysics combined. This has to be Python.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.680
So I reached out to you guys and I'm really excited to have you on the show to talk about the research

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.120
that you're doing, some of the discoveries that you've made. And it sounds also like this is kind

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.680
of the beginning of the stories where things are going. Yeah. So this was really a test case we

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.600
wanted to put together to build up for a load of big missions that are coming online soon. I mean,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.960
you might've heard of the Kepler satellite before, but it's been around for a while,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.760
but it's the biggest data set we have for these exoplanet sort of transits, I guess we'll talk

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.200
about in a bit, but it's a perfect test case to work with.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.960
Yeah, that's awesome. And it's, it's so amazing. You found all these planets as a small test case,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.260
but Kepler starting to near the end of its life, right?

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.760
Kepler stopped recording already. So the main mission stopped in 2013 and it had an extension

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.560
called K2 that went on for a bit longer than that. Yeah. But the data is still full of things to

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.500
discover, as you can see. Amazing. All right, before we get too far into the topics though,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.940
let's just set the stage really quickly with each of your stories. How'd you get into programming in

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.160
Python? Would you like to start David or should I go ahead? Sure. I mean, I got into programming

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.460
with God, it's, it's like college education here, what you call an A-level in computer science

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.720
with learning Pascal, if you believe it. Yeah. So it's going back a fair way, right?

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.420
But now I got into Python while I was doing my undergrad degree. And then mostly when I started

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.480
doing a PhD in astrophysics, because back then it was kind of either Python or IDL. You basically

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.120
picked one when you started. I think Python's won the war now, but yeah, I think so as well. I mean,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.760
I haven't done any IDO, but there was this sort of domain specific programming language for astronomy

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.560
called IDO, right? Yeah, but it's proprietary and you have to pay a fee for it. And I think that's

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.680
what killed it in the end, but it's not killed. There's still people that use it, but the numbers

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.820
are shrinking. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Jeff, how about you? So I also got started with Python during my

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.580
undergrad. At that time, I was very much interested in quantitative finance and qualitative trading.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.700
Not interested in that anymore for a long time and wrote my undergrad thesis with Python and R.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.500
And then I came to Warwick to do my master's, met David and Theo. Theo is another co-author on the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.220
paper. And there was this master's project to do exoplanet detection and validation with Python and

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.600
machine learning. So I just jumped on it and got started. And that was kind of the second project

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.740
with Python. Yeah, that sounds really fun. I got into programming as programming in general,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.380
into C++, because I had to learn enough programming for a math research project. And it's funny how these

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.140
things sort of take you down paths that you don't necessarily expect them to take you. Like,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.980
oh, I'm kind of interested in this project. I guess I got to learn that. Wait, now that's my job or

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.700
that's my specialty. How'd that happen? Yeah, exactly. I mean, that has been the case for me. It's been

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.400
quantitative trading, then astronomy, and then PhD in medical imaging, which is all Python.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.520
Yeah, absolutely. Especially the ML side of the medical imaging analysis, for sure. So how about

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.600
what you're up to day to day? What do you do these days?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.640
So nowadays, I'm towards the end of my PhD in medical imaging, which mostly involves all things

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.280
Python, PyTorch, deep learning, computer vision, networks, all these sort of things. And I also

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.820
work as a senior scientist at a startup in London, where mostly we work with climate models, but also

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.920
remote sensing. So there's quite a bit of machine learning there as well, where computer vision on

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.340
remote sensing images and also fitting neural nets to climate data. So that's the stuff today.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.140
How interesting. I think one of the cool takeaways, or it seems like you could infer from that is

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.800
you're using this skill you have with Python to do all these different things, right? Like

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.160
quantitative trading, climatology, and astrophysics. Like those are not typically a common skill set.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.340
I mean, the common things in all those things, it's programming, being able to code. And Python is

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.780
a good language to start for everyone and has very kind of big community around it, where most of the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.880
tools that you will need on your day to day basis for day to day tasks are already well developed and

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.840
well maintained. So that's really kind of what makes Python really cool for that.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.700
Absolutely. David, how about you?

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.240
Well, Stack Overflow, of course.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.440
Of course. You can always copy and paste that little segment to make it do something.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.280
Who knows what?

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.900
Yeah, I mean, so I'm a lecturer at the University of Warwick in the physics department. So most of my

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.020
days, well, bits of research and teaching, writing grant proposals, supervising students,

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.260
this kind of thing. I mean, there's more and more of the later ones and less and less of the research,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.180
but I think that's how it goes.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.740
Yeah, absolutely. That is how it goes. Cool. Cool, cool. I think being in academics is just

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.860
really fun. You get to explore so many amazing ideas and you're not rushed, right? It's not like

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.120
you've got a six week sprint to write this code and then move on to the next thing.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.520
Yeah, you can really think things through and try and work out what you're doing. I mean,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.600
there's always something to do, right? It's a different kind of rush,

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:20.180
but nothing like industry, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Well, as a PhD student, I'd like to speak here.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.880
Well, sometimes you do have to rush if you have a deadline and your supervisor is behind you telling

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.380
you, no, you got to do this. You got to submit your paper there. So yeah. Yeah. I was in grad school

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.580
for a while and there's this guy, he was just, everybody knew him. He was working on his PhD and

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.080
he had been around for nine years in the PhD program. And he just, you could tell he was just

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.040
meant to be at a university. Wonderful guy, but he had no, it was just no urgency for him to finish

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.200
his degree and get going until they said, you know, there's a 10 year limit in this program. And if you

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.460
don't finish within 10 years, you don't get your PhD. He's like, oh my gosh, he was done in six months.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.540
Well, 10 years as well. That's a lot of time.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.640
Yeah. He just chilled. He just loved it. Like, I don't know. It was easy living, I guess.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.880
All right. So let's talk about astronomy and Python. Now in this article, there's the official

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.660
research paper that you guys put out. And then there was top side type articles. And in that one,

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:20.120
the one from, I think it was the tech Republic, it said now astronomers are using machine learning

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.820
algorithms to search for planets beyond our solar system, formerly known as exoplanets. Is there a

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.020
different name? Am I missing something or are they off here? There are still planets, but we just call

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.980
planets outside the solar system, extrasolar planets, kind of just an exoplanets for short.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.080
Extra solar. Yeah. Okay. I don't know if it's a formal name in the same way,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.360
but exoplanets is what they've been called in the literature for a few years now. So.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.620
Yeah. Okay. That's what I thought too. You know, they're not wrong. They're not wrong.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.500
Super. All right. So when was the first exoplanet discovered?

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.500
There's a bit of a argument about some of the details, but it's roughly 20 years ago,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.420
1995, I think for some of the first discoveries. I mean, there's been, there were a few candidates

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.840
before them, but it was back and forth in the literature for a while.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:06.460
Right. I feel like this was done by a couple of astronomers in the observatory in Hawaii.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.900
And so this was a ground-based discovery originally, right?

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.680
Yeah. The two astronomers were based in Geneva, actually. It was Michelle Mayor and Didier Kelo.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.080
Okay.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.920
And they got the Nobel prize for it last year. Right. And then.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.860
Oh, wow. Okay.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.020
Yeah. So that was the first one discovered. I mean, since then we've gone up over about 4,000

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.060
now and it goes up every day. I mean, it's just been accelerating rapidly.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:31.320
Yeah. So we've always thought solar system setup that we have, this cannot be unique,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.840
but we didn't have any proof of it. And so now, like you said, we do. And a lot of the data that

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.660
people are analyzing must be coming from Kepler these days, right? So maybe tell us,

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.840
maybe we start with the story of Kepler.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.700
So Kepler launched in 2009. It was active in the, what we call the primary mission for four years.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.580
And it just stared at one patch of the sky, like a fairly large bit, but still just one

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.800
patch for those straight four years, taking measurements of how bright the stars were every

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.020
half an hour, about 200,000 stars. And that's what really revolutionized the field in terms

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.740
of the statistics. I mean, we went from having sort of hundreds of planets that we knew about

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.180
to having thousands. And it was the first one that could really find planets that were a bit

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.520
closer to being like the earth, even if they were usually much hotter than the earth.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:08.840
Right.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.620
The ones we found.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:15.260
Right. Because a lot of the discoveries early had to do with planets that were both very close

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.840
to the stars. So the pulsing was frequent and very large because, so it was extreme,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.420
right? Like a hot Jupyter type of thing.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.040
Yeah, that's right. And those hot Jupyters were fascinating at the time. I mean, no one expected

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.660
them to exist at all until they started finding them.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:28.880
Yeah.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.440
Really interesting stuff. But of course you want to find planets that are closer to the earth,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.440
right? That's what everyone's got in their mind. So you're always trying to push that boundary

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:35.880
out of it.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:42.820
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So we had Kepler and you said that shut down in 2013 and other ones must be coming

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.840
in a line. Yeah. So Kepler, they actually...

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.300
The excitement around this can't have gone down, right? With the discoveries being made.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.700
No, no, of course not. Like, so Kepler, they actually, what happened is it had these reaction

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.140
wheels in the satellite and too many of them broke. So they ended up not being able to stabilize it very

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.280
well. And they sort of repurposed it by this very clever technique of kind of balancing it off the

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.400
wind from the sun. But I don't want to go into that. But it was called K2 for a bit longer and

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.960
carried on for a bit. But that's finished now as well. Eventually it ran out of fuel. But now the one

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.520
that's active that everyone's looking at is called TESS. There's another NASA mission that's,

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.740
again, observing stars, trying to look for planets transiting, like measuring the brightness of the

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.940
stars, but doing it in a very different way. So it looks at almost the entire sky. And that's been up

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.800
for about two years now and it's still going on.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:31.080
Wow. Okay. Maybe give us a little background on how this works. So it's not visual, right? They don't

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.100
see the planets.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.500
No, much as we'd like to.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.720
They measure... Wouldn't that be amazing? You're like, oh, look, it's a water world.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.200
No, it's measuring the effects of a planet on the star, right?

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.460
Yeah. So the way we were looking at it is called the transit method. It's found most of the planets

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.640
to date so far, though that might change going forward. I mean, it's when, if you imagine a

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.040
planet going around the star, if everything lines up absolutely perfectly, sometimes the planet passes

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.060
between us and the star or between the telescope and the star. And that's going to block out a tiny

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.980
little bit of the light from the planet, from the star.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.460
Like a little, almost like an eclipse.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.860
Yeah, it is an eclipse. I mean, we call them transits because they're planets, but it's called

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.820
eclipses if you have a star instead. And it's a very small fraction. I mean, those hot Jupyters

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.600
we talked about drop out about a percent of the star's light, but something like the Earth,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.740
it's more very small fractions of a percent. Parts per million we usually end up talking about.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.860
And so we're trying to measure the brightness of the stars and look for these dips in the light.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.220
And if you see them in a sort of regular pattern with the right kind of shape and lots of other

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.240
things, you can say it's a planet.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.900
Yeah. There was also the wobble method.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.300
Yeah. Do you want to do it yet?

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.600
Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. I mean, with the wobbler effect, it's mostly, again, it's an indirect

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.640
observation method for detecting the planets orbiting the star. And it's mostly based on

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:45.840
the sun or the star and the planet having the common center of mass and then kind of going

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:51.000
in an orbit around that common center of mass. And that would make the star wobble. But most of the

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.060
kind of the observation methods for the wobble effect are for the large planets, which we have

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:00.600
been detecting before and for the smaller planets that might not necessarily work, especially for the

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.580
earth-like planets. So that's why transit photometry that is used by the Kepler is a bit better,

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.820
is a lot better to detect earth-like planets. And that's what we're interested in is quantifying

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.680
the frequency of these earth-like planets.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.960
Yeah. Figuring out if anything lives there is one thing, but finding them is the first step,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.340
right? And the closer, the better.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.860
Yes. You got to start somewhere.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:26.660
Exactly. So this used to be done by hand or maybe studying one-off, like let's look at this one star.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:31.340
Maybe you guys give us the background on how this was done before and then some of the techniques that

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.000
you brought in with Python here.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.460
So previously, people would still survey lots of stars. They'd try and observe loads of them and

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.400
try and find the ones that had these transits around them. But you'd kind of identify candidates

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.700
automatically. And then once you have those candidates, you'd have to look through the ball and

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.280
basically say, okay, this one's false because it's clearly, you know, the telescopes jumped out here

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.360
or something like that. And, you know, people would go through this and you'd have large teams of often

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.300
PhD students looking at these candidates for a while. You know, it wasn't really a great use of people's

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.300
time. You got very familiar with the data, right? And that's kind of okay. You know, that only works for

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.860
so long. So yeah.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:10.280
Yeah. You study all the science, you go to school for seven, eight years with your undergrad, and you're

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.020
just looking for variations, like common variations, right?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.800
I mean, there's a lot of science that's like that one way or another, right?

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.860
I know. Yeah.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:22.520
I mean, I know people who sat in fields, basically watching swallows flying and measuring like how

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.180
often they did it and when for days upon days upon days. And it's kind of nice to be outside,

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.140
right? That one's not so bad. But, you know, there's a lot of data taking, right?

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:30.500
Yeah.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.940
But anyway, the more we can automate that, the better, really. I mean, not only because you don't want

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.220
people to have to spend all their time doing that kind of thing, but because if you're trying to do

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.220
statistics with it, you really don't want human biases coming into it.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.040
Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.240
Like some of the earliest things, I don't want to name any names or surveys here, but we could start,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.280
I think you could see a frequency in how often people flagged candidates as potential planets

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.360
based on when the coffee breaks were. So there was a peak after coffee breaks and lunch, right?

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.320
And, you know, that's fine if you find all of them.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:04.060
Exactly. And yeah, we talked about this previously. This is super interesting that human bias, not even

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:09.480
bias in the traditional sense, but just like moods and stuff would affect it. You know, you've had your

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:16.420
afternoon coffee and cake or cookies or whatever. And so now you're a little more focused, a little

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:21.740
happier and, oh yeah, that probably is a planet. Yeah. You're a little less pessimistic. Yeah.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.840
Yeah. So you flag a few more things, right? Yeah.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:29.260
That actually becomes really important if you work in medical imaging, because there it's not just

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:35.780
one PhD student looking at a particular light curve of a planet. Here you have multiple doctors looking

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:40.260
at the same image and all of them have different idea of what is happening in that image. And then

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.140
try to figure out what is the truth kind of thing.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.780
How interesting. And of course it has a way more serious consequences, right? If there's hundreds

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.540
of thousands of planets out there and we miss one, well, yeah, maybe it'll even be found later.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.960
But if you're trying to determine, do you need treatment for cancer? Yes or no? And they're like,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:00.800
eh, no. Or yes, or whatever, right? That is a serious knock-on effect. All right. So you talked

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.740
about this light curve. Yeah. Tell us, maybe describe the data that you're looking at, because if you're

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.880
doing, say, this cancer research and having machines look at that, that's like a mammogram

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.280
or something along those lines. But this is not a picture in the traditional sense that you're

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.780
analyzing with this study, right? Yeah. So when I got started on this project as a master student,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.440
I've spent quite a bit of time with David, just asking him loads of questions to understand what

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.500
is the data? What is it that I'm looking at? And how do I even work with it? What am I supposed

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.600
to do with it? Because around the Kepler satellite itself, there's a massive data processing pipeline.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:37.280
First satellite itself naturally looks at the stars, records the brightness of a star over time.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:43.400
Then that data is transitioned to the research center where the data is processed along with the

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.980
information of a kind of engineering information of what was happening on the satellite. And that

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:54.480
together is being post-processed to determine, to kind of get the final light curve or brightness of a

00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:00.740
star. And then that brightness of a star over time is processed continuously to detect new planetary signals

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:07.200
again and again and again and again. And from that, then there are parameters derived on what specific

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.720
orbital period this planet might have, what might be the size of it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And these become

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:18.420
the features that we work with. And I probably missed a whole lot of things already. So David could probably add some

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:18.940
more on that.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:24.700
I mean, I don't want to add too much detail in a big go, right? Fundamentally, though, it's the satellite measuring how bright

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.620
these stars are over time and we have to take pictures with the satellite. So you have like a CCD image like you'd see on a normal

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:34.920
camera, but they have to like identify the stars in that and work out where they are and how bright they are at each

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.740
point and try and turn that into a long time series. But in the end, what we've got is lots of time series data.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:45.700
Right. Once you've narrowed it down to a single star, you're able to just say, what is the brightness of that star over time?

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.720
Yeah. So I mean, and in Kepler's case, most of them, we'd have a measurement every 30 minutes and that would carry on

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.280
almost continually for about four years. So you're talking around 60,000 data points for each star there.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.160
So it gets quite nice.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.400
Yeah, that's quite a bit of data. One thing is step back a little bit on the science side, I guess.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.420
One thing that just blows my mind about this is the timescale that you're working on here.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.780
If you've got, say, like Mercury or hot Jupyter going around and around really fast, like you get lots of measurements.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:17.480
But if you've got something far out from the star, it could be equivalent to a year, multiple years.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.000
Like that's just a couple of passes, right?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.240
Yeah. And so each pass, you get one transit, right? And if there's fewer than three, it starts to get

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.920
very difficult to say for sure whether it's really a planet you're seeing.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.240
Yeah.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.480
And not just two random blips where the instrument got a bit hot or something.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:30.900
Yeah.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.580
So really, we kind of require that there's at least three in most cases before you'd really claim

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.380
something was a planet. And even that's pushing it.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:37.780
Yeah.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.360
So ideally, you want more than that. And you can see you need to stare for four years just to start

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.500
to get anything like a year.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.300
I know. It's great. Yeah. It's such a large timescale.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.940
In your planets. And this is why, you know, this is why most of the planets we know just

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.840
aren't like the same sort of periods as the Earth. I mean, the vast majority of the planets we know

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.240
actually have periods less than Mercury.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.820
Wow.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.240
So Mercury's, I forget off the top of my head, it's around 80 days, right? Close to that.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.920
Most of the planets we know are sort of sub-20-day periods, even, just because it's easier to find them.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.160
That's flying. Yeah, yeah. That's where you get all the measurements.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.980
But the other ones must be out there, right?

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.140
Yeah. I mean, the indications we have are that planets are everywhere. Very, very common.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.880
And it's just a matter of getting the detection efficiency good enough to find the ones that

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.980
are further out, really, I think.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:21.760
Yeah. David talked about this data, large data, you know, 60,000 measurements for a single star

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.880
and hundreds of thousands of stars. You maybe want to talk about the data processing pipeline

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.100
and how you took this data and worked through it, got it somewhere you guys could analyze?

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:36.780
I mean, the big advantage was that most of the data is already public. So all of the parts of the

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.700
data set, you can access it online on the associated Kepler websites and then do some of the processing

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.820
steps to kind of derive the features that you're interested in. Okay.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:50.080
And also the confirmed planets and confirmed false positives as labels for machine learning are also

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:56.120
available online. So kind of when I was working on the master's project back then, David pointed me in the

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.340
right directions, where do I have to get the labels, where do I have to get the features, and then

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.740
naturally pointed me and directed me in terms of what features are we supposed to derive from that,

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.400
what kind of post-processing is supposed to happen.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.580
And that's where really the advantage of Python comes in and packages like scikit-learn, because

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:16.300
most of these steps are already available in terms of normalizing the features and making the

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.720
machine learning pipelines and making the hyperparameter optimization pipelines. So that's all been kind of

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:27.680
easy to set up. In terms of the features for the data set, there were, I don't know how much into the

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.540
details we want to get, but there are a few features that we computed on top of the features available

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:37.340
with the Kepler satellite, Kepler data processing pipeline, and we naturally did some feature

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.440
importance to determine what do we need, what we don't need.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.140
Yeah, yeah. Tell us about that.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.580
Feature importance. I wouldn't remember which features were important now. In fact, I don't.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.480
I can still remember a few. I've been looking at this more recently, I think, I guess.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.260
I mean, the one that always comes up at the top is the shape of the transit. So when the planet passes in front

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.920
of the star, there's a sort of characteristic shape you get. It's very much like a U kind of shape.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.700
And that tells you a lot. I mean, a lot of the things that can cause kind of false positives.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.480
So what we're trying to do with all of this is work out when we see a candidate, whether it's a real

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.880
planet or whether it comes from something else. Like quite often you get things called eclipsing

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.380
binaries where it's basically just two stars over to each other and you see the eclipse of one of them.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.700
And that can give you a very similar signal that might look a bit like a planet, but isn't actually.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.180
And there's a few other things like that that can cause false positives.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:19.600
Right.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.480
And they tend to have these very slightly subtly different shapes. So sort of narrower eclipses that are a bit more

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.540
V-shaped and so on and things like that. And that always helps us a lot, but it doesn't get every case,

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.380
sadly enough.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.500
If my memory is not too wrong, David, was it also the case that some of the

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.460
uncertainty measurements that were computed by the Kepler satellite pipeline were also computed as

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.280
important features or am I wrong?

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.700
I don't think we used them in the end.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.240
Okay.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.220
But they did go in to start with, but they didn't come out so important when you were doing those tests.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:46.640
Okay.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:58.520
Yeah. I was going to say, I'm no expert at image processing and with machine learning, but it seems to me that these models are very good at detecting small, minute changes that humans often miss.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:05.620
Right. Like it was so successful detecting breast cancer and mammogram scans that a lot of trained professionals actually missed.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:16.400
And these slight variations in like, oh, this is how it is when it's a star with a star rather than a planet and a star is subtle, but somehow machine learning seems to be able to find those and pull them out.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.360
This portion of talk Python to me is brought to you by brilliant.org.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:29.020
Brilliant has digestible courses in topics from the basics of scientific thinking all the way up to high end science like quantum computing.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:34.820
And while quantum computing may sound complicated, brilliant makes complex learning uncomplicated and fun.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.520
It's super easy to get started.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.960
And they've got so many science and math courses to choose from.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.860
I recently used brilliant to get into rocket science for an upcoming episode.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.000
And it was a blast.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.600
The interactive courses are presented in a clean and accessible way.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.380
And you could go from knowing nothing about a topic to having a deep understanding.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.220
Or just click the link in the show notes.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:18.420
I think the best thing here is that like sometimes in the extreme cases, like someone looking at it who was awake and paying proper attention and everything would spot the difference.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.320
But what the machine can do is give you a nice sort of quantified boundary between the two.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.160
And so, you know, this is where you need to draw your line and stuff near it.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.640
Here it falls on this side or this side.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.320
And here's how confident you should be about it, given what we can see.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.520
And it can make all those quantified.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.240
And that's the real benefit, I think.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:37.200
You're not just relying on people sort of keeping themselves the same the whole way through, which no one does, of course.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:47.940
And one of the things I think is probably a challenge here is certainly a challenge in some places is as you look at more of these signals, you get better at identifying those things.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.140
But you weren't good at the first hundred you looked at or whatever, right?

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.740
You've become trained in looking at these type of data.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.880
And so you bring on a new grad student, they go through that similar like learning curve as well.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.900
And you can try and mitigate all that by like getting multiple people to look at every candidate.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.920
But then you're just multiplying up the work hours, right?

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:13.440
In machine learning, they often refer to it as graduate student descent, where you just have multiple graduate students and they iterate on each and every of them.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:13.800
Exactly.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.300
It's like a different form of deep learning.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:15.680
Right.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.060
They can probably still get the wrong minimum, right?

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.640
The wrong optimization.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:29.160
So, Yav, one of the things about this I think it sounds like made it work is you talked about there's already these Kepler data where it's labeled, right?

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.700
These are verified exoplanet signals.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.440
These are verified false positives and these are not exoplanets, right?

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.460
So you were able to leverage that to teach the scikit-learn model?

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.120
Yes.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:50.100
So we took some of the verified planets and some of the verified false positives, took the features, and essentially you create a Pandas data frame that you can feed into the scikit-learn machine learning models.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:55.740
Split them into your cross-validation folds and fit the hyperparameters and see what you get.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.860
All of the metrics to really evaluate the performance of these classifiers are already out there.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.980
It's more the question of how do you interpret them from the understanding of the model.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:19.180
So one interesting thing from what I remember was that the dataset itself seemed quite easy in terms of us getting very high accuracy metrics, but the slight difference between the different classifiers wasn't interesting.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:31.980
So linear discriminant analysis performed slightly better than quadratic discriminant analysis, which meant that the decision boundary between the false positives and the confirmed planets was actually way simpler.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:36.880
And you didn't need a quadratic function to describe what is the difference between them.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.320
So you needed to be careful of not trying to overfit to too many outliers, essentially.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.740
And the clearer the distinction, the better it is for you guys, right?

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.120
Yeah.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.580
And just quantifying how confident we should be about that distinction.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:56.240
I mean, that was a big thing of the improvement we made is trying to get probabilistic output so we could really get a proper probability for whether something was a planet or not.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:56.460
Yeah.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.400
Versus just trying to rank the best ones, which is what people have tried to do before.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:06.540
I understand normal surveys, normal studies, where they have got very basic statistics, right?

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:13.620
Like, how many standard deviations is this from the mean or various other standards, statistical analysis?

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.800
What about this?

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.560
Like, once you've fed that all through machine learning, what you get out the other side, like, how do you make sense of that?

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.040
Oh, God.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.640
So probabilistic machine learning is a huge thing in itself, right?

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.200
Beyond even that.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.120
But there's different ways.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.800
So, I mean, we used multiple different models.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:33.760
One of them that's naturally probabilistic is a Gaussian process classifier, which we built with GPFlow as a different package.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.460
And that actually took a GPU to run, which we thankfully got for free off NVIDIA.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.520
So I should probably say that, you know, they'll be happy.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.620
Awesome.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.440
Yeah, that's cool.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.840
So that sort of naturally gives you a probability of class membership.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:52.400
So you set it up with the whole training seven labels that you have, and it'll tell you what the actual probability that a new sample actually is a member of any one of those classes.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:52.680
Yeah.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.260
But all the other things we have to calibrate.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:26:03.880
So we get some sort of score out of the machine learning model, and then we have to take all of our examples and say, okay, well, we've got a score of 0.6, but actually 80% of these are really planets.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.640
So really, that needs to be 0.8.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.440
And you can kind of calibrate that way, sort of bootstrapping yourself.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:14.900
So do you have people go back through and basically reanalyze what the machine learning suggested, just focusing on those stars?

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:19.900
What was the, once it says, you know, 67% likelihood, what happened?

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:25.280
That's definitely where we had to actually work on calibrating the classifiers that were non-probabilistic.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:39.180
We also wanted to compare it against the probabilities produced by some of the previous methods, like VESPA, which was a physics-based model that evaluates the likelihood of different false positive scenarios and the planetary scenario.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:52.520
And that's where the things got interesting, because the probabilities that our machine learning classifiers were producing versus the probabilities produced by previous models were slightly different, particularly for false positives, if I'm not mistaken.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.880
More than slightly.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.700
I mean, they disagreed in something like 27% of the cases.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:56.980
Yeah.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:03.140
And this is VESPA, I should say, before we get deep into that, is a sort of field standard tool that's like a, it's an actual physical model.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:08.260
So you're fitting models of these different planet and false positive scenarios to the data and trying to say, how well does each model fit?

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:08.680
Right.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.580
From what you understand, does it make sense with the way you think planets and gravity and all that works?

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:13.800
Yeah.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.280
Yeah.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:19.800
Because we can sort of build up a fake system with a binary star and so on and say, okay, well, this is what that data looks like.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.820
And, you know, does it match?

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.240
Does it not?

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:21.700
And so on.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.020
And you can do that properly in a Bayesian way and get some good statistics out of it.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:30.880
The trouble is to make it run fast enough on a large number of samples, because to do this properly is very, very slow.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.020
And VESPA makes some approximations too, and it has a whole set of results.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.560
But till now, it's been the only thing that can run fast enough to really do this on large numbers of candidates.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.220
And so we were the first people to be able to compare against that.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.540
And we actually got some quite big discrepancies, which is kind of worrying, right?

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.060
Oh, wow.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.240
Yeah.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.440
I mean, it's not that it...

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.360
It's both exciting and worrying because somebody's got to change something, right?

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.000
Or learn something.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.540
Yeah.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.100
Yeah.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.560
Well, it's important to do, you know.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.100
So we haven't really got to the root of that yet as to what's causing it.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.380
I mean, but when there was an independent label, it pretty much favored our classifier.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.560
So we're optimistic about that part, at least.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.800
Yeah, that is optimistic.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.200
Yev, do you want to tell us more about this GPFlow library?

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:13.020
So GPFlow was something I briefly worked with when working on this project.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:19.020
At that time, I was quite interested in Gaussian process classifiers and Bayesian nonparametrics.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.100
But also how does it...

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:29.920
The problem with Gaussian processes generally is that they're quite hard to scale because you need to do a matrix inversion to be able to kind of get the posterior.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:43.380
What GPFlow allows you to do is to formulate the whole problem or rather uses the methods that formulate the problem of kind of fitting your Gaussian processes to the problem by formulating this optimization problem.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.440
And that's where the GPUs come in.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.660
And GPFlow is naturally built on TensorFlow, which is built for optimizing parameters on the GPUs.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.520
And that's what GPFlow is, but for Gaussian process specifically.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.800
With a few kind of inference methods already pre-built into the package.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:05.880
And you can just define your Gaussian process, define your kernel, define the hyperparameters, give it your data, and it will do the work for you.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.500
That's what GPFlow essentially is.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:07.980
Yeah.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.320
It basically requires an NVIDIA graphics card underneath.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.160
Well, any decent GPU will help it speed up, right?

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.240
But you can get away without it.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:15.860
It just takes forever.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.120
Yeah.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.200
Yeah.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.900
Nice.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.300
So how about the compute cluster?

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:25.760
You know, I speak, I've had folks from like CERN, Large Hadron Collider.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.280
They've got like this incredible compute cluster that they can send their stuff out.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:35.180
The one kilometer array folks also had this huge amount of data they were processing in a big compute cluster.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:35.800
What about yours?

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:41.900
So back when I started this project, I was doing it all on the laptop that they gave to us as part of the program.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.280
But as David mentioned later on, it was run on a GPU.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.180
So, yeah, it kind of progressed from a tiny laptop that I had to the GPU.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:50.640
Yeah.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.400
Though still, I mean, just one GPU.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.620
We never really got to big computing nodes and clusters.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:59.680
Like, it's not really a processing limited job, I think, at least at the scale we were running it at.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.160
Right.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.080
I think it's really interesting.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:07.580
And that's why I want to kind of tease that out, because it didn't take a huge amount of computing power to do this.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:13.260
All of the non-Gaussian process models, I mean, there's some random forests and multi-layer perceptron things and the like in there.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:21.180
All of them, even by the end when we're running sort of like publication level results, we're still running on a pretty standard iMac, just on a desktop computer.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.100
So it's just not using these big supercomputers, you know.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:24.440
Yeah.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.860
How much of the processing is happening in there?

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:34.040
Is the, do you start from the brightness over time signal or do you start from the actual image of the whole sky, the image of the star?

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.220
Like, where do you begin this analysis?

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:36.740
Yeah.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.080
So this is the good question, right?

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.200
So a lot of the quick analysis I've been talking about is all of the training, the models and so on.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.200
Like a lot of the features were pre-computed by NASA as part of the Kepler pipeline.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.140
And that saves us a lot of processing time.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.400
I mean, it really does.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.180
So you can't really understate.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.520
It's actually a bit more of a processing problem when you try and do that as well.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:54.980
Right.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.080
But it's already been sort of condensed down to you care about the star.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.980
Here's the data.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:59.580
Go look at it.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:30:59.900
Yeah.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.080
So here's a lot of metadata on it.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.820
And we'll still take the time series and we'll calculate some extra things from it, but not at the same level.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.780
So we don't have to start with the sort of real pixel level camera images.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.440
And that takes a long time to process.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:10.960
Yeah.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.000
You talked about Kepler being done, tests coming online.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:24.100
Maybe give us a sense for where this kind of research is going, where like additional projects, additional studies you all might be doing.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:29.600
What does the future look like with new telescopes, larger field of view, more data, so on?

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.360
Well, I mean, with this one, we were really just trying to demonstrate the method on Kepler, but test is where you need it.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.320
I mean, so Kepler has maybe 8,000 candidates, I think, in the database.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:46.020
The yield estimates for tests kind of imply that we're going to find around 20,000 planets on top of several hundred thousand false positives.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.820
So you're already upping it by a couple of orders of magnitude anyway.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.260
Yeah.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.620
That's in a sample of around 20 million light curves.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.680
So it's a much bigger data set all by itself.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.740
And that hasn't really been done yet to this sort of scale.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.260
So really, the next thing we want to do is to generalize this model and apply it to tests.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:31:59.560
Yeah.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.260
And there's future missions coming on.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:06.080
So there's one called PLATO, the European Space Agency mission that's due to launch in a few years.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.340
And while various things coming online, it's a big interesting topic.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.600
So there's lots of stuff in the pipeline.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.240
How long will test run for?

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:19.120
Will you be able to detect things that are further out, like Neptune type of things, or is it still short?

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:23.180
So one of the trade-offs with tests was that it's observing the whole sky.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:28.340
But that means for most of the sky, it observes it for less time, just a month, actually, and for most stars to start with.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:32.380
I mean, the interesting thing about tests, though, is they built it so it has about 10 years of fuel, I think.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.220
Like a lot more fuel than it's currently funded to operate for.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.120
So optimistically, it could be going for the next decade.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.960
We'll figure it out.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.100
If we could get someone to pay attention in the next eight years, we'll just keep it running.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.140
You know, if you're doing well enough, eventually it just sort of pays.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:45.560
Yeah.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.660
It's like Hubble, I guess.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.660
Once you're doing well enough.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.220
Right.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.920
David, I've got a bit of a machine learning question.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.460
Like, how applicable are the models actually built on Kepler to the test satellite?

00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.060
Because from the test satellite, you won't have initial data to start with, right?

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:00.600
Yeah.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:08.460
So this is one of the big challenges of building it for tests is we have to simulate a training set by making models of all the different scenarios and starting to inject them into the time series.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.020
Right.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.360
Because the measurement might be more sensitive.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.720
It might look slightly different.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.100
It's not the same instrument.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.040
And so...

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.100
Different cadence, different noise.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:16.720
Yeah.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.380
All that stuff.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:17.600
Yeah.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.240
For sure.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:27.880
I mean, the advantage of that, though, is we can start to really build up the explainability of it because we can test how things perform on different scenarios and actually just increase the size of our training set hugely.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.400
So there's some advantages, too.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.720
But yeah, it's some work for sure.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.180
Yeah.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.760
You kind of got to go back to restart.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:39.720
You could go find the ones that are verified by Kepler and say, let's look at those, see what the curves look like, line it up.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.200
Yeah.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:40.240
Yeah.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:45.700
And it's a nice thing because you can look at the stars that Kepler observed and Tess observed and say, like, oh, well, we know there's not a planet there.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.060
So this is clearly some kind of noise.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.340
And use that in your training set and this kind of thing.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:49.780
Yeah.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.140
There's some nice little synergies to build in with it.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.040
Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.860
Well, what about other fields?

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:09.380
Can people take this idea of creating these machine learning models, studying the data that was already labeled, and automatically get insight into, I don't know, climate or weather or earthquakes, things like this?

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.600
I mean, of course, machine learning is being used everywhere, right?

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.100
Yeah.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.240
You must have a...

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.860
I mean, I didn't quite understand the question.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.560
If you could repeat, what is it that...

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:23.360
Well, I'm just thinking there must be some inspiration that other fields can take from this who are not yet using machine learning.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.320
Do you see any where it's being underutilized, I guess?

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.080
Obviously, it's been utilized in a lot of places.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.480
Probably plenty of fields.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.600
Like, I can't think of many off the top of my head.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.420
But, I mean, one big field is remote sensing.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.680
There is just so much data observing the Earth's surface.

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.860
And most of it just kind of is there unused.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:47.560
If you think about two satellites, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, most of these satellites are not put to use at all.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.300
But yet they produce terabytes of data.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.520
And we've actually seen that in practice.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.140
But the problem there is that there is very few labels.

00:34:54.140 --> 00:35:00.920
But what you can learn is that actually it's okay to use labels that have been produced by other methods.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:06.180
So the same way that as some of the planets have been confirmed by multiple follow-up observations,

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.340
there is still some likelihood that they could have been wrong.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:19.220
But ultimately, once you put all of that together into one big data set, there will be still some signal from which machine learning can learn what features to use to do the classification.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:25.460
And that way scale up once you have large data sets and slowly, slowly move towards some answer that you're looking for.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.260
Or you might not be looking for an answer.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.900
You just want to see what happens.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:29.480
Yeah.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:35.580
I guess if you start with sort of messy labels and you get a start-off classification, it can tell you which labels are most likely to be messy.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.120
And you can make your training set better, right?

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:37.960
And start iterating.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.500
Yeah.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.660
What about using it for iteration?

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:48.740
I don't know very much about this data, but we could label a few things, see what it detects, go back and pay attention to what it thinks is important and say,

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:53.220
yo, you're right, no, you're wrong, let's retrain you, do it again, and so on.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:53.680
Yeah.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:58.400
So actually, there are quite a few publications in machine learning that look into these kind of problems.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.640
And you can think of it like intuitively, it sounds very much like expectation maximization.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.600
You move your parameters slightly, then you maximize over your data set.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:14.160
And especially Amazon has quite a bit of research on that because they have the Amazon Mechanical Turk and they have loads of people labeling different data sets.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:14.420
Yeah.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:21.740
And sometimes people will label them wrong and therefore you want to fit your model to some of the labels, see how that compares to other labels.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:31.160
And then kind of given that and for what are the possible kind of labeling noises and given that kind of optimize your model, et cetera, et cetera, and iterate on that continuously.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:31.660
Yeah.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.100
Yeah.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:32.440
Very cool.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.880
Well, this is such a neat project.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:43.740
And like I said, I think it really captures the imagination when people see what you guys have done here because there's so much data out there.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.280
And I think we're just scratching the surface on what we've learned, right?

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:54.840
This stuff is so hard to detect that the more we can do these studies and the more we can learn about stuff outside the solar system is just amazing.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.360
Yeah.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.000
I mean, for sure.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.260
And we're keeping getting more and more data just coming in year on year with this.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:36:59.800
Yeah.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.520
Can you study anything from the ground?

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:07.880
Is there anything accurate enough on ground-based telescopes to give you that level of information or has it got to be as?

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.420
Yeah.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:16.520
So, I mean, we actually run a telescope in Chile called NGTS, the Next Generation Transit Survey, that surveys stars and regularly picks up these transits.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:21.080
What you can't do is get down really to the Earth-sized planets around sun-like stars.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:21.800
That's really tough.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.040
Yeah.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:26.620
But certainly for Neptune-sized planets and Jupyter-sized planets, we can definitely go from the ground.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:26.940
Yeah.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.220
And some of the first transits were found from the ground for sure.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:29.900
Oh, yeah.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.360
Awesome.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:37.380
Now, before we round out our conversation here, I do just want to ask you a couple of more sort of philosophical questions.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:44.660
First of all, it seems to me that there's just an incomprehensible level of stars out there, right?

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.240
We've got how many stars in an average galaxy?

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.140
A hundred billion.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.200
I don't know about the average, but that's about the Milky Way.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:50.960
A hundred billion?

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.620
Yeah.

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:52.560
Something like that.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.480
How many galaxies?

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.920
I mean, uncountable, right?

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.700
They keep going out to the edge of what we can see.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.180
Right.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.180
But it's millions of galaxies?

00:37:59.180 --> 00:37:59.960
Well, more.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.360
I mean, it's not a countable number.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.420
I mean, there's just...

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.200
So, you've got to multiply those two numbers.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.500
And then you think each star may have a planet?

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.740
Many stars have planets?

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.020
Maybe multiple planets?

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:10.880
They're certainly common.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.200
Yeah.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.380
Like, it's probably more common than not, at the very least.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.340
So, yes, there's definitely planets everywhere.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:19.560
It seems incomprehensible to me that life is only here, right?

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.040
Yeah.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.540
And I think a lot of astronomers agree with that.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.000
Though, obviously, we can't detect that life yet.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.560
It seems remarkable that it wouldn't exist.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:26.840
Right.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.640
I mean, what it is hard to say is how often would intelligent life happen and this kind of

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:30.820
thing.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.320
And there's all sorts of open questions there.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:32.720
Yeah.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.660
I think that's a really interesting thing to ponder.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.640
Just, you put those numbers together and the fact that you all just keep discovering more

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.900
and more planets, so they must be fairly common.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:46.120
The chances that there's not something like what we have here in other places in the galaxy,

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.420
it seems pretty small.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:52.760
The chance that we find it or ever interact with it may be zero, but the fact that it exists

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.200
is already interesting to dream about.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:55.480
Wow.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.280
It would be incredible to prove that it exists, that's for sure.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.180
It sure would.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.940
What's even more interesting is that if we do kind of ponder about it, like you said, like

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:11.460
other life forms to exist, the impact it might have on the society and the society's perception

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.020
on itself.

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:16.560
Like as previously when there were big astronomical discoveries that kind of changed our worldview,

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.560
the society changes with that too.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:23.920
And what can be the impacts of, I don't know, if we observe sufficiently many exoplanets and

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.880
we discover something new.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:29.860
Maybe that will change our thinking and the way kind of we operate with one another.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:30.640
I don't know.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.100
Yeah.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:31.940
That would be great.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.000
Or if it turns out that there really is life on Venus.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.280
Yes, that's a very new piece of news that they discovered.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.460
I forgot the gas, but some gas that is typically...

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.300
Phosphine, wasn't it?

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:42.500
Yeah.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.200
Yeah, it was phosphine.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:43.540
That's right.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.980
Amazing.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:49.340
So it feels to me like there must be life out there.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:53.320
And I think your work is tipping the scales and the likelihood of that, even if it has nothing

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.100
to do with actually detecting or interacting the life itself.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.740
It's really cool.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.880
Like you said, you've got to find the planets to be able to look for life on them.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.620
That's right.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.040
Talk Python to Me is partially supported by our training courses.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.780
Python's async and parallel programming support is highly underrated.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:15.020
Have you shied away from the amazing new async and await keywords because you've heard it's

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.180
way too complicated or that it's just not worth the effort?

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:23.420
With the right workloads, a hundred times speed up is totally possible with minor changes to

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:23.780
your code.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.200
But you do need to understand the internals.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:31.320
And that's why our course, Async Techniques and Examples in Python, show you how to write

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.420
async code successfully as well as how it works.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:40.320
Get started with async and await today with our course at talkpython.fm/async.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:47.760
Then the other one, I'm a big fan of SpaceX in the sense that it's really pushed the boundaries

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.060
of what we can do with space.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:53.560
Like when I saw those two rockets land side by side, you know, people thought it was fake

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.260
because it was so synchronized.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.900
And so like, there's no way that it's going to look that good.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.140
That's just CGI, right?

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.460
And so the stuff they're doing is so amazing.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:05.380
And yet they're not always positive for astronomy, right?

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:10.200
Like for their internet satellite stuff, there's a big uproar about them messing up ground-based

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.360
telescopes and stuff, right?

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:11.880
Yeah.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.300
And I could find you some pictures where you see 50 of these satellites sort of streaking

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.180
through the sky, right?

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:16.520
Right.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:16.960
Exactly.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.160
It's not too bad now because there's not that many, but I think they have plans to

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.880
hugely expand the numbers.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.280
Yeah.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.260
So I just wanted to ask you too, what you thought about that?

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.260
I think some of their future generations are supposed to be designed to be a bit less kind

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:32.120
of bright in the images we have, but there's still a big open question about what effect

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:32.700
they're going to have.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.420
I think people aren't really sure yet.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:34.820
Yeah.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.540
It's certainly not exactly my field.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.780
I mean, I work with datasets from satellites, I should say.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.480
The reason I thought about it is those things passing in front of stars are going to mess

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.120
up these light curves very much in the way that some other kind of transit would.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.040
Well, if the light curve is coming from a satellite that's already outside of the orbit of these

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.100
ones, then it's okay, right?

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.140
But all the ground-based stuff can be affected, yeah.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.440
Yeah.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:58.780
And sometimes, I mean, some of the stars we look at are relatively bright, but people study

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.940
these very faint galaxies and things where the signal could be completely drowned out by

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.100
a satellite like that passing.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.740
And that's what makes you worry.

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:10.900
I mean, there's other examples of radio telescopes where the datasets became unusable because of people's

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.500
mobile phones near them and things like that.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:12.860
Right.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.200
So you can see how some of the really sensitive measurements get affected by anything.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.700
And a big trail of bright satellites is going to be something.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.680
It is going to be something.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:25.180
The fact that you all can detect things from so far away and so faint, it still just blows

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:25.620
my mind.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.040
Yeah.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.360
I mean, some of these, like the wobble method you were talking about earlier, like we can

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.440
sometimes measure stars moving towards us at a sort of walking pace.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:33.920
Yeah.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.980
Like when they're orbiting.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:38.540
It's a whole star moving towards us at a few meters per second, like a brisk walk.

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.060
And it's 10 million light years away or something insane, right?

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:42.860
Or how far?

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.480
Hundreds of light years for sure.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.400
Hundreds of light years.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:45.560
Yeah.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:45.760
Okay.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.280
Yeah.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.960
So many, many, many millions of miles, right?

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.940
Very far away.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.560
And it's, yeah, like walking pace.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.060
Unbelievable.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.480
So I don't know.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.300
We'll see what happens.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:58.220
I guess, I mean, maybe there's things you could do if the, what you're measuring is like

00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.240
looking for a long time.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.240
You knew the satellite was coming.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.880
Just don't take that signal at that moment.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.340
have a little gap in the time.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.960
But if there's a continuous stream of them, I mean, what do you do?

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.940
Yeah, I know.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.140
It's not good.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.560
And I think that is the end goal.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:11.940
I think.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:16.940
It's also that to me, the question that comes up with this project that SpaceX has with releasing

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.700
these satellites, it's also like, why do we need that in the first place?

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:24.320
Because to me, it's rather strange and it's kind of more of a symptom of the problems we

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.180
have in our century overall is like the focus is growth, growth, growth.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:28.580
Yeah.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.240
So we can throw satellites in the sky.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.680
Let's just throw even more satellites.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.160
Maybe we don't need that.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.280
And maybe in the first place we need to think about, well, maybe we need to think about degrowth

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.580
if we think about climate change, et cetera, et cetera.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.000
Yeah.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.440
Yeah.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.640
There is an argument for providing internet to a lot of places where you just can't get

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.420
the connections to.

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:48.020
And I think once you get into those sort of things, it's quite hard to decide like what's

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.260
the best thing to do philosophically speaking.

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.760
But if it's a for-profit thing, that's different.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.340
Yeah.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:57.200
I mean, the point there is that there are people and the specialists who study these kind of

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.060
things like anthropologists, et cetera, et cetera, in terms of how much do we need of that

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:01.380
stuff?

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.740
And sometimes it's useful to consult them too.

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:08.120
And maybe we should consult them too in these cases and not just look at it as a technical

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:08.880
kind of thing.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.780
Will it hurt astronomers or will it not hurt astronomers, but look at it from a broader picture.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:13.260
Yeah.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:13.940
It's a good question.

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.540
And I think we're going to leave it there for our main conversation.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.320
But let me ask you the final two questions before I let you all go.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.220
So yeah, we'll start with you.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.660
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:30.160
At the moment, for the most part, I'm using PyCharm and sometimes I'm using Atom and sometimes

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.140
I'm using Veeam if I'm developing on a different machine that I'm connecting to remotely.

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:34.800
All right.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.240
David?

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.800
I've been using TextWrangler for years, which is probably not a very fancy option.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.720
I think it has to be BBEdit now.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.600
They forced me to upgrade.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:42.420
Perfect.

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:48.700
And then a notable PyPI package, like some library out there that you've run across and

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.680
you're like, this is really cool.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.880
It really helped with our project.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.000
Or maybe you don't know about, people should check this out.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.320
You guys got any that come to mind?

00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:00.180
I mean, the obvious one is GPFlow, which enabled a lot of the Gaussian process calculations.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.280
I mean, everyone knows about scikit-learn, I guess.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.480
Yeah, everyone definitely knows about scikit-learn.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:09.660
The one that was most useful to me recently was Rosterio, which is a package that allows you

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:13.720
to work with georeferenced images and remote sensing images.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.080
So that was really useful for me.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.340
And PyTorch.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.300
I really like PyTorch.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:17.760
Big fun.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.160
If we want to get in a whole debate of Keras versus PyTorch, I'm definitely on the PyTorch side.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.160
Yeah, the PyTorch game.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:23.440
Awesome.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:23.780
All right.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.260
Yeah, I hadn't heard of that one for geospatial data.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:26.640
Very cool.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.080
All right.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.120
Final call to action.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.260
People are out there listening.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:33.800
They want to learn more about your study or maybe learn how they can take those ideas

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.860
and apply them to their area of research.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:36.620
What do you say?

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:37.880
Just reach out on Twitter.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:38.520
Yeah.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.620
I mean, if you don't want to read the actual paper, that's definitely the best thing to do.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:42.980
I mean, we're happy to answer questions.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:43.580
Okay, cool.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.920
I'll put your link to your ways to get in touch with you in the show notes.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.060
And of course, the article.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:48.520
Cool.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.020
Sounds good.

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:49.500
Great.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:50.220
Thanks a lot.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:50.680
Yeah.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:50.980
All right.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.160
Thank you guys for being on the show.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.580

And congratulations on doing this work.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:57.460
It's very cool.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:57.920
Yeah.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.640
Thanks for inviting us.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.120
It's been great.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:45:59.420
Yeah.

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:00.040
Thank you so much.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:00.440
Yep.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:00.840
Bye.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.460
Bye-bye.
