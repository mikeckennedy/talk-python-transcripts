00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.580
Do you write tests for your code? You probably should.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.520
And most of the time, pytest is the industry standard these days.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.400
But pytest can be much more than what you just get from installing it as a tool.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.480
There are many amazing plugins that improve pytest in many aspects.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.460
That's why I've invited Brian Okken to the show to tell us about his favorites.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.600
Listen in and your Python testing will be faster, stronger, and more beautiful.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.060
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 267, recorded June 4th, 2020.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:48.480
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.560
This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Twitter where I'm @mkennedy.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.320

Please check out what they're offering during their segments.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.780
It really helps support the show.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.040
Brian, welcome back to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.820
Thanks. It's fun to be back.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.920
Yeah, it's good to have you back.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.300
You've been on a lot of episodes.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.240
You've been on five.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.280
2017 Python Year in Review, 2018 Python Year in Review, the Python Testing Column is a Thing,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.120
30 Amazing Python Projects, which is one of the most popular episodes, actually.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.460
And the book author panel discussion.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.220
So happy to have one more on the list to have you here.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.140
Yeah, it's nice.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.860
I love your show.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.660
Listen to it all the time.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.940
Thanks.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.380
Yeah, and it's good to catch up with you.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.880
It's been a while.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.960
Yeah.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.860
Well, we, I mean, we talk to each other weekly.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.860
That's right.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.440
Of course.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.920
Of course.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.620
Yeah.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.340
So those of you listening who don't know about Python Bytes, that's our other podcast that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.340
Brian and I co-host.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.600
We each have separate podcasts, right?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.780
Talk Python and I do alone.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.540
You do Test and Code, which is really good.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.700
Yes.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.720
Where do people find Test and Code?

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.960
At testandcode.com.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.320
Perfect.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.980
But we also do Python Bytes, which is like a newsletter for Python with analysis and audio

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.260
form.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.000
It's a lot of fun.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.100
Yeah, it is.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.300
People should check that out as well.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.560
So I want to have you tell your story because you probably told it four times out of five there

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.900
anyway.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.160
So let's just sort of check in and see what you've been up to in the last year or so.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.080
It's been actually pretty exciting.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.020
I think I've told the story before, but I work at Roden Schwartz.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.780
So I work at a test and measurement company.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.780
I'm an embedded software developer and a team lead and a lead engineer.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.180
But I've been focusing for the last 10 to 15.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.380
Half of my career has been on communication testing.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.340
Most of it's been cellular stuff and we're switching over the last year or so.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.680
I've been focusing mostly on Wi-Fi testing.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.020
So that's been a lot of fun.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.600
Okay, nice.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.420
Like Wi-Fi 6, that kind of stuff?

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.960
Yes.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.820
One of the fun things lately is some of the work on 802.11x, which is just starting to roll

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.600
out around the world in different places.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.660
Yeah, that's cool.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.020
I'm actually very excited about that.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.540
Yeah.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.840
Yeah.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.340
It's neat.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.120
Also, one of the reasons why I kind of focus on testing a lot is I am a proponent of developing

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.180
software with testing hand in hand so that you develop tests and code at the same time.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.540
Yeah.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.140
It's always very error prone and unlikely to succeed to say, now that you've written the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.120
code, let's go back and add all the tests to it.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.140
Yeah, definitely.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.940
But people don't learn how to write tests when they're in.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.920
I mean, even college classes hardly ever talk about how to write good tests.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.500
Yeah, there's definitely that sort of splintering there.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.440
Like on one hand, the stuff you're building in college, it's probably not going to be long

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.080
lived, right?

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.120
It's an assignment or a short project.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.540
You just want to get it done because you also got that English paper and you didn't really

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.480
even want to take English.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.860
But now you're in there and you got to do it.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.760
So let's just get it done.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.760
And it's a very different thing to think a team of people have to live with this for a

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.440
period of time.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.380
Yeah, definitely.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.400
And with a more and more reliant on, it's a little bit easier of a thing for me to try

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.620
to tell people the importance because they're used to working.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.360
A lot of people are used to working with open source projects now and you would never pull

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.060
an open source project off the shelf and use it if it had zero tests around it.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.280
Yeah.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.300
And a lot of times you've got to have tests to accompany your contributions back if you're

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.140
doing a PR, right?

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.460
Yeah.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.420
Yeah, definitely.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.540
It's getting more and more attention.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.560
And I think that's a good thing.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.700
What's the work from home story for you these days?

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.160
Do you got to go to the office?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.720
I mean, the world scrambled for everyone, but the only part of my world that hasn't changed

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.240
is my work because I've already been fully distributed and whatnot, I guess, other than

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.640
conferences.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.400
But how about you?

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.720
Yeah.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.500
So it was a hard shift.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.980
I think it was early March, was it?

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.100
Really early March.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.480
There was a day where we just got told, grab your stuff and go home.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.920
And we're working from home from now on for a while, at least.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.960
And we had just moved into a beautiful office in July.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.620
So it's...

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.660
It is really nice.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.280
Like, it's a place you would want to go to because it's got cool decor and whatnot.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.660
Yeah.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.820
And these giant training rooms and stuff.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.240
It's a good building.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.500
So working from home, the entire...

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.520
I had just hired a couple people for the team.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.320
And so training people remotely was...

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.740
I thought it was going to be a trick, but it's actually been...

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.800
It's gone really smoothly.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.400
Oh, that's good.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.740
And yeah, so we're a remote team.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.860
We are...

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.100
So in our county...

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.640
So I'm in the county, Washington County that we're in around Portland.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.460
We are supposedly entering phase one.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.740
We're doing this three-stage phase going back to work thing.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.800
We don't know.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.940
We haven't allowed people to go back yet, but hopefully there will be...

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.160
There's some people that can more effectively work from the office.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.300
So we're going to try to get those people back as soon as we can, but do it safely.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.560
Do you think you'll have more work from home remote options?

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.260
Generally, at the company because of this?

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.020
Yeah, I think so.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.860
I think we've...

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.680
One of the fears was...

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.140
Then I think a lot of companies have seen this.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.940
The fear is that people working from home won't...

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.320
They'll be more distracted.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.120
They won't be as productive.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.820
And I don't even know if this is a fair test because everybody's also...

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.940
It's not just working from home, but their kids are home also.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.940
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.340
There's also the stress of just what's going on in the world is a stressful situation.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.340
So even though it's not a fair comparison, we're comparing anyway.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.200
And things are going okay.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.400
We're still being productive, just about as productive or more so than we were before in

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.280
a lot of cases.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.420
The lack of a commute is really easy.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.680
The ease of discussion.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.800
I mean, you can...

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.160
I don't know.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.960
It just is...

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.340
I get more time focused, but also I think I'm talking with my team more often now because

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.780
we make it a point to talk every day as a team.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.720
Right, right.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.600
Focus type stuff, not just, oh, I passed them in the hall sort of thing.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.140
Yeah, that's cool.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.420
Now, one more thing, I guess while we're catching up on this stuff is you've got these really

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.400
beautiful training rooms with nice giant screens.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.640
And one of the things that we were doing together is the Python Portland West meetup, which kind

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.160
of got polished from all this as well, right?

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.220
Yeah, and that's a big bummer because I think it was really serving a community in the west

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.480
side of Portland that didn't have a meetup.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.680
And I would really like to...

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.680
I have no idea when we're going to get back to being able to do that, but I'd like to be

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.360
able to do something.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.200
Yeah, I don't even know when I can go to a restaurant.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.020
So, you know, things are all up in the air.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.980
The world is crazy.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.440
Yeah, definitely.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.280
Yeah.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.360
All right, cool.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.700
Well, good to catch up.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.120
Now, let's talk some pie tests.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.980
I'd like to do just a little bit of high-level stuff to just like set the stage, and then

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.200
we're going to dive into the plugins.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:47.600
So, pytest is an external separate way to write and test Python code.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.820
Just not, say, part of Python like UnitTest.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:55.360
So, maybe let's just do like a quick survey of the modern testing tools that people might

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.000
potentially use, and then like how we'd write tests in pytest for those who maybe have only

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.240
done UnitTest type testing, or they're like, testing, maybe I should do that.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.260
Yeah, sure.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:04.300
Sure.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.560
Well, actually, you had a few on the list that I deleted, but...

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.920
Because they're no longer modern, right?

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.760
Well, I would say not.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.380
There still is UnitTest, and UnitTest is being supported, and I do think, and it's part of

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.880
the Python distribution.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.260
That's the one winning point, I think, right?

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:27.820
It's like, I don't have to have a requirements.txt or pip install anything, potentially, and I

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.500
can still write tests.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:28.880
Yeah.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.260
One of the main reasons why it's there is to test Python and test the standard library.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.980
And I think that that's a good reason for it.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.800
There's a bunch of people that have built on tools around it, and I think that's fine, but

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.540
it's just not my thing.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.320
One of the things, while we're talking about other testing app things, is it's a good thing

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.580
to note that Nose is still available, but I don't recommend anybody use Nose or Nose2 or

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:59.900
any of its variants, because, I don't know, Nose is not being supported at all anymore.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:06.620
And Nose2 has very little traction, and I don't know if it's, I don't currently know

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.180
if it's active.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.920
So, if you're currently working on Nose, sorry about the disparaging remark, but maybe correct

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.720
me if I'm wrong.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.300
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.440
Well, I mean, the thing is, you've got all these choices, right?

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.840
Like, if it's pytest or some of these other things like Nose or something, it's like, well,

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.500
okay.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.140
Which one are you going to pick, right?

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.220
First got into it, I really, I was looking for the easiest.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.920
And I thought that maybe the easiest and the most powerful would be two different things,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:35.420
but it turns out that pytest is both the easiest and the most powerful, which is nice.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:35.760
Nice.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.120
There's some other ones, though, that you might consider.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.640
Yeah.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.680
Well, in conjunction with pytest and other testing things, there's a lot of other tools that people

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.040
use.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:50.280
Tox is used, it is not just a testing tool, but one of the neat things about it is you can

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.380
do a test matrix or running different Python environments.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.820
It creates a, it tests a lot of your application.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.380
It's pretty, almost an episode in itself.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:58.600
Right.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:04.300
You can test on like various versions, like Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and stuff with that, right?

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:04.760
Yeah.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.100
And typically, if you're running, like running pytest, pytest doesn't automatically build your

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:16.800
application for you, but Tox, part of its process is creating the wheel of your, like if you're

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.220
doing a package, it'll create the package for you and then install it.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.460
And it does the whole round trip thing.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.280
So that's cool.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:25.480
Nice.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.120
Okay, cool.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.820
A lot of people are moving to, so continuous integration is definitely a thing that's important

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.440
everywhere.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:39.200
And a couple years ago, it was probably Jenkins or Travis that people were using, but now

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.080
I think more, a lot of people are moving to GitHub Actions because they're just right there

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:44.960
with your code.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.940
So why not?

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.060
Yeah, that's super easy.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.860
And it totally solves the problem that is, I think, one of the really big challenges of

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.240
testing in teams is you get different levels of buy-in from different participants in the

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.580
team.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:03.640
And some people are very, they just are reluctant to just run the test before they'll do a check-in.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.000
Yeah.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.620
They'll break the test, they'll do a check-in, and they don't even know they broke it, but

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.360
they don't care that much.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.980
I mean, people care to differ in degrees, but it's like, well, they're kind of a nuisance,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.000
but I guess if you're going to make me write tests, I will.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:14.560
Right.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.580
And so the continuous integration is like, everyone gets checked before we accept your

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.040
stuff, right?

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.460
Well, right.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:26.180
So hooking it up within a GitHub Action, you could do this before, but it's really easy with

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.860
these, is to just say, if you'd like, for instance, a merge request doesn't even go,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.860
doesn't even go very far if the test fails.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.320
So yeah.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.340
Listing coverage.py, because I'm, if you care about coverage, that's how you do that in Python.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.920
I don't do a lot of web testing, but I wanted to point out that Selenium and a wrapper around

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.140
Selenium called Splinter are very commonly used.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:54.260
And then these are all packaged very well within a plugin called pytest Splinter so that you

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.940
can easily control web applications.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.540
Nice.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.300
I hadn't heard of that one.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.760
I've heard of Selenium, but not Splinter.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.180
Yeah.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:06.080
A property-based testing is gaining a lot more traction in conjunction with functionality testing.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.660
And the solution within Python is a hypothesis for that.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:10.980
Nice.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.040
So everything you've listed here is pytest Plus, not instead of, right?

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.660
Well, sure.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.360
It's pytest Plus these other things.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.400
However, they, I mean, none of them are pytest only.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.620
So you can use unit test with all of these things as well.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:23.880
Yeah.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.880
Or yeah, testing framework plus, right?

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.120
They're not necessarily alternatives.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.600
Yeah.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.060
Right.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:28.480
All right.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:28.680
Cool.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.100
So those are definitely neat things to look into.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.380
They're separate projects.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.680

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.640
Oh, and one last thing.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.420
They're hiring.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.540
Go to linode.com slash careers to find out more.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.840
Let them know that we sent you.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.900
Now, like I said, just for people who maybe haven't written a test in pytest,

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.720
like, what's the really quick flow?

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.740
Like, why is it so simple?

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:47.000
pytest has a really great discovery mechanism, but a function that just starts with,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.380
like, if you have a test file that starts with test underscore,

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.320
there's some naming conventions.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.080
So the easiest thing is to have a test file that has test underscore in it,

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.700
and then start your functions, test functions with test underscore,

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.940
and then it'll all just get run.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:07.280
So pytest will find all of the files that start with test underscore and run all of the functions

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.160
within them that start with test underscore, and then that's it, really.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.240
And so how does a test pass or fail?

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.160
It fails if an exception is raised, and the easiest way to raise an exception is to,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.180
if you're intentionally checking something, is to use assert.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:27.380
So you, like, assert A equals B or something, and if the assertion fails, your test fails.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.140
It's that easy.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:33.680
Yeah, so you don't have to have decorators or derive from certain classes or anything like that.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.780
It's just the name involves test underscore, and you assert stuff.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:37.700
That's pretty good.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.620
Yeah, you don't even have to import pytest into your test files.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.920
They can be just functions.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.160
Yeah, that's right.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.760
So unless you're using some of the unique features that, like, extend pytest,

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.000
like you talked about the way a test fails if there's an exception.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.340
Well, if you're testing for error handling,

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.680
sometimes you want to trigger an exception and verify it has happened.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.840
So in that case, you'd have to include some pytest stuff to do, like,

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.880
the width raises sort of stuff on it.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.260
But in general, for, like, the straight-ahead test,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.600
you don't even need to import pytest.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.380
Which is kind of weird.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.640
That freaked me out a little bit at first.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.340
I'm like, why am I not interacting with pytest?

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.600
This is so weird at a code level.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.640
No, it's beautiful.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.520
It's one of the things I like is that it's just easy to start.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:17.920
Absolutely.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.480
Now, one other thing I want to cover before we dig into the list of plugins

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:29.320
that we're going to cover is there's some non-obvious other ways to extend pytest, right?

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:35.240
Like, it has this concept of fixtures that allow you to create and initialize stuff,

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.780
and then automatically pytest has a way to, like, pass it along to your tests and whatnot.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:46.660
You'll see some of these plugins actually use fixtures, like some stuff about modifying time and whatnot that we'll talk about.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.160
What's the deal with those?

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:58.140
Well, so the unit test model, and the unit test is similar to a lot of the X unit type, like J unit and PHP unit and stuff,

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.800
have a similar model where you just, things are just named also and the tests get run.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.620
But there's often times where you need stuff to happen before your test gets run,

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.680
like setting up a resource or generating data or something like that.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:17.260
And there's, so there's setup and teardown functions that you can, that are associated with these other test frameworks.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.500
pytest actually also supports those sorts of setup and teardown functions.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.640
If you want to use them, they are supported.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.460
But it's really not recommended because fixtures are so awesome.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:35.580
So a fixture is a way to combine, like, to write a function that is handling a resource or handling some data

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:42.020
and be able to do the setup and teardown within one function and, if necessary.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.180
And then also just be able to scope those.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:53.440
And you can, you can have them have the resource or data shared between one test or many tests or even across the entire project.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.660
And you can control, you know, like if you're initializing a database or connecting to a web resource,

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.340
you might not want to do that for every test.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.160
You can do it for one, once per session and then, and then do things like rollbacks and stuff per test.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:14.540
And that granularity of being able to shift your, the granularity of your setup and teardown is super powerful

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.880
and really helps makes pytest shine.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.120
Yeah.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.320
And the way that you write it is super cool as well, right?

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.660
Just have a test function that just takes a parameter.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:27.840
The parameter is named the same as the fixture and pytest just says, okay, I really call this function and pass it over.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.420
It could do really cool things.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.860
Like you could pass off your database data access layer and it could start a transaction before, hand it to you,

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.160
and then roll back the transaction after the test is over.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:38.900
Right.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.160
And you don't have to worry about it.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.260
It could just take care of that for you.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:41.620
Yeah.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.220
Yep.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.740
And the fixtures are really what brought me to pytest.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.460
Some of the, there's some massively cool things you can do with that.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:55.100
Like one of the things that people don't think about is if you've got a system under test that has error logs somewhere,

00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:02.360
one of the things you can do within a fixture is check your error logs after the test runs to make sure there's no fatal errors that got saved somewhere.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.060
Yeah.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:03.460
Yeah.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:03.840
Very cool.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.800
Love it.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.080
Okay.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:05.940
So that's one way.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.480
The other one is this plugins in general, right?

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.200
Like there's ways to extend pytest with plugins as a concept.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.600
The pytest has a whole set of hook functions as well.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.260
There's, there's a lot of things you can do.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.380
You can, you can write fixtures and package those fixtures for other people to use.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.200
So some plugins are just packaged fixtures.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.520
Other things you can do with hook functions.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:40.020
So with, I actually was intimidated when I first was reading about hook functions, but they're just, there's just a way for pytest to allow different parts of the way pytest runs to be hooked into.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:45.300
So you can, you know, alter a few things if you need to, like, like some of the test ordering ones.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:52.900
Once all the tests are collected, you can hook into that section and reorder them if you need to, or, or filter them.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.360
Choose which ones execute, right?

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:54.960
Yeah.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:05.220
There's a whole bunch of ways you can hook into it and it's fairly complex, but a lot of people have come up with some really clever things and plugins allow you to allow you to do that.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:19.300
And I mean, not just third party plugins that you can pull off of PyPI, but you can also just, if you want to share some code that you have that works with your tests amongst different projects, you can package your own plugins to do that.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:19.620
Yeah.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.280
Oh, that's cool.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.140
You could even have them for like your company, right?

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.000
Like we always do this in RCI and whatnot.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.640
You can just grab a plugin and do stuff.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:28.920
Yeah.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.420
Like I've got plugins that I've written that, that just are particular to one particular test piece of test equipment.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.840
So to control this piece of equipment, you can use this plugin and it helps you with some of the common things.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.460
Oh, that's cool.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.800
Makes it a little easier for new people.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.140
Yeah.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:42.680
Yeah.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.220
Lots easier.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:43.680
Nice.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.680
All right.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.060
I think it's time we go down the list.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.120
We've set the stage.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.420
We know what fixtures are.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.080
We know what plugins are, at least in general.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.040
Let's put some sugar on pytest to make it sweet.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.600
Yeah.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.280
So we're going to run through a whole bunch of really cool pytest plugins, right?

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.180
All right.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.040
What's this first one here?

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.900
So sugar is a fun one, actually.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.560
I ran into this right away with looking at pytest.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:16.160
So the default output of pytest is you, when you run it, you get a dot shows up for every, for every test that gets run.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.740
And it does list the files, but a little dot shows up.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.000
And maybe that's not enough for you.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.280
So pytest sugar shows you, like, green check marks instead.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:33.780
So, and then, you know, instead of, like, Fs for failure, I think there's, like, red Xs or something that show up.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:38.200
So it alters the output of pytest so that it looks a little nicer.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:46.500
Yeah, it also looks like it might be suppressing the module name, the folder names, and only, like, highlighting the actual file names.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.320
So it does, like, gray out a little part of the UI.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.840
So, like, the actual test file being run stands out.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.540
And there's a vertical progress bar going along that runs as well.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.100
That's pretty sweet.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.080
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.620
And that was especially really helpful before pytest added the percentage done.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:07.040
So now, for each file, pytest lists the percent done now by default.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.500
But it didn't always have that, and pytest sugar had that.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.140
It's pretty cool.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:11.740
Yeah, it's cool.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:20.360
And there's a nice little animated GIF, as all things should have, on there that I'll link to in the show notes so people can check it out and see it going.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.380
So, yeah, pytest sugar.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:26.480
And this is cool because all you've got to do is install this, and it doesn't require effort, right?

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.500
And, like, oh, and now I can do this thing in code.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.100
It's just, like, I install this, and it looks better.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:31.440
Yeah.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.880
How do you install plugins?

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.160
Just do you pip install them?

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.760
Like, do I need to register it with pytest, or is it sufficient to just pip install it?

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.860
Just pip install it.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.000
It's about the design of the plugin as well.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.580
So some plugins, like Sugar, you just install it, and it starts working.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.520
You don't have to do anything.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.000
All right.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.100
But some of them intentionally don't start right away.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:55.940
So some plugins, they are installed, but you have to turn on the functionality with a flag or something like that.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.240
Got you.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:56.760
Okay.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.680
Cool.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.000
All right.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.780
What's the next one?

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.360
Number two.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:07.980
So this one's definitely something, pytest cov, dash cov, it's a way to run coverage with pytest together.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:13.280
So, I mean, there's really two ways to run coverage on pytest tests.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.620
Coverage doesn't require pytest, right?

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.080
So you can use any test framework.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.680
So you can run pytest from coverage, or you can run coverage from pytest.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.460
It's kind of a choice.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.920
But I usually use pytest cov because it's just really well supported.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.420
It does some really cool things.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:36.420
One of the things that it does really nice is, we'll talk about xDisk later, but xDisk allows

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.240
parallel runs.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:44.280
And pytest cov cleanly collects all of the different parallel runs and pulls the report, coverage

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.420
report together for you.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.000
Oh, that's cool.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.860
Which is really nice.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.300
Yeah, it has xDisk support, which we'll talk about what that means.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:56.580
But that's a pretty high-end piece of kit there to go grab a parallel executing stuff and bring

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.020
it all together.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:01.440
Yeah, and there's also, it's really good about catching the coverage from right from the beginning.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.560
So you've got like some startup code that happens, like your fixtures and stuff that you've set

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:13.220
up that run before your tests, making sure that those have coverage turned on as soon as

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.040
possible so that you don't have startup code that doesn't get run and coverage.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.880
That's one of the issues with hooking up coverage often.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.880
But pytest cov handles that really cleanly.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.700
Yeah, awesome.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.780
It also has sub-process support, so you can fork things into a sub-process and it'll get

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.800
covered automatically, which you might think, okay, who's going to do that?

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.140
And like, do they really care about tracking the coverage of it?

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.140
But, you know, multiprocessing, right?

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.320
They're doing parallelism.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.380
Yeah, definitely.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.960
Yeah, that's good as well.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.160
Very nice.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.800
The other nice thing about it is just, so if you're, it makes it easy to have a text output.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.700
So normally when you run coverage outside of, like if you run pytest from coverage, once

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.780
you're finished, you have to then tell coverage to give you the reports.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.820
You have to run coverage report to get your coverage report.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.480
But pytest cov just prints that at the end.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.940
So you get that automatically.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.080
Don't have to run it again.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:08.320
Cool.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:08.980
Very nice.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.320
Very nice.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.920
Would you say it's low stress?

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.780
It is low stress, yes.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.740
Unless the stress is trying to get 100% coverage.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.960
Well, that's true.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.940
Actually, what are your thoughts on, I'll share my thoughts with you as well, but, you know,

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.160
a lot of people feel like they're not testing well if they don't have 100% coverage or they

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:27.960
don't have any coverage.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.880
So they don't even know like how much of their code is being run by tests.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.700
Like what are your thoughts there?

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:39.280
I am a strong proponent for open source projects to have 100% coverage because it eases new

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.220
people, new developers into the project.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.540
When they add code, it's easy for them to find the code that they added that isn't being covered

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:45.800
yet.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.380
It doesn't necessarily mean that your tests are good.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.740
It just means that their code's covered.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.780
For open source stuff, it's good.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:25:00.000
And then if you take that argument, then it's good for internal projects as well because it's

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.300
easier to run stuff.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.120
However, I'm not a zealot about it.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.400
I mean, if you're like jumping into a legacy project and adding software tests to a project

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.520
and you're testing the new stuff and the things that you change, you're never going to hit

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.980
100% coverage of like the rest of the legacy code.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.900
And, you know.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.820
Yeah, I agree with that.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:26.060
I feel like a lot of people get hung up on like the last mile for applications, like for

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.840
open source projects where it's like a library or something.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.280
Sure.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.900
It should totally all be there.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.240
But there's like in certain apps, there's just little edge cases.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.660
Like if I'm running on Windows, I got to do this other thing, but I'm only testing this

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.600
on macOS or on Linux.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.060
Right.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:46.280
So like how much should I stress about trying to like get that little edge piece of code to

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.460
run or like there's this.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.880
This one utility that only I run and a cron job to do this thing.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.140
I don't know.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.200
There's just all these little edge cases that can be like a whole lot of work to get to.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.040
But I feel like, you know, most of the time, you know, you should probably not stress too

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.520
much about it.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:01.700
Yeah.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.780
So all those edge cases are the reasons why I think you should test those.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.680
Because.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.320
Okay.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.700
So we have ways to combine coverage reports.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:16.900
So you can use something like GitHub Actions or Travis or something to run your, run your

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.840
code on multiple platforms and combine the coverage from the test runs from multiple platforms.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.880
So why not run them on multiple platforms?

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.300
If that, if you have platform specific code, if you have a platform specific code, I think

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.040
there's a reason is because some of your customers use it.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:38.100
And if it's different than what the developers use, I think you should test that code.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.040
Yeah, that's probably true.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:39.720
That's a good point.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.260
That's the only place it gets run before it gets deployed.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.480
All right.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.340
Well, my transition to the stress one, we got kind of sidetracked.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.400
But this next one is all about stress.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:50.800
Yeah.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.120
So I think we should actually just cover a couple of them.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.000
So the next two.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.400
Yeah.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.540
They're kind of a good pair.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.020
Yeah.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:56.460
Yeah.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.560
And pytest repeat.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.220
So pytest stress is a nice thing.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.640
So let's say you've got some code that you just run it like overnight.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.220
I know that I'm going to leave it like a mid.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.180
I want to, I know everybody's going to be out of the building by midnight.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:16.160
And then I want to just beat on the code and run it as many times as I can for eight hours.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:24.760
So pytest stress allows you to be able to run a set of time to say, hey, run this for eight hours or run it for a half an hour, run it for a certain time period.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.580
And that's really cool if that's where you're thinking.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.900
And then repeat.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:34.520
pytest repeat allows you to run your test suite or test functions or whatever a certain number of times.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.440
So I want to set it up for a thousand times.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.780
I bring these up together because I found pytest repeat first when I needed to.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:47.980
I had some tests that, a test that was failing once in a while and I just wanted to run it all night long.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.140
And so I just set it for a large number like 2000.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:51.600
I don't know.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.000
Like I just guessed.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.160
But really what I wanted it to do was run all night.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.220
And so pytest stress would have been better for that case.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.700
Oh yeah, that's a cool one.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.200
You know where I would see these as being useful?

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:09.200
Sometimes I'm trying to do profiling, like CPU profiling to figure out or maybe even memory profiling.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:19.740
And the startup of getting the pytest or whatever it is up and running and all the stuff in place and then running a little bit of code and then tearing it all down.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.980
It's like gets dwarfed.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:25.040
You know, the actual bit you're trying to understand gets dwarfed by all that startup.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.020
But here you could just let it run for 10 minutes and then it'll be really focused on what it was slow at.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:34.420
Then that's where actually with profiling, I think that would be a good place to use the repeat.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:40.640
So you could say do a nice round number like 100 times or a thousand times because it's easy to divide by that.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.240
Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:42.580
Exactly.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.500
Nice.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.880
What's this next one?

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.580
InstaFail.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:51.980
So if you had a whole bunch of like print statements and whatever in your code, it doesn't get shown normally with pytest.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.280
So pytest will capture the output by default.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280
I mean, you can turn it off.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.840
But by default, it captures the output and any errors and failures and stuff.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.920
Those get captured also, like tracebacks and stuff.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:15.220
And then afterwards, so after the test is done, you get your report and then you get a lot of this output that you can help debug your test failures with.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:24.420
With long running tests, sometimes it'd be really nice if you really could see those errors while it's happening.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.920
So you can start looking at the code and start debugging right away.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:34.520
And that's where InstaFail will report your failures and errors while the test run is happening, even with output being captured.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.120
Nice.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:44.980
Is there a way with plugins where if I've installed InstaFail, but I only want to see it some of the time to like encode, say, you know, don't run InstaFail right now.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.860
But sometimes when I want it, let it run without pip uninstalling it.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.360
I'm not sure, actually.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.140
That would be sweet.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.120
Yeah.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.040
I don't know.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.760
It could be up to them individually, but it would be nice if maybe a command line or something.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.100
I don't know.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.520
Some way to say, actually, I want this other one turned on now, but not always.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.620
Well, I'm just looking at it.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.180
So it looks like even if it has it installed, it doesn't.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.400
This is one of those that it doesn't run automatically.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.000
You have to pass in the flag.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.380
I see.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:09.680
Okay.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.140
Cool, cool.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:10.780
To turn it on.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:11.200
Nice.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.500
Speaking of passing flags and whatnot, pytest metadata is the next one.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:15.960
Number six.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.300
Yeah.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.760
This is a kind of an obscure one.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.900
And this is often used with pytest HTML, which actually we're not covering.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:23.660
Maybe we should.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.800
But pytest InstaFail, or not InstaFail.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.520
Metadata.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.400
Metadata.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.320
Metadata allows you to either through, it gives you a couple of things.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:39.700
It has a command line flag where you can pass in extra information to go into your test report.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:46.540
And then also you can within, so like for instance, if you're running against a particular set of servers,

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.440
you could have the server name getting listed in the report.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:31:03.400
The other thing is maybe the data that you really want to log, the extra metadata about a test run, is generated or like in real time is developed or gotten from within a fixture or something.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:09.360
So a fixture or a test can set this extra metadata and it gets output with your test data.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.100
Oh, cool.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:17.860
Like maybe what GitHub branch you were running on or what environment like staging or production testing or whatever.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.520
Yeah.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.100
Yeah.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:19.520
Yeah, cool.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.260
Or maybe adding, you know, what operating system.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.620
I mean, your operating system's already being logged.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:30.820
But if there's other information like, yeah, what branch, what version, what some of the extra specifics.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.540
Yeah.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:31.740
Yeah.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.480
That's cool.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.220
Yeah.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:33.960
That sounds useful.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:40.420
Like if you're saving the report and you're going to look at it later, like maybe continuous integration or something like that.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:40.640
Yeah.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:49.380
So like for instance, when I'm testing against electronic test equipment, we add the instrument that we're testing against.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.480
So that's just part of the log.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:56.200
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Sentry.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.860
How would you like to remove a little stress from your life?

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:04.600
Do you worry that users may be having difficulties or are encountering errors with your app right now?

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.480
Would you even know it until they send that support email?

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:17.860
How much better would it be to have the error details immediately sent to you, including the call stack and values of local variables, as well as the active user stored in the report?

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.660
With Sentry, this is not only possible, it's simple and free.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.020
In fact, we use Sentry on all the Talk Python web properties.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:31.600
We've actually fixed a bug triggered by our user and had the upgrade ready to roll out as we got the support email.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.400
That was a great email to write back.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.840
We saw your error and have already rolled out the fix.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.080
Imagine their surprise.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.720
Surprise and delight your users today.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:47.600
Create your free account at talkpython.fm/sentry and track up to 5,000 errors a month across multiple projects for free.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:58.880
And if you use the code talkpython, all one word, it's good for two free months of Sentry's team plan, which will give you up to 20 times as many monthly events and some other features.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.600
So create that free account today.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.300
Yeah, I don't want to just be random.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.420
Not just random.

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.020
Yeah.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.080
But sometimes you do.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:12.740
So one of the things that pytest will actually, I think I've intentionally forgotten the test order.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.840
I think it's alphabetical or just it's not alphabetical.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.060
It's like the order that the tests are in in the file.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.120
That's how the default order that things get run in.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.320
But you really don't want your test to be order dependent.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.160
So you want to be able to run any test in any order.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.560
And sometimes a good way to test that is with the pytest Randomly plugin.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.040
So it does a couple of things.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:43.140
One of the things you can do is it can reorder your tests so that they're running in a random order.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:48.900
But also you might be using random as a seed for some randomized information.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:54.400
Like say, like Faker, for instance, and other fake data generators use random seeds.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:59.760
So pytest Randomly can help you randomize that stuff so that it's more random.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.500
Yeah, that's cool.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:07.320
It says that if Faker, which is a really cool library, if Faker is installed, it'll automatically update it.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.180
So that Faker is different this time than another time.

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:11.600
Same thing for NumPy.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.040
Yeah, this is really cool.

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:23.260
Anytime you have your test running reliably in the same order, you could unintentionally pick up some form of dependency on order.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:27.240
Like if you call this test, it like initializes the database connection string.

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.440
And then you can call this other thing and it'll work.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.980
But if you call it in the other order, it would crash.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.320
I mean, maybe that's a bad example because you really want to avoid that dependency.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.020
But you know what I mean?

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:39.860
Like it could set something where the next thing depends on it being set that way.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.740
And if you randomly order it, then you're going to discover those.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:52.160
Yeah, especially with your scoping your fixtures to try to speed up test time, you might inadvertently have dependencies like system dependencies.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.460
For instance, you get the system in a particular state in one test and then you're running another test.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:04.240
One of the problems often is you got a test that runs fine when you're running it from your editor.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.060
And then you go into on the CI system where it's running everything.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.100
It fails.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.640
And you can consistently fail it with the entire suite, but not by itself.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.160
Those are just a pain in the rear to find out where the problem really is.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.760
And I mean, randomly can help you.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.840
I'm not sure how well it can help you debug that problem, but it can help find dependency.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.160
Yeah, at least it won't leave it covered up, hidden.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:29.540
Yeah.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:29.940
Yeah.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:36.440
Well, you already mentioned exodist earlier when we talked about pytestCov.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.800
So what's this exodist?

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.800
Well, exodist is super powerful.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.420
It's a little bit of a grab bag of a few features.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:49.380
One of the things that it does, and people usually grab it for this, is to run tests in parallel.

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:54.860
So you can tell it how many CPUs to run on and it'll just run a whole bunch of tests in parallel.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.100
And that's pretty cool.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.260
It can speed up tests.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:03.160
It does have a little bit of startup time because it's communicating with the different, you know,

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.300
it's doing multi-process communications, a little bit of startup time.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.840
So if you have independent tests that don't share a resource, this can be really cool.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:16.320
The other thing that you can also just offload it onto different processes or different computers,

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.460
you can have it be running on different machines as well.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.320
So that's pretty cool.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:20.580
That's cool.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.560
That's really cool.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.720
Yeah, that's very fascinating.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.180
And then I don't know why this is bundled into it, but this is a really cool feature of pytest

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.620
exodist is the loop on fail feature.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:35.760
So you can pass it loop on fail and it'll run your tests repeatedly in a sub process.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.620
And then you get to see what the failures are.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:46.060
But if it detects you've changed your project at all, it'll rerun the test, but it just reruns the failing tests.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:50.480
So it just keeps rerunning all of your failures while you're trying to fix it.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:57.540
And then once all of them are, when everything's running and fixed, it'll rerun everything.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.060
So when they all pass, it'll rerun the whole suite.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.960
Yeah, super cool.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:07.000
So it's a little bit like in PyCharm where you can say, run the test when anything changes,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.740
but this only does it for the failure.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:13.860
So you're like, you got to, you write a failing test or you have a failing test you're trying to fix and you can just work on it.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.700
And it only focuses on that thing.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.040
Yeah.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:22.120
I mean, it kind of is all the passing ones too, because if your suite is passing, it just keeps rerunning it every time it sees a change.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:22.420
I see.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:22.840
Okay.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.520
Yeah.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.040
Cool.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.760
All right.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:31.040
Well, one way your code can fail is it doesn't execute properly, makes a mistake.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:37.880
The other one is it could just not be formatted the way you like or break some of the idioms that you're supposed to write.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.080
Yeah.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.360
There's a whole bunch of extra plugins that are like this, but they're style guide stuff.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:51.000
So pytest Flakes is one where it can run Flake 8 and other things against your code as part of the pytest run.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.960
It can test both your source code and your test code if you wanted to.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:00.980
I actually think this is a pretty cool idea, but there is some controversy as to whether this should be really part of,

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:06.340
your pytest run or it should be part of like, say, do a pre-commit or something.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.060
But I think having it in both places is fine.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:17.660
If your workflow is mostly people run pytest to make sure all their code's working and then they're ready to check it in.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:26.400
If you want to make sure you don't, it's just your workflow, whether you like to catch your Flake errors during commit time or during test time.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:26.640
Yeah.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:32.920
And I just noticed the one that I grabbed to throw into the list, there was pytest Flakes, I think.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.760
And they say you should use pytest dash Flake 8.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.040
So I'm going to link to that one.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.520
But same idea.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:38.920
Yeah.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.740
Yeah.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.400
There's also a pytest PEP 8, I think it is.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.000
There's like various different ones for this.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:46.320
Yeah.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.800
And I got to admit, I'm like a little, I guess, over the top.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.160
I use both pytest Flake 8 and hookup Flake 8 to pre-commit hook.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.680
So just because, I mean, pre-commit is so fast.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.160
Why not?

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.220
Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.040
Cool.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:38:59.340
Cool.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:04.640
Speaking of being fast, you know, your tests sometimes are slow because it's a lot of work to run your tests.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.600
Or they could just be stuck waiting on something.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:15.060
Yeah, I really like, so pytest Timeout is a plugin that is a fairly big hammer to a problem.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:19.060
But you've got tests that maybe it loops forever.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.120
You forgot to put a timer on something.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.360
Or it's stuck on a resource.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.180
Or for any reason, it's hung.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:30.280
And I suggest people use pytest Timeout for any long-running suites all the time.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:35.020
For really short, fast tests, there is a little bit of overhead.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.400
But for any sort of long-running stuff, the overhead is negligible and you don't see it.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:46.720
But what it does is it runs your tests in another thread and then is able to kill it.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:52.100
So it will just put a timer around it and kill the thread if it doesn't come back in time.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:57.380
Why I call it a big hammer is because if it fails, you don't get your test output.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.440
But it also doesn't hang forever.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.940
And these are especially good for CI systems.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:08.440
Because you really don't want to come back in the morning and notice that your test suite has been running for 12 hours.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.020
And it's only really supposed to run for 20 minutes.

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.460
Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:19.120
Yeah, if it's unattended or it's really long-running or you're talking to something that who knows how long it's going to take to respond.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.580
Yeah, maybe even have that with instruments that you're testing and whatnot.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.920
Yeah, we definitely use it.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:31.640
And the nice thing is you can have a global timeout to say, hey, no tests should run longer than this long.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.200
So whatever, 10 minutes.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.480
Whatever is in your system is a reasonable amount of time.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.040
And then you can override that within.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:43.040
We can put decorators on individual tests to say, well, this test is really fast.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.660
It really should only be this long.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.120
And whatever, you can fine-tune it if you need to.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:47.420
Nice.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.800
All right, another one.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.900
I think I threw this one on the list is spec.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.260
Yeah, I don't know anything about this.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.800
Yeah, so spec, it's a little bit like sugar.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.300
It allows you to sort of control the output.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.420
So you can group tests by classes or by files.

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:06.200
The failed, passed, and skipped ones are marked and colored.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.120
You can remove like test underscore and underscore stuff from the test.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:17.740
So it'll like, you might have a name where it's like test user can log in with underscores.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:22.840
And I think it'll take those out so it looks more like English, like user can log in or something like that.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.900
So it's just a nice little one for customizing.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.700
There's some options you can pass to it and whatnot.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.000
Cool.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:28.560
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.360
I've heard you talk about pytest Picked before.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.520
Yeah, that's a fun little plugin.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.000
So do you remember what this does?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:36.500
Yes.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.320
Yeah, so this is the one.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.480
And we weren't totally sure like how smart it was.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.240
We had a bit of a conversation about it.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:51.380
But this one will run tests that are not checked into GitHub or have changes that are not checked into GitHub.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.320
Oh, that's nice.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.380
Yeah, so it'll run tests related to unstaged files.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:07.240
And if it sees some that are, you know, there, it'll basically, if you're in a GitHub repo, you can run tests that are modified, but not checked in, not committed.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.760
Yeah, and that's usually often what you want to be doing, right?

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.620
Exactly.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:21.320
What I would really like it to do, and I don't think it does, and people can add a comment at the bottom of the show page if that's changed or still misunderstood.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:29.740
But I would love it to somehow use coverage to see what are the files that need to be retested.

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:34.240
Like what tests touch, like I've got a non-test file I change.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.700
What tests need to be rerun?

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.180
I think it only just reruns the tests that are changed.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.600
I don't think it uses coverage, but I could be wrong about that.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.540
But nonetheless, it's still pretty cool.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.440
Yeah, I mean, all of the pieces are together for somebody to do something like this.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:47.800
Yeah.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.040
Because coverage has a context feature now, so you can tell it.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:59.480
And with pytestCov, it automatically sets it up so that you can tell which tests touched which parts of your code.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.760
And the idea seems like great.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:07.280
One of the issues with that is there's a whole bunch of your code that gets hit by every test.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:07.640
Yeah.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.340
Because it's like startup code or something like that.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.080
Right, right.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.740
Well, you just don't change the startup code.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:13.920
You can't edit that part.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:14.680
Yeah.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:24.040
No, but still, it is a really cool idea to say like just run the stuff that might have had some influence on.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:24.600
That's really cool.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:24.940
Yeah.

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.400
So pytestPick doesn't do that, but it has this.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.000
It does a really cool, it's a nice addition to be able to run the tests that you're working on.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:40.980
Yeah, I could totally see just running this and then using like a pre-commit hook to run everything or just, you know, right before you check in, just run everything.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.240
Or even just check it in and it runs in CI and doesn't get merged if it fails, right?

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.240
Like if there's some other gated mechanism further down, then this seems pretty cool.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.040
Yeah, definitely.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:49.420
Yeah.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:53.680
So this next one, FreezeGun, is all about time.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.980
And this one I feel like is probably packaged as a fixture.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.120
At least it has a fixture concept.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.260
Definitely as a fixture.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:04.040
It doesn't run by default, but you have to kind of turn it on when you know it.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.200
Yeah, this one, people know it once they hear what it does.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.560
You don't want this to run by default.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.140
I like to list this one, but just, it's such a great name, FreezeGun.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.020
Oh, yeah.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.060
It's for changing time.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:24.740
You can easily, there's fixtures around it so that you can easily either freeze time so that you're, anytime you grab the time of day or the date time stuff, it's always going to be the same.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:29.760
Or you can, you know, fast forward or change the date or do things like that.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:36.840
So one of the hard things is around testing code that deals with time because you have to know what the answer is going to be.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.640
And it's going to be different every time.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.300
So FreezeGun allows you to test time-related tests really easily.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.980
Plus, it's just such a great name.

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:45.460
It is.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:54.800
And you have these functions, they can take a freezer object and then basically that, what is that probably behind the scenes patch, like the time functions, date time.now and whatnot.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.300
And then you can also do like freezer, move to some other time.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.440
And then like instantly you are transformed either into the future or the past.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:02.720
Yeah.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:08.120
And I think some people might be using mock for that sort of thing in the past, but this is cleaner.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.040
Use this.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.400
Look, if you could say, let's mock out date time.date time.now, or you could use FreezeGun.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.220
Like, which do you want to do?

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:14.580
Come on.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.080
Exactly.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:15.660
Yeah.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.140
FreezeGun.

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.520
All right.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.480
We've got one more that's on your list and then an extra one I threw in at the end.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.480
pytest-check.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:21.980
Yeah.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:26.140
I wrote a plugin called pytest-check and solved a problem I had.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:34.140
So the problem is the normal way to stop or to fail a test is to use assert or raise an exception.

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.220
Both of those stop the execution.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.300
I wanted to be able to do lots of things.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:44.580
Like if I want to test lots of attributes of some object, I want to be able to have a lot of things.

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.740
I want to have lots of checks in there.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.840
And I want to see all of the failures, not just the first one.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:54.660
So pytest-check solves this by allowing multiple failures per test with these little check functions.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:46:06.220
But you can also, it also provides a context manager so that you can say within this context, you know, you can use normal asserts, but within a context that will continue after that context.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:11.900
So a similar solution is available called subtests and with the pytest SubTest plugin.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:18.620
But I still like pytest-check better because it works with stop on fail and X fail, whereas subtests do not.

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:18.960
Okay.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.940
Yeah, this is really cool.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:28.080
So you can pass in a check fixture to your test and you can say check greater AB less than or equal to this.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.100
This is not in that.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:30.720
This is not in that.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.700
And then it'll tell you like it was not greater and it's not in there as the error.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.560
It's just something like that, right?

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.040
It's a fairly simple thing.

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.180
It's a fixture that just collects failure.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:45.560
It like wraps things right with an assert context manager or a try except block.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.920
And if a failure happens, it just, instead of stopping the test, it records it into a list.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:57.040
And then after the test is complete, it'll like kind of hack with the pytest guts to make it fail.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:57.400
Okay.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.300
That's really cool.

00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.540
I definitely like this.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:08.180
I'm thinking like if I get just the text printout of the build failed or the CI failed, you know, even, you know, that I just see it.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:15.720
And then when I'm running it and like PyCharm or something, I'd like to just look at it and go, oh, it failed because if this is true and that's true and this,

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:24.140
like I see, right, you don't have to go and actually debug through it or be, it might be that there's enough information here to actually know what's going on and just fix it.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:24.360
Yep.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:31.800
And also just more information is good sometimes dealing with, I mean, I definitely use it a lot with test equipment, with signal processing and stuff.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.940
A signal might be wrong, but why is the signal wrong?

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.860
It might be the wrong frequency.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:37.900
It might be the wrong bandwidth.

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.640
It might be, I mean, lots of different things.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:46.040
And if I'm checking four or five attributes of the signal, I really want all of that information for a failure.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:46.900
Yeah, I agree.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.060
There might be different aspects that all come together to make it successful.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.700
So report all the aspects.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:51.940
Yeah.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:52.780
That's cool.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:53.440
All right.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:48:00.780
I want to throw one more in that's not really part of pytest per se, but absolutely can be used with pytest because, hey, it raises exceptions.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.260
And that's called fluent check.

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:14.060
So this one allows you to use a, well, a fluent API, you know, where you say operation one dot operation two dot operation three to have a more English language thing.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:19.840
And to me, it feels a little bit like your check as well, but it's not a pytest plugin or fixture.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.780
So it has a couple of APIs.

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:23.840
I like the is API.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:33.700
So you can say like is in dot not none dot float dot between zero and one, and it'll actually check all those things and report like nice messages.

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:41.180
Like if it's not a float, it would say, you know, whatever it is, here's its value is not a float and you expected it to be right.

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.480
So a little more readable.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.740
Some people like it.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.160
Some people just want to assert stuff and either one's fine.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.200
But if you like the style, this is a pretty cool library.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.960
It's not mine, but I did do some PRs.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.220
I did basically create the is API for it.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:54.560
Cool.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.080
Does it have not a hot dog?

00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:02.020
It should also have is a teapot or something like that from the for web testing, you know, the four for 18.

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.320
Yeah, we should throw some of those in there.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:05.860
Like, why not?

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:06.320
We do it.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:12.980
Anyway, those are kind of fun for just like inside your test expressing what you're testing a little bit better.

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.340
I think check is really cool as well.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.320
And it's a bit similar.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.660
Yeah, but this one doesn't stop.

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.980
It just throws the first one.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:19.600
All right.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.660
Well, that's a great, a great list.

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.440
You know, maybe just really quick, we could check in.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.420
How's your book doing?

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.140
You wrote a book about some of the stuff.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:26.560
Yeah.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.700
So I wrote Python testing with pytest.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:36.020
That was gosh, it was it's been a couple of years now that it's been out and it's still going going strong.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:43.880
The of course, the big chunk of sales right after the book was released and quite a few during beta too.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:44.460
And that was neat.

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:47.280
But it's still selling really well.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.740
And I'm really happy with it.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.480
And it's still valid, even though it's it's a couple of years old now.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:50:01.720
And I wrote it in conjunction with talking with a lot of the pytest core maintainers to make sure I wasn't putting anything in there that would be deprecated soon.

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:02.420
Yeah.

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:04.520
So it's still valid.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.020
It's good.

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:05.340
Awesome.

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:05.640
Yeah.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.600
People can take that up.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.640
They want to read, you know, dive into this much more.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:13.780
And then also you did an episode that also talked about pytest plugins over on testing code.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:14.120
Yeah.

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.740
It was episode 104 with Anthony Sotil.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:23.740
The episode that you and I just did, we kind of picked our own, some of our favorites, some of the things that we think people should know about.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:30.000
What we did with episode 104, we took download counts and took the top some of the top 28 downloads.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:30.520
I see.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.340
Popular by usage, not by curation.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:33.900
Yeah.

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:34.360
Yep.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:34.820
Exactly.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:35.680
Awesome.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.640
All right.

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.540
Well, this is really fun, Brian.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.440
But before we get out of here, two final questions as per usual.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.180
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:43.700
PyCharm.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.160
All right.

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:44.460
Right on.

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.200
It's got some sweet built-in test runners.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:46.560
Yeah.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.880
It's really clean with testing.

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.280
Yep.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.960
And then notable PyPI package.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.680
I mean, I guess many of these are.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.640
Anything in particular comes to mind you want to throw out there?

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.620
It's something different.

00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:00.440
I'm kind of a huge fan of Flit for packaging.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.320
So that's the easiest way to package right now, I think.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:04.660
All right.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:12.700
As opposed to some of the other alternatives like pip and PMP and setup tools and all those

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:13.120
things, right?

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.160
Yeah.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:14.380
Yeah.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:14.660
Sweet.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.300
All right.

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:15.680
Yeah.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.000
What is that?

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.180
There's poetry and...

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:17.360
Yeah.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.400
Poetry as well.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:18.860
That's right.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.140
All right.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.360
Well, final call to action.

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.700
People are excited about pytest and pytest plugins.

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:24.700
What should they do?

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.060
They should buy my book, actually.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:31.780
So one of the things I made sure to do is to tell people how to create their own plugins

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:32.640
within the book.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.100
So I think it's a really good introduction to that.

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:43.560
Also, I guess, final call to action, go subscribe to Testing Code and podcast also and test your

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:43.760
code.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.600
Go out and test something.

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.680
Do you guys talk about pytests over there sometimes?

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.360
Sometimes.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:47.700
Yeah.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:48.840
A lot of times we do.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.940
Yeah.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.760
That's great.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:51.180
Awesome.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:52.280
Cool.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.640

Thank you.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:55.980
You bet.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:56.180
Bye.
