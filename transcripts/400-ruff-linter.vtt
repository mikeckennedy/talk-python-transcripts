Our code quality tools, linters, test frameworks, and others, play an important role in keeping our code error-free and conforming to the rules our teams have chosen.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.060
But when these tools become sluggish and slow down development, we often avoid running them or even turn them off.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.140
On this episode, we have Charlie Marsh here to introduce Ruff, a fast Python linter written in Rust.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:29.160
To give you a sense of what he means by fast, common Python linters can take 30 to 60 seconds to lint the CPython codebase.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.580
Ruff takes 300 milliseconds.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:39.300
I ran it on the 20,000 lines of Python code for our courses web app at Talk Python Training, and it was instantaneous.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.440
With that kind of speed, it's the kind of tool that can change how you work.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.980
I hope you're excited to learn about Ruff.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.520

Charlie, welcome to Talk Python to me.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.180
Thanks so much.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.520
It's my pleasure to be here.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.380
Yeah, it's a pleasure to have you.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.780
I'm going to talk about making Python code fast.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.400
Built some pretty interesting tools here with Ruff.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.820
We'll see about integrating Rust into Ruff, and there's a lot of cool tools around this

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.360
sort of code quality side of things, right?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.960
Like Black took off in ways, I think, even though Lukash didn't maybe imagine it would take off,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.180
and this is kind of in that same realm, and of course, it plays well with Black along the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.560
way as well.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.300
So we'll get to talk all about those things.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.760
It's going to be tons of fun to dig into them, but before we get to it, let's start with

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.120
your story.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.760
How did you get into programming in Python and Rust?

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.420
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.060
So I got into programming, I guess, the summer before I went to college, when I guess I was

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.440
supposed to be doing something fun.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.280
I taught myself Java, and it was the sort of thing that a lot of people had told me I would

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.340
like, but I never really had a chance to dig into.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.500
I ended up, I went to school, majored in computer science, so I did a bunch of internships while

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.440
I was in college.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.120
And then when I, my sort of junior year internship and my first year out of school, I worked at

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.680
a company called Khan Academy, which is like an education technology company.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.020
And at the time, this is less true now, but at the time they were a really big Python

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.360
child.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.940
I mean, they had one of the biggest like App Engine deployments.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.800
It was like Khan Academy and like Snapchat and like a couple other, maybe Spotify or someone.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.240
Wow, I had no idea.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.040
I mean, I'm just, yeah, I'm obviously I'm familiar with Khan Academy, K-H-A-N, I'm sure a lot of

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.420
people are.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.620
Yeah.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.440
But I didn't realize that one, they were such a GCP customer and that was Python.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.740
Yes.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.560
Was that Flask or Django on GCP or what was it?

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.760
It was like Flask on App Engine.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.340
Yeah.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.140
We did not use Django.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.480
Yeah.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.640
But they actually, I mean, it's a whole nother story, but they did a big Go rewrite after

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.360
I left, which is also super interesting.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.580
I mean, it's not Python, but it is still very interesting.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.240
Just like migrating a system from any language to any other language is always pretty interesting.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.840
But at Khan Academy, yeah, you know, I did some Python.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.560
I would say that like I mostly did web and we can talk a little bit more about this because

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.960
like really through my career, I've kind of jumped between a lot of different ecosystems.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.540
And so like at Khan Academy, I did, I think a year of Android.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.800
And did a little bit of iOS, did a lot of web, did a little bit of Python.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.300
And then most recently, I worked at a company called Spring Discovery, which is like a computational

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.420
biotech company.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.660
And everything we were doing was based on computer vision.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.220
So we'd like take really high resolution pictures of cells and then try to model like the way

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.580
that they change when you add drugs.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.920
Wow.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.340
Okay.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.940
Which is, yeah, it's pretty wild.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.600
I mean, I came into that with no bio background.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.400
I joined as like second engineer and build out a lot of our like data and machine learning

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.880
platform.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.620
That was kind of a crash course in building like a massive system in Python, right?

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.040
We were doing scientific computing.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.740
So it made a lot of use Python.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.440
So we ended up using Python for like almost everything.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.780
Yeah.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.120
Yeah.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.280
Python is a really good choice for the web, but it's like the de facto choice for data

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.960
science, right?

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.580
Like it's.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.940
Yes.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.780
Yeah, exactly.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.320
There's not a whole lot of other choices.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.360
Whereas on the web, there's, you know, five or six other platforms and languages that are

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.820
also contenders for that space.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.660
Right, right.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.980
So, you know, we built out what I consider to be like a fairly large Python code base.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.180
It was like a big monorepo.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.300
And, you know, I spent four or five years, you know, building that out and like really writing

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.520
a lot of Python every day.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.080
That's where like a lot of my Python experience comes from.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.700
And like that experience specifically also informed a lot of, a lot of growth.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.680
And, you know, I can talk more about sort of how those experiences intertwined, but that's

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.740
kind of my Python background.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.880
It must have been really fun to explore some of this visualizing cells and interacting with,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.340
you know, microscopes and.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.000
That was amazing.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.540
Yeah.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.280
All those kinds of things.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.480
Yeah.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.100
The coolest part of the job was just that if you bucket it like really crudely, like a

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.960
third of our team were sort of like software engineers or like data scientists, machine

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.780
learning researchers, and then, you know, a third were, you know, wet lab biologists,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.000
PhDs.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.440
And so every day I was like working directly with scientists and like building software for

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.280
scientists, which was just like a super cool thing to be able to do as part of a small team.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.620
Yeah.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.620
But yeah, wrote a lot of Python.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.980
That's awesome.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:03.920
I worked at a place that was a bunch of PhD researchers doing eye tracking, like not Apple,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.120
but your actual eyes.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.120
Like, what are you looking at?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.720
wrote the software to actually control the device and get all the information off of

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.440
it and then like analyze that and put, you know, generate like reports for the scientists

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.800
and stuff.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.160
And it's, there's a, there's a special kind of cool for software that touches like reality,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.840
right?

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.240
Yeah.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.220
I mean, it adds a lot of complication.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.880
Of course it does.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.420
It's very cool.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.800
You don't get exact numbers.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.480
You want to test it like, you got to approximate all the things, but still, yeah, that sounds

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.460
like a super fun job.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.100
How did it inform rough?

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.640
Like what are some of the experiences that?

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.360
Yeah, totally.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.180
Just so people know rough is like a super fast linter.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.860
Just give us the quick elevator pitch.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.620
So they, they, they know what the heck rough is.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.740
We'll dive more into it later.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.140
Sure.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.740
Yeah.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.000
Yeah.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.340
So rough is what I call an extremely fast Python linter.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.260
If you've used linters and Python in the past, you've probably used something like play gate

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.740
or pilot, or maybe like PI code style, you know, maybe use other tools to help manage your code

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:07.300
style, like black or like auto peppy, all this stuff that deals with effectively code style.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.240
So rough is a linter.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.000
It looks at your source code and it tries to report back and tell you a sort of flag and

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.280
tell you about issues with it.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.280
And those could be stylistic issues.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.320
Like this variable name is not great, or they could be, you know, like logical issues.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.180
Like you reference a variable here and that isn't defined.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:25.560
Right.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.860
I think there's a lot that distinguishes rough, but like the thing that I think caught

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.960
a lot of people's attention was just how fast it is.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.500
So I sort of hate benchmarks, like, cause no matter how much time you like put into a benchmark,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.740
like it's always wrong from like a certain perspective and like people always complain about

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.900
them, but I think rough is comfortably like somewhere in 10 to a hundred times faster.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.480
Some people even say like a thousand times faster on their setup.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.680
So it can be like really, really dramatically faster.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.580
And it can also do a lot of auto fixing, which is kind of a distinctive feature that I don't

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.160
know that many other tools.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.120
And there are certainly tools that do code transformation in Python, but like Pylon and

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.080
Flake 8 and such don't do this.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.220
So for lots of the errors that Ruff will flag, it can actually fix the code for you and fix

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.640
the issue for you, which is a big time saver.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.760
I don't know if this is one of them, but just to give people an idea, like one of the errors

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:20.140
or warnings rather that it'll give you is you have an F string, but you're not leveraging

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.400
its F string capabilities, right?

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.380
I'll just say F quote, and then it has just static text, a little.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.280
Literal string.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.800
So it doesn't need the F, right?

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.760
Theoretically, you could say auto fix and just it drops the F for you.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.320
It's like, yeah, you don't need that, right?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:33.640
Yeah.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.440
And, you know, we can also like go the other direction.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:42.740
So like if you're doing a bunch of like percent string formatting or using like the dot format

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.640
style helpers, we're actually, we can fix at least one of those right now.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.660
And strings are really complicated, but like we can actually rewrite, I think the dot format

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.680
calls into strings, which is cool.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:54.460
Fantastic.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.680
You know, another thing we can do is we can kind of keep your code like modern in a way.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.720
We've taken a lot of inspiration from other tools like Pi Upgrade 2 has like so much cool

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.320
stuff and functionality in it if you haven't seen it.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.280
And we take some of the rules from Pi Upgrade and basically re-implement them in Rust and package

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.680
them into a single interface and a single tool.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:20.420
So you just install one thing and you get, you know, 370 something rules.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.160
I can assert that it is indeed fast.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:29.920
We'll dive into it a little bit later, but I ran it on Talk Python training, the courses

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.620
website that I have.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.080
And I think that's got 20,000 lines of Python and it's instant.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.120
It's like you press enter and then out, you know, the stuff is just printing out.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.720
These are the things that found, which is pretty awesome.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.260
So back to your data science work.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:44.660
Yeah, yeah.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.840
How are you, what you're doing influence your creation of RUF?

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.680
Like why not just use Flake 8 or something like that?

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.880
You know, like I said, I'd like worked in a lot of other ecosystems where, with sort of

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.340
like stricter languages, right?

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.080
Like Java and whatever else.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.660
And it's not to say those ecosystems are better, but I often come at the stuff from a perspective

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.640
of wanting a lot of like static analysis tooling.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.960
So we had like a really heavily typed code base.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:15.620
We used, like we used mypy, you know, we used Black, we used Flake 8, we used Eyesore, we

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.080
used, I don't know, like doc formatter.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.660
There's like a lot of different stuff that we used.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:19.900
Yeah.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.620
You know, really my job was like, I was the maintainer of this big system.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.160
And like most of, like a lot of people in the team were effectively like clients of that

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.560
code base.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.220
So they were kind of like using the stuff that, you know, I and some others were building

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.180
as like a library.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.440
And so I had to maintain like this really big system.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.580
And like the more static tools you have, you know, in my opinion, it just like greatly

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.200
increases the leverage that you can have as a maintainer.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.840
So we use a lot of tooling.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.360
And I think like a couple of things happened.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.540
One, you know, I was spending a lot of my time in Python, but I was also doing a lot of

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:51.840
web.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.160
And so, you know, like one week I'd be doing Python, the next I'd be going and doing like

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.320
React and TypeScript and whatever else.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:04.000
And so people complain a lot about web tooling and like, you know, there are certainly lots

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.140
of valid complaints about it.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.940
But there's been a lot of interesting innovation, I think, in that space.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.300
And I was certainly influenced by some of it, just seeing some of the tools that came out

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.480
and how fast they were.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:14.740
Sure.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.740
And the fact that a lot of those tools were not being written in JavaScript sort of intentionally

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.640
to make them super performant was pretty interesting to me.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.940
So like, I don't know, I don't want to like name drop a bunch of tools, but you know, in

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:30.260
the web ecosystem, more tooling is being written in like Go, Rust, even some other sort of more

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.520
out there languages like Zig.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.540
And to me, that was kind of an interesting thing.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.760
It was like, well, does the Python tooling have to be written in Python?

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.860
Like what does, like, why does that have to be the case?

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.840
And like, what does it buy you and what do you lose?

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.960
So that was one thing.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.920
The other was we actually started to do a lot of Rust Python hybrid stuff in our own code base.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.660
You know, our code base was fully Python.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:56.060
And over time, we took some of the like really performance critical pieces and started to

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:03.140
rewrite them in Rust and expose them to the Python side using some of these like really great

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.040
Rust Python hybrid tools that, you know, maybe we'll get into later.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.180
So like one example is we were dealing with image data.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:14.340
So like a common thing we had to do is just like download a lot of image files, like really,

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:14.980
really fast.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.280
Right.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.160
And so, you know, we wrote that in Python.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.160
We wrote like a bunch of versions that use all sorts of like multiprocessing, threading,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.060
and like we tried everything.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.340
And then eventually we like rewrote it in Rust.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:29.280
And so we had a really simple, you know, Rust module that would just download files really

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:29.640
fast.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.800
And then we exposed that as a Python API.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.980
So like from the Python code, it just looked like Python, but the actual code that was running

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.760
and the way it was, you know, built and executed all went through Rust.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.160
Right.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.220
So you have these big data, big, let's say big computation problems where you're like, you

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.280
know, this could be better.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.780
The same time you're looking at this happening on the web side, you know, web pack or whatever

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.140
it is.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.000
And it's like, this is way better.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.860
We can do this in Python, but we aren't.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.860
So let's start, right?

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.960
Probably you got a little experience there and you're like, what else can I build with Rust

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.840
now that I know how?

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:01.040
Yeah.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.440
I was seeing, you know, the way that this innovation was happening in the web.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.140
I was seeing specifically the Rust Python like opportunity from what we were doing.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:14.180
And then I was, you know, frankly, like feeling a fair amount of frustration just with the

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.040
performance of a lot of the existing tools.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.000
Like, I don't know.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.360
I'm always really careful with how I talk about this stuff because I hate being, I'm

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.480
really like not a hater.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.920
And like, I've actually gotten like so much value out of like all of those tools.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.240
But I was being like, well, should it really take like one to two minutes to let my code,

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.420
like couldn't it be much faster?

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:33.820
Right.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.920
Like it's like a big code base.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.720
And like, as you add more plugins and everything else, it really like changes, like how you

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.660
feel about the tool.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.000
Right.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.960
Like it's no longer like something I just run and get feedback.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.540
It's like, oh, I have to run the linter now.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.580
Oh, I have to run the blah blah blah.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.400
And I was sort of craving that.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:49.640
Yeah.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:55.280
And if you're doing it on a team, my experience at least has been some people in the team continue

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.280
to run it because they find more value than stress.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.700
And others are like, eh, I'm not running that stupid thing.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.260
But then their problems get pushed onto the people who still care.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.820
And so then it creates this kind of like a tension, like Joe's code is always kind of crappy

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.740
because he won't lent it.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.040
But then like when I check out his code, my stuff starts reporting.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:18.100
You know, like those are the weird dynamics that happen from tools that are like super slow

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:23.500
unit tests or super slow linting or those types of things where certain people stop working

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.780
with them and others don't.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.820
And then you get these weird tensions.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.260
So having it fast, there's like real value to that.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:35.840
This portion of Talk Python Nemy is brought to you by Cox Automotive.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:42.380

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.840
Thank you to Cox Automotive for sponsoring the show.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.080
I left spring and like mid to late August.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.240
I started working on Ruff along with like a couple other projects and I never built a linter

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:22.700
before.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.220
It was sick.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:28.400
So like I didn't, yeah, I didn't really know what I was doing, but it felt maybe this is

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.860
like a little bit of hubris or not, I guess, because like it seems to be working.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.760
But like I was kind of like, I'll start with a linter because it feels like a tractable

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.460
like scope of problem.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.880
I was like, type checker.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.340
I know that's hard and like I don't really know much about it.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:42.820
A linter.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.040
I feel like I can learn like some of the concepts.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.120
I have a good understanding of like of like how it might work.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.120
To me, when I look at it, I think linting people's code, like abstract syntax trees and

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:52.320
stuff.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.260
I'm like, that doesn't sound like a problem to me.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.760
But it's good that you saw it that way because you did get through it.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.000
Yeah.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.660
Well, the first version I released was like very limited.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.640
It was sort of, I sort of needed to get it out because I wasn't sure that people would

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.940
actually really care that much about like what I was doing.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.240
Yeah.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.000
Because like I've described to you a lot of like pain points.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.800
They're also sort of like opinion, right?

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.420
But like, you know, I wasn't like a fast forward linter.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.420
Like who cares?

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.940
Was sort of, I wasn't sure.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.240
Yeah.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.780
So, you know, when I released it, I was like, I want to prove it's possible.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.880
I want to like have reasonable confidence that the performance won't get worse or much

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.120
worse as I expand it.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.700
But I only supported like, I don't know, maybe like 20 rules, which was fine with me because

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.220
I was really trying to prove a point more than, you know, get people to adopt it even.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:37.620
Right.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:43.700
Well, and a lot of times go into that experience, even if very few people used it, you learn fantastic

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.860
things, right?

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:45.200
Yeah.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.300
I learned so much.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.320
And I read a ton of code.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.280
Like I read all, I've read like a lot of, I've read like a lot of source code now.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:01.040
So I've read like all of like, you know, PyFlakes, like high doc style, high code style, like, you

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.280
know, because I've spent time like trying to re-implement a lot of those, a lot of those rules

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.080
and like understand how they do things.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.320
And you just learn a lot from like reading and trying stuff.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:09.520
Yeah.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.820
Rust is sort of like a whole nother thing where, you know, I did some Rust at Spring,

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.960
but I would say that building Rust was really like my Rust learning experience.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:23.480
I think I had to kind of try to build something from scratch to like really understand the language.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:23.860
Sure.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.940
Everything I did in Spring.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.260
You can do all the tutorials.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:26.820
Yeah.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.360
And I was like, I was trying to get in and out as quickly as possible.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.020
No, no.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.860
I just like, you know, I didn't do the initial Rust migration at Spring.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.020
I worked with another like super talented engineer who did that.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.300
And so every time I went into, you know, and I made a bunch of changes to it, but every

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.580
time I was going in and out, I was like, I just need to like ship this and like move on.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.260
Like, I'm not going to spend a bunch of time like really understanding everything that's

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:49.820
going on here.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.880
I just want to get it to work.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:56.380
And so I needed to like sit down and like really like focus and be presented with like

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.720
a blank plate, I think to learn and just like fail a lot and like build stuff that didn't

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.120
compile.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.520
Right.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.340
And figure out how to resolve those problems.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.960
It's honestly, it's a tough, it is a tough learning curve.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.880
I'm sure that it is.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.400
I started out in C++ and so I, I know there are harder languages and they're easier languages.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.040
So I've never written C++.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.140
I'm never.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.240
You're not missing that much.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:18.700
I would say.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.900
Eddie out there says rough is so awesome.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.300
I actually changed all the switch statements in my Python 310 code back to if else blocks

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.440
so I could switch to rough, which is pretty awesome.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.060
That's super nice and slightly embarrassing because we don't support Matt.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.980
We don't support Matt.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.160
We don't support the match.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.140
That's the one big language feature that we don't support yet.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.420
You could just kind of comment it out.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.880
Like it just, we're going to just ignore whatever's in the switch.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.660
It must be fine.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.620
On to the next part.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.320
Yeah, exactly.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:44.840
Right.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.900
Yeah.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.200
Yeah.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:46.520
Yeah.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.080
I mean, not for your code, but for linting.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.580
Let's start our dive in with this comment from Tyler.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.220
He says, what are the differences between linters like rough and flake gate?

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.600
Those versus code stylers or formatters like black.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.880
And maybe rough lives in the middle of that spectrum.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.460
I'm not sure.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.220
Yeah.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:07.300
There's certainly like, like, like you said, it's like a spectrum, right?

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.740
So I guess there's a couple of different ways to think about it.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:14.160
And it, with those tools specifically, like some of the responsibilities have like in my

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.880
mind, at least shifted a bit over time.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.380
So for example, like flake gate, it does a lot of, it doesn't change your code at all.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.260
And it'll just tell you about issues.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.460
And those issues could be style issues.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.180
Like you have extra white space here or.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:27.620
Yeah.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.160
I don't know.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.220
What's another big example.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.500
This line is too long.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:30.780
Yeah.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.120
Yeah.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.620
But it could also be like a logical issue, which is something that black wouldn't touch.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.140
So it might be like this import is unused.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:43.220
So on the one end you have like, you know, different collections of rules and maybe not really

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.200
changing the code, just kind of telling you about it.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.980
Black is different in that black just reformats your code.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.020
So it does, it's not actually aware of like the logic in the code.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.240
Like it doesn't know that an imports unused.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.380
It doesn't know that function is never called.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:57.780
Yeah.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.760
It just takes, you know, that abstract.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.500
Well, not, not exactly the abstract syntax tree, but it basically preserves your code as

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.200
is and just tries to restyle it.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.640
And so, you know, it's interesting because like if you use black, you probably don't need

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.460
a lot of style linting.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.820
Like if you're using black to format your code, a lot of the rules.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.920
Like a part that relevant anymore.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.140
They'll say something like you should have followed the rules of this, but black automatically

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.360
follows those rules for you.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:22.560
Right.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.980
So they're kind of, you don't need to correct the line length because black will wrap it

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.180
because that's what black does.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.280
Right.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:28.560
Yeah.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:33.060
Or even like, you know, if you have like X equals one with like no spaces between the

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:37.460
X and the equals and the equals and the one, like the linter will yell at you for that.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.020
But black fixes that for you.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.740
So a lot of people will turn off those rules.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.180
You know, this is why I say the responsibilities have shifted a bit over time.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:45.520
Yeah.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.300
I think you're right.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.460
That rough, like it kind of sits in the middle.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.620
We do less stylistic linting for this exact reason.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.520
Like I use black a lot.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.440
Black is like immensely popular.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:01.920
So I actually like strong, like heavily deprioritized, like all of the stylistic rules that are made

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.920
redundant by black.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.160
Okay.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.680
The difference is we do do a lot of that automatic fixing.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.840
So like we'll, we can remove unused imports for you.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.660
We can even do like a lot of more complicated rewrites.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.800
Like if you're using, if you're using like a dictionary constructor, like the actual, you

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.520
know, D I C T parentheses arguments, we can actually rewrite as a literal.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.180
If you have the rules enabled and you want to do that, you know, there's like a bunch of

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.620
rules around like comprehensions and literals, and we can do those rewrites too.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:33.520
So, you know, it does, it can do like style and reformatting, but it's somewhere in the

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:33.680
middle.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:33.960
Yeah.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.540
The fact that it makes some changes, but it doesn't go completely all in like black is

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.660
kind of why I think it lives a little bit in the middle there.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:40.960
Yeah.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:46.520
One of the things that I think might give people a lot of, brought a lot of faith or a willingness

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:52.840
to give it a try is there's a lot of projects out here that are large projects that people

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:58.320
would know that have adopted, actively adopted and started using rough.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.960
I saw a quote from Sebastian Ramirez from FastAPI right now in the audience.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:10.020
We have Olfek says the next release of hatch, which I hope to do this weekend will have

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:14.420
all the new projects generated with config for a Linting environment that uses rough, which

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.580
I think is pretty excellent.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.160
Can we speak to speak to some of that, like about these, these projects adopting it and

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.460
how that's helped you?

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.280
Yeah, totally.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:22.820
Yeah.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:27.300
I never expected that like this, maybe that like goes without saying, I think you'd have

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.240
to be like super arrogant to release something and expect a bunch of these people to use it.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.660
Yeah.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.500
It's been kind of wild.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:37.560
You know, initially there were a couple big projects that I would call like really early

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.660
adopters and they helped shape the project a lot.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.600
like Pydantic was a very early adopter.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.740
Zulip was a very early adopter.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.820
FastAPI was actually like a pretty early adopter too.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.160
Okay.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.440
And then like Pandas and Airflow and stuff, those kind of are more recent.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:55.760
Okay.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:01.240
It's been a very interesting, like to reflect on how that's happened because on the one hand,

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.360
it's like sort of ridiculous that all these products would migrate over because I'm on,

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.760
I don't even really have like a proper versioning system right now.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.940
Like I'm on V00225 or something.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:18.900
I basically release like every day and I consider like, I don't really make, we've made like

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.560
very few breaking changes, but like in theory we could make breaking change.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.200
I don't want to, but like if you have Scribe December, like we could make changes like that.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.740
You know, there's not really like docs, like the docs are just like this huge read me.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.320
It's kind of wild, right?

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.160
We don't support like all the Python 3.10 features, right?

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.100
We don't support match statements.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.120
So on the one hand, it's kind of wild that all these projects would move over.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.140
I think there are a couple of things that help a lot.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:48.020
So one is that the entire time I've been like very, very focused on compatibility with existing

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:48.440
tools.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.140
And that comes at a lot of cost.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.020
Like if there are things that I like don't agree with, right?

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:57.360
Or whatever else, like I sometimes still support them or implement them.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.960
And, you know, but the upside is like, it's very easy for people to migrate.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.320
Right.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.440
It might change nothing potentially.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.040
Right.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.200
It just, it just goes faster.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:06.820
Hopefully.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.860
And over time, like, you know, we don't have like a third party plugin system.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.060
We've just like implemented everything like in Rust, like as part of Rust.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:20.320
I viewed that as like, I'm just going to look at the most popular plugins and the most important

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:20.780
rules.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.300
And I'm just going to figure out like, what's a blocker for whom?

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.280
And like, what do I need to implement in order to like unblock people and like make sure

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:28.900
they can use it?

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.900
Is there a way for people to let you know which of those are really important to them?

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.920
Like, for example, if there's some big project out there, it's like, we would love to move

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.180
to rough, but there's this one, one plugin we're waiting on.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:41.740
Yeah.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.760
I mostly hear about it in issues.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.340
And there are a couple issues where it's like kind of a big GitHub issue.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.940
It'll be like implement this plugin.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.080
And a lot of people will come and like give it a thumbs up or whatever.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.340
We have pretty good coverage now, actually.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.040
Like, I mean, there is a long tail.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.580
Like there's a big ecosystem of like flaky plugins.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.040
You know, sometimes someone will come along and ask for a plugin that I haven't really like

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:06.620
seen before.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.660
And then it's just a calculus of like, what do I want to prioritize?

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.520
How much work is it?

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.400
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.560
Is this a super easy thing to do?

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.020
Like, oh, the line is too long.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.540
That's easy.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.920
Or is it, you know, rewrite this?

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.380
Yeah.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.180
This generator in this other interesting way.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:23.440
Yeah.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.220
That happened with, well, a lot of people want like, I don't know how to pronounce this library,

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.780
but like Dargland, like D-Argland, Dargland.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.420
I don't know.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:31.780
Anyway.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:32.780
I would go with that as well.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:32.980
Yeah.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.280
Yeah.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:33.600
Dargland.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.160
Let's go with that.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.960
It's very popular, but I've looked at the source.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.760
It's pretty complicated.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.320
So like, I need to, you know, that's not something I can just like turn around in a day.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.060
But like, you know, I hear like what people want.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:47.580
And I mean, some of those migrations though, I didn't even know about them until they'd happened.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.000
Yeah.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.180
Yeah.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:48.540
Of course.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.020
People come, they submit issues.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.060
I look at their profiles.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.200
I see what they're working on.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.940
I get a sense for what the projects are.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:54.220
Right.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:59.200
So sometimes I know, and then I'm kind of fixing things knowing that hopefully it's unblocking

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.160
them in different ways.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.860
But I think, like I said, I think the compatibility piece is like really huge.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:08.900
And I actually think that like black and eyesword and like the popularity of those things has

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.920
made compatibility for me like a little bit easier because I can just like adhere to what

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.340
they do.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.220
And then hopefully there's like no code changes.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:16.600
Yeah.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.120
They centralize around what like black is the truth.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.840
And then we'll, then we'll stop.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.860
We'll debate beyond that.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:27.260
But like, we're just going to accept black because it's no fun to go commas on the end

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:27.660
of the line.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.660
No commas on the trailing thing in the list.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.860
You know, like that, those kinds of debates just go on and on.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.260
Yeah.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:33.640
I know.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.320
I think black kind of solves that by just making a decision for you and not everyone's

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.500
totally happy with every choice, but it stops the debate.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.620
And that actually probably wins the day for most of them.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:48.900
One thing that's interesting here that I'm noticing about these projects in the large open

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:54.400
source projects that have adopted rough, not all of them, surely, but many of them like

00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.100
Pydantic and Polars and so on themselves are adopting Rust.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.300
Do you see a synergy of those?

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:07.340
Like, well, we're rewriting Pydantic core and Rust like Samuel Colvin is, or the folks behind

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.940
Polars are like, that's the core of it is about Rust.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.640
And that's the RS on the end, I think.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.720
So there might be a little extra draw there, right?

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.220
I think it's just more like, like spiritual alignment.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.180
Yes, exactly.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.280
Because it doesn't matter.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.060
No, it doesn't.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.900
But spiritually.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.660
But there's, yeah, there's a little bit of a bug.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.900
Sorry, bug in the sense of like, like once people start writing some stuff in Rust and

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.060
improving their Python, they're kind of like more open to like, you know, trying out other

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.220
things that are written in Rust and so on.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:44.680
So it's, I mean, that community has like been very interesting to sort of watch and be a

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.600
part of the like Rust Python community.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:52.660
It still feels like pretty nascent, but there are, the tooling is actually like really great.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:57.200
And, you know, we could talk about that more, but like, you know, there was definitely like

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:03.080
a bunch of initial setup for actually like distributing Rust, PyPI and making pip installable.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.620
But now that that's over, it all like just works.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:10.480
And I mean, I wouldn't say it's like requires no effort, but it's actually pretty amazing.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.600
Like how, like the degree of integration and how much you can do now with these tools like

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.540
Py03 and, and MatcherIn and some others.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.340
That was one of the things that was really nice surprise for me as well as how easy it is to

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.280
install, right?

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:29.080
Like, unless you told me, unless it wasn't part of, you know, the elevator pitch, you know,

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:34.920
the little one sentence subtitle on the project, like you would know from a interacting perspective,

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.960
which is kind of exactly what you want.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.960
I also think that it's really, there's some value to having these popular projects adopt

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.700
RUF because Martin and the audience, for example, says, I found out about Ruff by looking to see

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:51.680
what FastAPI does, because presumably it's a ton of respect for FastAPI and Sebastian, his choices.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.080
So yeah, it's got to sort of create the snowball effect as well.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:02.340
So this portion of Talk Python to me is brought to you by user interviews.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:08.120
As a developer, how often do you find yourself talking back to products and services that you use?

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.920
Sometimes it may be frustration over how it's working poorly.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.800
And if they just did such and such, it would work better.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.140
And it's easy to do.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.040
Other times it might be delight.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.240
Wow, they auto-filled that section for me.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.620
How did they even do that?

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.040
Wonderful.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.680
Thanks.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.780
While this verbalization might be great to get the thoughts out of your head,

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.400
did you know that you can earn money for your feedback on real products?

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:36.820
User interviews connects researchers with professionals that want to participate in research studies.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:42.640
There is a high demand for developers to share their opinions on products being created for developers.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.260
Aside from the extra cash, you'll talk to people building products in your space.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.140
You will not only learn about new tools being created,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.380
but you'll also shape the future of the products that we all use.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:58.320
It's completely free to sign up and you can apply to your first study in under five minutes.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.620
The average study pays over $60.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:07.620
However, many studies specifically interested in developers pay several hundreds of dollars for a one-on-one interview.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.840
Are you ready to earn extra income from sharing your expert opinion?

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.760
Head over to talkpython.fm/user interviews to participate today.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.060
The link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.600
Thank you to user interviews for supporting the show.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:34.400
One thing that's a little bit overlooked about why that adoption is useful is that it actually feeds back into the project in so many great ways.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:48.240
So, you know, for example, DAG sir adopted ROUGH and they have a really big Python monorepo with 50 or 100 separate Python modules or packages in there.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:54.360
And they filed like a bunch of issues about around how can we make ROUGH better for monorepos.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:32:00.420
And so now they can run ROUGH once and it runs over all their separate projects that can all have their own configuration.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.460
And that's like a really, really powerful thing.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:11.300
And something that like if I was just sort of sitting around like building ROUGH, like I don't know that I would have known to prioritize that or what it should look like.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:20.300
And so like actually like working with people who want to adopt ROUGHs and like figuring out what stops using it provides a ton of value to the project and just prioritization.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.560
Like a lot of the iSort stuff, I pushed on it a lot when I started because ROUGH does import sorting.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.320
So you can use it if you want in lieu of iSort.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:33.020
And we implement a lot of the same configuration options, not all the same.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.040
iSort just is like really configurable.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.980
So we went, we sort of implement them as they get requested.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:46.320
But anyway, I prioritize that stuff because a lot of people wanted it and they were coming to the issues and being like, hey, this would really help me adopt it, blah, blah, blah.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:52.300
So just like getting the feedback and like hearing what's blocking people, like that itself is like so valuable for the project.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:52.620
Right.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.860
And you have a lot of people involved in these larger projects.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.380
So they, and they have specific polished needs, right?

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:05.460
Like there's a lot of people who work on pandas or FastAPI and those are mature code bases.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.020
It's not just a pet project, right?

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:07.540
Yeah.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.100
Yeah.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:08.860
Those are very mature.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.240
Yeah.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.660
Yeah, exactly.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.100
That's good.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.180
But also it's a challenge.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:18.800
One other thing I would like to point out, you know, you started off by introducing rough saying, maybe people will be interested.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.080
I don't really know if they will.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.640
Maybe they will.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.300
That'd be cool.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.600
You know, 6.5, 6.4 thousand stars.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.560
That's a, it's a non-trivial amount of interest.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.840
That's a lot of love.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.440
Yeah.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.240
Yeah.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:30.620
Yeah.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.060
And like, I don't know.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.220
One thing that I, I guess I might feel weird, like highlighting all the big projects.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:41.240
Cause one thing that I really appreciate is just like anyone who's willing to try a tool

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:41.860
like this.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.180
Sure.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.240
Like moving tools and trying new tools is like a big decision.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.640
I just like really appreciate everyone who says nice things about it or everyone who's

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.660
like willing to give a try, give it a try, like no matter what they're working on.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:53.880
Yeah.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.880
It's not a platform to say that out loud.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.020
So hopefully people hear it.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.040
Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:03.760
So the other thing I want to highlight about the repo here, not just the stars, but when

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.360
I look at a project and I want to sort of assess, I really want to adopt this thing.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.440
Do I want to make this part of my dependencies or things or layers that I got to live with

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:13.680
here?

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:19.300
And if it goes sideways, I got to change something is, you know, how old is the project?

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.900
How active is the project?

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.720
And so on.

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:26.060
So look, we started this podcast 40 minutes ago.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.880
The last commit was 52 minutes ago.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.300
Oh yeah.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:30.920
Sorry.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.480
Yeah.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.200
It's kind of.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:32.740
That's awesome.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:36.160
I mean, you're like, but you're looking here and it's then it's, it's yesterday.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.620
It's, it's last week.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.080
I want to point out there's just a lot of activity, 78 contributors.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.920
It's a very lively project and not just something that's cool, but you know, there's a lot of interest

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.080
and energy in it, which I think is a very strong signal that it's something people should

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.160
be comfortable adopting.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:52.460
Thanks.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.400
I appreciate you calling that out.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.720
I think I guess companies one, that's actually something that when I talked before about

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.240
why would these big projects adopt this thing that like seems really experimental, that's

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.020
actually something that comes up a lot is, and I'm not in the conversation, but obviously

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.680
I'm sleuthing a little bit on the PRs.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:09.940
Right.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:14.360
And they're saying, well, it doesn't support X, but it's like really actively developed.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.260
And I'm like very confident that they will support that, you know, at some point.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:19.140
Yeah.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:24.500
And so like, just like having something that is clearly very actively worked on, I think

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.720
is quite like appealing and comforting to people.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:26.980
Yeah.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.660
I actually like do feel bad saying this, but like one of my favorite, not favorite, but

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:38.400
it kind of an interaction that happens on the repo is someone will file an issue and they'll

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:44.180
say, this is actually also a bug that exists in the, let's call it the upstream implementation.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.240
So the existing Python version of that tool also has that bug.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:48.300
Right.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.520
Like Pyland or FlickAids or something like that.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:50.780
Yeah.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.820
It does this, but we think it's wrong.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.700
We disagree with it or something, right?

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.360
Or there's an issue where, you know, the maintainer is like, oh yeah, this is broken.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:58.780
Yeah.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:58.940
Yeah.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:35:59.140
Okay.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:02.960
It's really not like the reason I tell that thing is like, I, you know, every project is

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.940
different and like every maintainer, like most people, like everyone's doing this like

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.720
for free, right?

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.780
Like I'm not, I'm not here to like call out other maintainers, but I think it's a very satisfying

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.940
interaction for people when, you know, they link to an issue it's been open for, for maybe

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.700
for like years.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.880
And then I can actually just like fix it in like, like pretty quickly and ship a release

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.540
in the same day.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:27.420
And like that, I think that's like a really like powerful thing that resonates with people

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:27.800
a lot.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.460
It's just the feeling of like stuff getting shipped and like things getting fixed.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.540
And yeah, I'm like, you know, I'm working on this full time.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.300
So like, I'm fortunate to be able to do that.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:41.720
And like, I totally get it that like other projects are in different states and stuff.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.940
But I get a lot of, you know, and people are always super appreciative.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.440
And so it all just like funnels into, you know, giving me energy.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.920
Eddie has called you a commit machine.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.800
Literally every time I update my project dependencies, I'm guaranteed to see new stuff on Ruff, a new

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.280
version of Ruff.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.140
I appreciate that.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.160
You know, it's, I do appreciate that.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.140
Like, yeah, I do try to write a lot of code, but you know, it's obviously not just, not just

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.920
me and like the contributors, the contributors have been awesome.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.860
And I think, I mean, one thing I'm particularly impressed by is just the number of, number of

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.580
people who, like, I don't even know if I always believe them when they say this, but like

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:21.340
just the number of people who are like, this is my first time writing Rust or like, I'm

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.880
really not good at Rust or like, blah, blah, blah.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.920
And hear something amazing.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:25.940
Yeah.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.780
And they just like make like great contribution.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.740
They're like, Hey, I'm trying to learn Rust.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.640
And I obviously love that stuff.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.560
Like for interested in learning Rust, I actually think Ruff is like a great, a great project

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.760
and like a great place for that.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.340
But I mean, there are people who are working on stuff, especially the stuff that I just

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.660
like, it's like big things I can't like focus all my time on and just like having great

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:50.280
contributors who are like really, you know, like thoughtful and like prolific.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.780
Every project is lucky to have people like that.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.780
How old is the project?

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.020
When did you start it?

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:55.820
In August.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.100
Yeah.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.260
So it's not that old.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.120
My brain is like melting, but it's somewhere.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:37:59.580
Yeah.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.380
I think it's like, like somewhere between four and six months.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:02.840
Okay.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.120
Did you say you're working on this full time as like your full time job?

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:06.420
Yeah.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:06.760
Okay.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.000
And so how's that work?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.600
Is that GitHub sponsors or are you employed by someone to completely work out?

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.160
What's the story?

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:13.780
That sounds awesome.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.180
Still figuring out, you know, I'll probably share more on that soon.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:17.540
Okay.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.200
I don't know if sponsors enabled right now.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.580
Still figuring out exactly what, like how I want that all to evolve.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:22.880
Right.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.000
I am working on it full time.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.740
I don't anticipate that changing in any way.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:31.200
Like I, I'm really happy in getting so much out of this and yeah, I think there are a lot

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.100
of ways to make it work.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.480
And if not rough, I want to be working on like other Python tooling.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.740
So, you know, I think there's like more stuff to come.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.280
Well, it certainly is neat tooling.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.920
Let's go, let's go through the GitHub page here a little bit.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.660
So we've talked about the speed a couple of times.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.900
We talked about ways in which that happens.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:52.020
You know, Rust is an important part, but it sounds like it's not the only reason that it's

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:52.440
fast.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:58.420
You have a chart with the obvious like a little asterisk caveat benchmarks.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.240
It's reproducible, you know, like all the stuff's in the readme, but yeah.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.080
That's fast in this situation, but my situation is different in which case, you know, such

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:07.480
and such.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:07.740
Right.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:16.980
But for some large code base, we've got rough in 0.3 seconds, autoflake at six, pylint at

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.780
over 60 seconds, just barely.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:23.320
This is on the CPython code base from scratch, which is pretty ridiculous.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.560
And I already told you the numbers.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:31.840
I don't have a millisecond number, but it appears to be instant on 20,000 lines of Python code

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.340
that I wrote.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.520
And it found some issues, which I thought would already be discovered.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.840
So that's pretty excellent.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.340
Nice.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.420
It's nearly Python 3.11 100% compatible, right?

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:46.200
You said the one major language feature is the match statement, but other than that, it's

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:46.940
compatible, right?

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.260
Correct.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:47.880
Yeah.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.180
Okay.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:52.960
It supports some of the other language features like that are maybe less high profile, like

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.980
the parenthesized width statements and stuff like that.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.100
But it doesn't support the pattern of structural pattern matching yet.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:39:59.620
Got it.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:04.740
So it's got the autofix support near parity with the Flake 8 rule set, which is cool.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:11.380
You talked about the way that you keep the performance fast, but still have parity with Flake 8 is

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.640
you have native re-implementations of the Flake 8 plugins.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.100
That's right.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:15.320
Yeah.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.000
So we re-implement everything in Rust.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.540
And a lot of the time, that's like me or whoever's working on it, like looking actually at the plugin and

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.080
like the logic it uses and trying to mimic that in a high fidelity way.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:39.540
And often we'll like try to use the same test suite and really try to make sure that we're compatible, except in cases where we think there is like an actual sort of factual error.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:39.820
Yeah.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.540
Why rough is fast?

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:50.880
The plugin stuff, there's a lot of interesting stuff to say about like plugins, because I think Rust is a big part of why rough is fast.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.640
But there are a couple of other big pieces.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:59.580
So we take a lot of care in the code base to like only do necessary work, if that makes sense.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:07.880
So, you know, we support 300 something rules, but depending on which exact rules you have enabled, we'll skip a lot of unnecessary work.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.160
Okay.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.400
That can help a lot.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.720
So, you know, it's basically tailored to how much you're using it.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:16.600
So like if you're not using it as an import sorter, you know, there's a bunch of stuff that we get.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.920
It's just how I would think about it.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:24.060
But the other like really big one is because everything is sort of implemented in like one system.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:30.720
There's a lot of work that would normally be duplicated between a lot of different tools that can actually just be done once.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:40.320
So the way to think of that is like if you look at like flake 8 with flake 8 doc strings, there's maybe one example which uses PyDoc style.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.480
Sorry, I know it's like a huge like a tree of tools.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.320
You know, if you add that plug in.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.160
So PyFlakes is going to parse your source code and turn that into an AST.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:56.040
And then PyDoc style actually has basically its own parser that will go back over the source code and look at all the tokens and extract the doc string.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:01.680
And if you have a bunch of different tools, like some of them will share that abstract syntax tree.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.960
But a lot of them end up doing work that other tools are also doing.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:12.640
Right, because they can't count on necessarily that being done or the plug in system doesn't provide work that's already been done to them.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.160
So they got to start over anyway. Right.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.320
Yeah. Or they might want to do things in like a slightly different maybe you have like three different plugins.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:24.240
Like I guess one example is a lot of plugins like need some way to tell if a function is like public or private.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:28.720
And it's not like super complicated, but you know, it's not like totally trivial.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.240
Like you need to account for functions that are in inside of classes.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.640
Like is it a public method or private method to account for functions that are inside of other functions.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:41.360
Right. So there's like a lot of rules actually for like determining what's like public and private.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:46.080
And, you know, you might have one lint rule that's like all public methods need to have doc string.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:50.800
And you might have another rule that's like all public methods need to have type in two things.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:57.840
And if you have two separate plugins that are doing that, they both need a way to actually like extract that information.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:03.840
And, you know, it's not necessarily the case that like it'll be way faster to do it with one pass and one.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.880
I think it will. It may not be like or as magnitude.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:11.760
But the other thing is you have a lot of like consistency. So like, you know, it's defined in one way.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:16.160
You're not going to be at the whims of like small decisions that the tools have to make.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.840
For us as like maintainers and like building rough, you know, there's a lot of stuff you like don't have to implement multiple times.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.240
Right.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.880
I can leverage that and like go and implement other lint rules.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.800
And I don't have to like figure out from scratch, how do I determine like what public and private in it?

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:33.120
How do I like extract all the doc strings from a file? Like we already have all that infrastructure.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:38.000
So there's kind of like economies of scale, I guess, to like implementing new stuff.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.760
Like it sort of snowballs a little bit, like the tool gets more powerful, it gets kind of easier to do things.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.360
I mean, I think you'd be surprised like how much of building a tool.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:52.640
I don't know about you personally, but like I was surprised by like how much of building a tool like this is just done.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:58.640
It's like settings and like configuration and like how do people express their settings?

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.480
What is the command line interface look like?

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.120
How do you find all the Python files in a directory?

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:09.040
Like it sounds trivial, but like, you also want to respect like getting more is do you want users to be able to ignore files?

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.320
Like there's a lot of rules.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:15.840
And so again, it's like if I look at a new Python tool, you know, that wants to go off and implement something,

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.760
they might have to implement all that stuff themselves.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.680
But for us, it's like we have all that infrastructure in place.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:27.360
And so if we want to build a new fun piece of functionality, it's just sort of defining the rule and we get all this other stuff for free.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.600
Yeah, you can definitely build on the layers that are in place because it's all together.

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:31.840
That's cool.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.080
Yeah.

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.000
All right, let's look through here a little bit.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:43.040
Like I said, there's the testimonials from the different projects like Brian from Bokeh or Sebastian from FastAPI and whatnot there.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.760
But let's start with installing it.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.920
Like I said, you would know that this wasn't just a Python tool you could use.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.840
Pip install rough. That's the way to go.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.000
But when I installed it, I didn't pip install.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.560
I pip x installed it.

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.600
Are you a fan of pip x?

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.960
Yeah, I use pip x.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.240
Yeah, to me, it seems like rough is something I want to run on different projects.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.200
And I just kind of want rough in my tool set.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.080
And so I pip x installed rough.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:08.640
What do you think?

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.280
Good idea.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.720
Is it better to put it, say, like in a per version of per project?

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.600
Like everything.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.040
I think it probably depends.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:15.840
Yeah.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.520
I mean, I definitely saw a lot of stuff at pip x.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:25.440
I think the one thing that I, the one issue with rough, and I guess I recognize wines can be annoying for some people, for sure.

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.800
Like we released a lot.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:36.880
And so if projects don't pin their dependencies, then they can start to see like new errors as we add new rules, which I guess in some sense is like a breaking change.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.720
But I don't really consider it as such.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:47.120
It's like, you know, they have the like, let's say they have the like, like a simplify rule set enabled and we add a new rule and that gets turned on for them.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:55.200
So anyway, the point is like people, I guess I recommend pinning rough if you're using it for a project, which I mean, with pip x, you're just going to stay on one burger.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:55.520
Right.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.680
So you run pip x, you upgrade dash all or whatever, or upgrade that thing.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.720
Yeah, exactly.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.760
It's doing it to a sense.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:06.480
It's kind of a pin, but it's pinned globally and it gets upgraded globally and that not, not per project.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:06.800
Yeah.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.120
Yeah.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:07.360
Yeah.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.400
For me, that's kind of okay.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.520
But if I was on a large team, you know, lots of people who were working on it, you might want to control that more.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.080
I can see that.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:20.160
We have a homebrew distribution and a condo distribution on condo forage.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:25.040
And then I did those and then there's everything else was done by other people.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.800
So I'm like, which is cool, but most of me, I'm like less familiar with them.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.200
Yeah, sure.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.160
I mean, I don't know.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.760
Publishing on homebrew and condo forage was like pretty interesting experience for me.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.720
I've never done that and I didn't actually really know that.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.680
much about how those worked.

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.560
I think so.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:38.880
Yeah.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.880
Yeah.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.280
That was cool.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.600
Hopefully it's useful for people.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.640
There's definitely some complexity with like the packaging and release stuff, which I don't

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.760
know if you want to talk about that or not, but you know, because we're building Rust, there's

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.920
like a couple of things that we need to do that are a little different from a standard Python package.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.000
Maybe just touch on it a bit because what you deliver is a wheel, right?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.720
But it's got the compiled Rust bit for me on my ARM 64 macOS build, right?

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.680
Yeah, that's right.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.560
Yeah, that's right.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:11.760
So basically it just means we have to do the wheel in some sort of pre-compiled version of

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.560
the package as opposed to just giving you the source code.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.960
And like if I just gave you the source code and not the wheel, you'd actually need to have

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:23.680
Rust installed because you'd have to actually build the thing and install it, which is of course

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.280
an extremely unreasonable expectation for the kind of people who are using this for the most part.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.520
Yeah, but before the wheels really became popular, that was part of the step, right?

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.040
It would build for you.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.520
Yeah.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:35.920
Yeah.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.120
Or it wouldn't build for you, which was frustrating, but that was part of the step, right?

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:39.520
Yeah.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:39.920
Yeah.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.920
We just build wheels for all the platforms that I know of.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.640
It's not something.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.680
Is it all CI/CD?

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.320
You just push it to some branch and magic happens and then wheels start appearing in places.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.320
Whenever I cut a release on GitHub, like I just use like GitHub releases, basically.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.240
I just use GitHub releases.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.120
It kicks off our release job and then that's all through GitHub

00:47:59.120 --> 00:47:59.600
action.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.760
So it just has a big matrix, right?

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.680
Of all the different operating systems.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:09.280
We only have to build, thankfully, we only have to build one wheel per operating system.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.280
We don't have to build one wheel per Python version, which is something that can happen sometimes.

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.320
And then you have like a mass explosion of number of wheels.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:21.680
That's all facilitated with a tool called Maturin, which I'm a big fan of, which is,

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.000
it's sort of like, I don't know, like set up tools and a bunch of other stuff bundled together,

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.040
but specifically for shipping mixed Rust Python.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:33.520
So I don't actually have to like do anything for the host part to make that work.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:33.840
Yeah.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:40.480
My pyproject.tomol has, you know, Maturin at the top and I have a Rust project and I call

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.640
Maturin build and it creates a wheel.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.240
It's all like, I don't know.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.360
I think it's like super cool.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:45.760
That works.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.120
Yeah, that sounds super smooth and super neat.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:49.680
Yeah.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.280
And like I said, as a consumer of it, also very smooth, right?

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.640
It was still quickly.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.160
I didn't have to wait on some build.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.840
I didn't need build tools or config that I don't care about or don't use.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:05.760
I'm pretty sure I do have Rust, Rust C as a CLI option I can use here, but you know,

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.880
you don't want to depend on that, right?

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.280
No.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:13.120
So you run it on the command line, you say rough and you point at either a file or a directory

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.760
or some pattern of files, right?

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:15.760
Yep.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.480
Star type of thing, which is cool.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.080
And that gives you the output.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:25.680
You can also do it with a --watch and just run it constantly, which is pretty cool,

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:25.680
right?

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.400
It's fast enough that basically as you save it, if there's problems that'll just appear

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.920
in the terminal, right?

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:32.800
Or wherever you run it.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.880
That's kind of a funny example because I based, or it's a good example because I,

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:43.040
I'm pretty sure I took that exactly from probably from TSC, which is the TypeScript compiler.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:43.760
Yeah.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.400
They have a watch setting and I like how it works.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:51.280
And so I wanted that for, so it's just a, that's a very literal example of me looking at

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.120
another tool from like another space and being like, oh, that's really nice.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.280
And I wish you had that other tools like it too.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:57.600
Yeah.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.480
I suppose it's terrible and not terribly difficult to implement, right?

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:06.160
You take the pattern and you put a watch in the OS watch implementation and you say,

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.200
call me back when something changes and because it's fast, it just reruns, right?

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:09.840
But it's still,

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.120
Yeah, it's exactly right.

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.360
It's very handy though, that, that it's there.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:18.640
The other thing that's interesting is you can do it as a pre commit hook, which is nice.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.120
Yeah.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.800
That works pretty well for people.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.800
I think a lot of people seem to use it.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.840
I'm glad that it exists.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:24.240
Yeah.

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.120
A little bit of a weird setup because maybe it's actually not that interesting to talk

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:31.760
about, but it's in like a separate repo for sort of like, I can't even really remember.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.160
Okay.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.000
Interesting.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.680
Now to configure it, it has a, let's say comprehensive CLI set of options.

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.320
I can't remember maybe 15 or so command line options.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:48.560
You can pass it, but you can also put, put it into the pyproject.toml with things just

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:51.360
like tool.rough and then you can put your various settings in there.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:51.760
Right.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:57.360
So it just sort of integrates along that, or you can have a rough.toml and then put it in there.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:57.840
Yeah.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.880
So that's something that I took basically from hatch.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:06.480
So within hatch, you can have a pyproject.toml or a hatch.toml and the hatch.toml kind of like

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.720
tests the configuration.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.360
Like if you use a rough.toml, you don't need to have like tool.rough at the top and stuff like that.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:13.680
Yeah.

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:21.360
I think one thing that I'm quite happy that we have is like the configuration is very like type safe.

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:26.960
So if you try to like, you know, so that, that line select equals EF, those are like error,

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.200
like rule codes that are defined in rough.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:34.640
And so if you put, if you replaced F with some string that wasn't, you know, a real rule,

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.560
you'll get an error immediately saying that, you know, your pyproject.toml had invalid,

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.640
was invalid in like these ways, blah, blah, blah.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.200
Interesting.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:41.600
Okay.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:47.120
And similarly, we create what are called like JSON schemas or the configuration.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.040
If you're in PyCharm and you open up like a pyproject.toml and you type

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.160
tool.rough, it'll actually like show you all the options.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.920
It'll actually surface the documentation we have for the options too.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.480
Oh, nice.

00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:59.520
Which is pretty cool.

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.160
Yeah.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.440
I'd like more tools to do that.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.040
Cause I think it's like super useful.

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.880
I think poetry has it, but not too many others do.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:11.600
You can get it in VS Code as well, but you need to install an extension.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.600
It's called like even better.toml, I think.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:13.920
Right.

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:14.320
Okay.

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.920
But I'm happy with those things.

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.720
I think it makes it like, I think small things like that add up and glad we're able to do them.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.200
Yeah.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.280
When I looked at the configuration settings, like the exclude directories and various other

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.600
things, like that's kind of a lot to put on a command line.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.680
It would be nice if you could just put it and say rough.toml or pyproject.toml.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:35.680
And then when you just type rough the thing, it, it sees that and it uses it.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:35.920
Right.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:36.240
Yeah.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.320
I've kind of like intentionally like not put a lot of these arguments on the command line.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.560
Like for that reason, like you can imagine taking everything here and exposing it on the command

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:49.680
line, but the command line really just deals with like how should the thing execute and not like,

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.760
I don't know, what should the max complexity be?

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:51.760
Yeah.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.320
Yeah.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:52.320
Yeah.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:52.320
Yeah.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:52.720
Yeah.

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.960
I think that's fair.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.040
Like put the common stuff on the command line and then say, and if you need to go crazy,

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:03.280
here's your --config, pass that in and put it in there.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:03.600
Right.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:03.840
Yeah.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.000
Yeah.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.400
Yeah.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:04.400
Yeah.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.240
One thing that I did want to talk about and you kind of touched on, there's a bunch of the

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.120
command line arguments.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:12.400
One of the things I did want to talk about is the editor integration.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.080
There's a huge bunch of rules here.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.000
We got to scroll through on the homepage to get, get down to it, which is awesome.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.120
That are no, no, it's good.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.720
I mean, these are like all the things that checks that I don't have to think about anymore,

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:23.840
which is great.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:28.640
Eventually though, geez, I forgot it was this long.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:33.840
Eventually though it has plugins or maybe that's not quite what I said.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:40.560
It has a, an extension of a VS Code and it has ways to basically add it as a command

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.840
to PyCharm, right?

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:46.800
Which is, those are both awesome editors that are kind of very friendly to thinking about code

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.080
formatting and exposing the errors that this would as well.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:50.560
So that's great.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.480
You might want to just talk about that just real quick.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.200
Yeah, totally.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.040
So yeah, we have a VS Code extension.

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.440
That was my first time writing a VS Code extension.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:03.280
And actually the, these extensions use, or they conform to something called the language server protocol.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:08.240
And effectively that's sort of like a standard, I believe I'll probably get like a bunch of

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:12.560
the history wrong, but I believe it's Microsoft that like publishes and maintains that.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.280
It's that.

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:19.280
The nice thing about that protocol is you can actually use like the lot, like most, almost all

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:23.600
of the code behind the VS Code extension is actually published as a language server.

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.160
Yeah.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.040
Rough LSP.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:29.680
And what that means is you can actually get like the exact same behaviors in all sorts of different

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.240
editors.

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.000
It's not confined to VS Code.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:38.960
So if you use like NeoVim or like sublime text or whatever else, those all support this standard

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:44.080
protocol and they all have ways to tap into that rough language server protocol.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:51.120
So we have sort of like the standalone LSP, which we have instructions for like sublime and,

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.800
and you know, other tools.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.720
And then we have the actual extension, which is published on the marketplace.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.360
And those are things I definitely want to like keep supporting.

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.640
And I view them as like official arms, right?

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.720
Of the project, which I think is nice.

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.560
So people should know that like, you know, those are official and like, I pick bugs and

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.600
man, and all that kind of stuff.

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:09.840
Nice.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:15.200
And then for PyCharm, you just add it as an external tool and then you have the rough command

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:19.200
around or for both of these, if you prefer, you just add it as a pre-commit hook.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:19.440
Yeah.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:19.840
That's also.

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:20.080
Yeah.

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:20.480
That's right.

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:20.960
Yeah.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.880
That then like, as you interact with it, it'll run the pre-commit hook as well.

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.240
If you try to check things in.

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.600
Super cool here.

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.920
I think this is a neat project.

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:36.080
I ran it into my project and I thought, you know, everything is pretty much good to go.

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:42.480
Where, you know, when I'm using PyCharm, for example, it'll often tell me many of these things.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:47.520
Like it'll say there's a local variable that's unused or it'll automatically remove unused imports.

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:51.040
And yet I'm looking at 331 issues.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:55.840
108 are potentially fixable with the --fix option.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:00.160
So it sounds like there's still a lot of value to like make that part of my tool chain.

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:00.320
Yeah.

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:05.680
I mean, you know, and feel free to have some of your own opinions about which of those rules actually matter.

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:06.000
Sure.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.720
And I suspect you can disable them in your config file, right?

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.240
You can say this rule I don't care about.

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:10.640
Yeah.

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:12.640
And this is another sort of compatibility thing.

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:19.120
Like we, API for actually like turning rules on and off is like essentially identical to the flight gate API.

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.600
So that's also useful for people migrating over.

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.320
So the no QA, is it the like comment?

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:24.560
Yeah.

00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.080
Like comment no QA is one option.

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:26.560
Yeah.

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.200
We respect.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:27.520
Yep.

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.400
We respect those too.

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.760
We also respect like, I sorts action comments.

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:35.360
So yeah, we, we like do a lot of stuff to try and

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.320
maintain compatibility.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:36.720
Nice.

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:40.720
Maybe another like interesting thing in that vein is that we ship a tool called

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.040
flight gate to roughs, which does sort of what it sounds like.

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:50.080
So you point it to a flight gate configuration file and it spits out a Tommel for rough,

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.200
you know, that's compatible.

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.440
And it also tells you if there were things in the file that we don't support, which is useful too.

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.360
Like, oh, hey, you're using these rules.

00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.640
Those actually aren't implemented yet.

00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:58.880
Yeah.

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.880
That's also maintained as like part of the project.

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.880
So, you know, I recommend checking it out.

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.280
Excellent.

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:06.880
Well, Charlie, I think we're getting short on time, but not short on topic.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.880
There's a whole lot more to dive into.

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.880
I think it's, it's really cool project.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.160
I think it's new.

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:12.880
Are we gonna do a big WASM section?

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.120
No, I'm kidding.

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:15.520
I'm kidding.

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:16.640
We don't have time for that.

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.160
We could do a WASM section.

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:22.000
We even have some great chat GDP questions in the audience.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.120
I don't necessarily think that there's time for those, unfortunately,

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.680
but there is one final question that I want to ask.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.240
It's kind of inspired by the audience, but I think it's good for everyone.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:36.800
Jean Gabriel asks, is there a roadmap or timeline for rough development out there?

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.160
Like what's next basically?

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.360
Like, I guess the short answer is no, like there's not like a published

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:47.520
timeline, unfortunately, like most of this stuff exists in my head and in issues.

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.040
Like everything happens on issues.

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.040
Like we're just talking a lot on issues.

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:51.280
Yeah.

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.000
I'll maybe talk a bit about like the things that I'm thinking about.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:00.080
So one is fixing like the structural pattern matching issue.

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:06.240
And so like getting full like Python compatibility, which it's sort of like one bug, but then unlocks

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:10.560
us doing what I hope will be like a stable release, even if that's not that much changes.

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:14.160
And it's just kind of, you know, the marketing of it, but hopefully we'll fix that.

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.680
And then we can do like a stable release.

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.880
The, there are two other kind of big things on my mind.

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:23.040
So one is this is like a really big project, but not, not rough.

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:27.840
The thing I'm about to talk about, but, I want to extend rough to do like full code auto

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.120
formatting so that people could use it in lieu of black.

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:36.000
If they wanted to think it's like a really natural fit for what rough is doing.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.840
And a lot of people asked about it.

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:42.000
The way that that will, there's an issue where we talk about this, like on the repo, it's not

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.200
like some big secret reveal, but, the way that I think about that, like, like with all things is

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.400
I want it to be like, sort of incrementally adoptable.

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.400
Like right now you can use rough with ice or.

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:57.120
Or you can use just rough, or you can use rough to your input sorting, but like not as a linter.

00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.920
Like you can kind of pick and choose like what you want to use.

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.560
And I view like the auto formatter is the same way.

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:07.200
Like I fully expect that people will keep using rough and black, but it's just like the kind of

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:11.360
functionality that makes a lot of sense, given what we're already doing and like the way that the

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.480
project's evolving.

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.880
So I need to like, and you be careful because like, it's like that blog work.

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:21.040
And so I'm not like saying exactly when that will be done, but I do want to start working on it.

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.720
And then the other thing, which is maybe like a little bit less exciting to other people.

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:28.240
And it's like, you know, I think at some point I'd like rough to get to a world where

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.080
it kind of stands alone a little bit more.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:34.720
It isn't viewed quite as much as a compatibility as this compatibility layer.

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:39.360
Like right now, all the rules kind of map back to like, Hey, or other tools.

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.040
And when you're using rough, you're kind of thinking in the mindset of those other tools,

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:47.040
like what are the rules and how do I configure them at some point in the future?

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:51.840
I'd actually like, you know, rough to sort of have its own API, like own indexing of the rules.

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:55.520
And to view that as kind of a compatibility layer that will not go away.

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.080
Like this won't put a burden on users, but I'd like to get

00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:02.480
to get to a point where like conceptually, a lot of this stuff is like first class and rough.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:08.000
And it's not viewed as re-implementations of other extensions, which I think will enable us to do a lot of cool things.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.320
But I'm hopeful that I'm doing that in a way that has no disruption to users.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.960
So we'll continue to support the existing API and such.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.520
Yeah.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.160
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.280
Very exciting.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.080
Very exciting.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.200
Well, congratulations on a project that people seem to love.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.720
It's got a lot of traction and definitely doing some cool stuff.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.040
So before we get out of here, though, final two questions.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.720
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor are you using these days?

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.240
I use PyCharm for everything.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.600
And that includes Rust.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.120
But I do all my Rust and my Python and PyCharm.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.000
Nice.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.200
Is there a cool plugin that basically adds Rust support to?

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.800
Yeah, there's just an official IntelliJ Rust plugin.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.200
Got it.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:43.360
Nice.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:43.920
Works really well.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:50.320
I've used IntelliJ for that platform for Dart and Flutter, but I haven't tried to plug Rust into it.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.240
But yeah, it does a lot of things.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:52.880
Cool.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.280
And then notable PyPI package, something out there.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.960
You've named a couple that do the Rust integration nicely.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.240
But anything you want to give a shout out to?

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.600
Yeah, I really want to give a shout out.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.880
I've already mentioned it a few times.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:06.800
I think if you're interested in doing Rust Python stuff, you should really look at Matrin.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.280
Matrin.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:07.520
All right.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.680
M-A-T-U-R-I-N.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.120
It just makes the publishing really easy.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.520
And you still have to learn Rust, which is not easy.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.720
I mean, I do.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.720
It's worthwhile, I think, but it's not easy.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:23.440
But it makes the publishing Rust code to PyPI, or PyPI, sorry, really easy.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:23.840
Awesome.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.440
Well, great recommendation.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.480
Thanks for being here.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.200
Final call to action.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.320
People want to get started with Rust.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:28.960
What do you tell them?

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.960
The main thing that I would like to say is if you're interested in contributing,

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.080
even if you don't know that much Rust and are interested in learning,

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:42.000
I'd love to see you on the repo, and I hope it's a place that people feel really welcome

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.360
to come and contribute, even if they are 100% certain if their code is right or anything like that.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.000
So definitely really excited to have more contributors and have more people coming into the project.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.040
And of course, you should also try using it yourself.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:55.520
All right.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.000
Excellent.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.680
Well, thanks for being here.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.360
It was a great conversation with you.
