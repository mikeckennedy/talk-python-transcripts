00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.300
This past week, we've had a passing of the reins for Python leadership.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.760
Guido von Rossum, who created and has been shepherding the language for the last 30 years,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.200
has stepped down from decision-making around the Python language.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.900
Join Carol Willing and Brett Cannon, both longtime core developers and Python leaders,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.500
along with my co-host at Python Bytes, Brian Okken, as we discuss what the future holds for

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.020
Python and how this change will affect how Python is created and how it evolves.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.620
This is Talk Python To Me, episode 170, recorded July 17th, 2018.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:51.260
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.780
ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.920
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.920
Follow me on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.200
Keep up with the show and listen to past episodes at talkpython.fm, and follow the show on Twitter

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.380
via at Talk Python.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.980
This episode is sponsored by Linode and Rollbar.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.180
Please check out what they're offering during their segments.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.720
It really helps support the show.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.280
Hey, everyone.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.040
Michael here.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.600
Just want to add a quick editorial note before we get to the main content.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.120
This episode was originally recorded under Python Bytes, my other podcast that I do with Brian

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.420
Aukin.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.240
If you don't listen to Python Bytes, you should.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.080
It's pretty awesome.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.680
The format normally is cover a bunch of really quick topics to talk about the news of the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.900
week.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.660
Well, this news item was so big, we decided to dedicate a whole episode to it, and it's really

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.140
a good fit for Talk Python.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.220
And I wanted to make sure everybody got the whole story behind what's going on here, at

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.580
least as best as the four of us can present it.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.120
So what you're hearing today is the show that we recorded for Python Bytes also played in

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.600
Talk Python.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.900
If you haven't heard it over there, I think you'll really get a lot out of it.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.640
If you have, honestly, it's the same thing.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.380
Just a heads up.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.460
Thank you all for listening, and I hope you enjoy the show.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.580
And just one more time, thank you to Guido for everything he's done.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.620
It's been really amazing.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.040
Now let's get to the story.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.960
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.860
And Brian, we've got a really special episode for some big news here.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.780
Yes, and we've got some great guests helping us with this.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.300
We do.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.460
We have Carol Willing and Brett Cannon both joining us to get somewhat of an inside perspective

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.780
on this big, somewhat sad announcement.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.240
And we're going to dig into that.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.000
Hello, Carol.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.020
Welcome to the show.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.400
Hi.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.140
How are you doing?

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.800
Great.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.480
Thanks for being here.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.860
Hi, Brett.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.020
Hello, everyone.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.780
Thanks for having me.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.480
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.240
It's great you're here.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.760
Brian, you want to tell us what the big news is?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.080
I think I'm just about as clueless as everybody else.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.440
I'm just in shock.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.660
Last week, we heard an announcement that Guido was stepping down as the BDFL.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.460
Yeah, that is a big deal.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.080
So there's been a little bit of debate about exactly what he meant when he said this.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.600
You know, was it he's just taking a break?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.680
Is he actually stepping down?

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.080
So let me just read the salient parts of the announcement.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.880
So this was an email sent to the Python mailing list, Python dev mailing list.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.460
And the title was Transfer of Power.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.520
And here's Guido's words, bits and pieces taken from his email.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.320
Now that PEP 572 is done, I don't ever want to have to fight so hard for a PEP and find

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.260
that so many people despise my decisions.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.200
I'd like to remove myself entirely from the decision process.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.220
I'll still be here for a while as an ordinary core dev, and I'll still be available to mentor

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.560
people, possibly more available.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.180
But I'm basically giving myself a permanent vacation from being BDFL.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.660
And you all will be on your own.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.700
I'm not going to appoint a successor.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.820
The decision, he says basically, summarizing that the day to day stuff is going to be fine.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.540
But the decisions that matter that may be affected are how PEPs are decided and how new

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.800
core devs are inducted.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.480
And then finally, sort of on the parting thought, said, I'll still be here, but I'm trying to

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.000
let you all figure something out for yourselves.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.740
I'm tired and need a very long break.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.740
So that was the announcement.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.680
And that's the big news.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.980
And that's what we're going to talk about today.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.240
And first, I just want to say thank you to Guido for doing so much for so long, creating

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.560
one of the most popular programming languages in history.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.640
I have publicly said this, like, I am personally forever indebted to Guido and the team, because

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.800
they basically taught me how to program for real.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.360
Like, I have an official education in all this, but I have always stated that how to actually

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.900
develop in the real world is entirely down to Guido and the team.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.260
Yeah.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.040
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.560
And I think, you know, Guido has done so much, not just for the language, but also for the

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.600
community as well.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.700
And I know I appreciate from the earliest days when he was designing Python, how he was

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.920
made it accessible for learners and for people to actually use the language.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.460
And, you know, when I'm teaching people, whether it's with Jupyter or high school students, like

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.540
I'm teaching this week, it's just a pleasure to do it in Python.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.960
And personally, I have a lot to thank him for, but even more so for the greater group of people

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.620
as well.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.920
Yeah.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.440
I don't know if he specifically set out to set the tone as he did, or if it was, it's just

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.220
Guido being Guido.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.240
But I think he definitely deserves a lot of credit for setting the tone that this community

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.620
has ended up with as being inclusive and welcoming and just basically what makes this community

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.680
as amazing as it is.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.980
Yeah.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.980
And it's not just technical.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.920
I think one of the special things about Python, unlike many languages, is they're sort of professional

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.180
programming languages that can build high-end stuff.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.600
And there's learning languages that are super basic, but you got to stop to go build real apps

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.000
with something else later.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And this is one of the few languages that you can start simple and finish big with.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.740
And so that is really, I think, part of its magic.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.080
But also, you know, you go to PyCon and these other conferences, and you look around, and the

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.300
people around you look like more like general society and less like a bunch of white guys.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.660
You know what I mean?

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.900
And to me, that is a really special thing.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.680
It really is.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.080
It's not as far as it should be, but it is on the path to where it's on a good path.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.240
It's unlike other communities that I've been involved in.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.980
So I think that's also really important.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.440
When I think Kim as a person, I think he has, his personality has so much to do with it.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.520
You mentioned PyCon, and one of the things that Ito did at PyCon was I had asked him if he would

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:30.800
meet a young man called Joshua Lowe, who does EduBlocks, which is this really cool user interface

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.420
that lets you go from scratch to Python code.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.020
And we were talking about how Joshua had made it over dinner.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:47.080
And then the next day, Guido probably spent an hour just hacking with him and made this

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.600
young man's PyCon experience more amazing than it was just the day before.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.840
That's really awesome.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.240
Yeah.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.180
And Brian, you got to have lunch with him at the last PyCon, right?

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.960
That was really fun.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.200
They did a drawing of people that donated to the Python Software Foundation.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:09.200
They drew a handful of names, and I think there were like six or seven of us have lunch with

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.360
him.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.300
And one of the things that was really interesting at that lunch was we were in around the table

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.920
and talked about what everybody does and what their contribution or not to Python was.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.560
And it talked about some of the things I was doing.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:31.980
I mentioned I have a full-time job, but I also work on trying to teach testing and pytest and

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.720
other development processes to people.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.520
And he looked at me and said, so you have got a full-time day job.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.720
How do you have enough energy to deal with all the negative feedback you get from contributing

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.240
to Python?

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.280
And I haven't really got that negative feedback.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.220
And I guess that was a bizarre...

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.260
I thought of it as a bizarre question, but now in context, it makes a lot of sense.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.000
He was at the center of the pressure points, right?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.980
That's tough.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.520
So let's maybe talk about what some of the root causes for this.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:10.900
Like, he specifically calls out Pep 572 in his letter that he sent out.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.540
But I feel like there must be more to that.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.460
Like, Pep 572 was the straw, not everything.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.780
But Carol and Brett, you guys are more on the inside.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.640
You probably have more exposure to this.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.720
What do you think?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.860
Honestly, it was the last straw.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.340
I don't know what Carol thinks, but I personally figured Guido was probably going to retire in

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.060
the next, I don't know, two, maybe three years.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.440
Just because he's joked so long about retirement.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.420
And I think he was just getting ready to just not do it.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:48.260
And he's been working on making the projects self-sustaining for quite some time.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.720
But admittedly, from my perspective, Pep 572 got really nasty.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:00.780
It was so much negativity that I think he just got fed up and said, like, look, I've been doing

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.640
this for 28 years.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.080
I've been putting up with general negativity as well.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.380
And this groundswell was just too much to bear and just like, forget it.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.080
I don't want to put up with this anymore.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.900
I'm going to, as he said, he's going to retire.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.060
He's still the BDFL.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.360
That for a life bit is true.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:22.020
But he's basically said, my last dictatorial declaration is I am not going to make any more

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.360
dictatorial declarations ever again.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.720
Have fun.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.600
Yeah.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.240
Yeah.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.820
But no, it got extremely negative.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.400
Like when Guido announced the acceptance of the Pep, the very first tweet at him was

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.060
too bad.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.000
It's a waste of time.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.040
And that was just a very common occurrence of just nothing but negativity.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.500
There wasn't constructive feedback or anything.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.280
And it dragged on forever.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.180
There were some missteps in terms of how it was communicated in terms of a technical aspect

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.600
of how it was communicated through the list, like reposting the Pep.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.600
But people just really just piled it on.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.460
And it was just unnecessary.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.040
It was just not constructive.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.140
And that's, as Brian pointed out, that's why he asked that question.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.120
How do you handle the negativity?

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.440
Because there can be a lot of negativity anytime you touch this language.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.020
People love it for a reason.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.360
And if there's any hints of you changing something that they don't like, some people really overreact.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:21.120
And if you saw my keynote at PyCon US, it was entirely on this topic because it can get

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.580
so overwhelming sometimes when people just jump on you and expect on a part of you so widely

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.080
as Python.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.620
There's not a small number of people who feel the need to share their opinion and unfortunately

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.960
share it in a unconstructive way.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.480
And I think it just finally made him just go, yeah, you know what?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.160
I don't need to ever put up with this ever again.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:40.720
Forget it.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.880
And just said, I'm retiring.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.980
One thought that I had when we were getting ready for this show was, you know, it's kind

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.220
of related to what Brian said as well.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.260
Like, you know, has a full-time hectic job at Dropbox, right?

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.960
He's already fully committed to working on stuff.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.700
And then he's trying to bear the, you know, significant portion of the weight of people

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.000
not wanting changes or demanding changes to Python in various ways.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.200
And, you know, do you, Carol, think it would have been different if the PSF had made a space

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:21.200
to sort of employ, you know, to be in that role and not make it, you know, there's the

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.860
stress of the experience and there's the stress of these are my final two hours of the day

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.860
and I'm already exhausted.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.220
Now I'm getting this.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:27.740
You know what I mean?

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.260
I can't speak for Guido, but I mean, I don't know that that would have solved it.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.880
I mean, I think he has been doing what he wants to be doing.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:41.560
And I think if he had said, hey, I want to do this, people would be, you know, very happy

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.740
to accommodate him.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:48.840
I think largely what Brett had said, you know, we were talking in the office here at Jupyter

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:54.680
the other day and we were saying, we can't believe how long he has shepherded

00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:02.240
the language and dealt with, you know, people's comments and fostered, you know, the direction

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:02.960
of the language.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:12.320
And in many ways, any maintainer will feel over time some burnout when there's negativity around

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.040
a project.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:21.000
And I think it's unfortunate that people choose to make things personal when they don't need

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.140
to be personal, that they view things with black and white as opposed to wanting to compromise

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.500
over something.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:35.200
And I remember when I was facing some burnout and he was one of the people that said to me,

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:41.680
well, do the things that you really enjoy, electronics and teaching and is really helpful

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.260
advice.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.280
So I think maybe he's taking some of his own advice.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.580
Yeah.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.380
It has been a really long time that he's been working on this.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:53.040
I've never worked on a single project for 30 years, right?

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.280
I've not been programming for 30 years, honestly.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.440
But it just seems like, you know, it's pretty natural for him to step down.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.460
One thing I really wish, and I, Brian, I think we spoke about this last time.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:09.340
I wish he would have just sort of gone into a more, just, I'm kind of stepping back for a

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:14.940
while and hung in there until after 2020 and Python 3 becomes the one and only Python.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.920
And sort of that could have been like a celebratory stepping down rather than a, I'm frustrated

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.740
and I'm giving you guys the reins.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.980
I would have liked to see him retire in some sort of celebration, mission accomplished type

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.060
of experience, you know?

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:33.760
It would have been nice, but the problem is, is there still the chance of another, I don't

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.740
think uprising is quite the right word, but an explosion of negativity between now and then.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:44.020
And while I would like to assume the community has switched over to three and every number I've

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.180
seen has said that.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:51.600
I also don't know if the people who are holding onto Python 2 are going to react reasonably

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.820
come January 1st, 2020 as well.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.960
So I could also see him going like, you know what?

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.920
I don't want to risk having to put myself through that after what he's just gone through.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.880
Yeah, that's possible.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.440
I totally get the perspective of it would have been an amazing party January 1st or at PyCon

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.840
in 2020 going like, yeah, we've moved on to Python 3.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.560
Guido's getting the well-deserved retirement he wants and it would have been an amazing party.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.980
But instead, we're just going to have just the amazing party for Python 3.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.680
And I'm personally fine with that.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.500
We can invite Guido.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.420
I'm sure he'll be there.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.120
I don't think that that.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.440
I mean, he's still the president of the PSF.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.800
So he obviously is still going to be involved.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.040
And, you know, it's up to us as the community.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.500
Much like the SciPy community did last week, they did a really nice thank you, Guido.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:47.380
Like they got everybody from the conference together and gave them a very thoughtful thank you, which I've never seen them do for anything before.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.000
So it was really cool.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.620
And I think he has touched so many people in so many different ways that that celebration will come.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:07.700
I think looking at it, I don't know that there's ever an easy way to change how you make decisions and governance when you have many personalities involved.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.740
And it's unfortunate how it came out.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:24.800
But I think there had to be something that would give us a catalyst in the developer community to really take some of these issues on that are not necessarily new issues to us.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.280
He's been asking us to do it for quite a while.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:33.600
And we just haven't either had the bandwidth or the sort of kick in the pants to actually go and do it.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.900
So we're all kind of like the 29-year-old kids still living at home.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.100
And Guido's like, get out.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.540
Go live on your own.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.320
Take care of yourselves.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.180
A little bit.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:41.540
Yeah.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.580
Yeah.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:48.080
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Linode.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.020
Are you looking for bulletproof hosting that's fast, simple, and incredibly affordable?

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:56.940
Look past that bookstore and check out Linode at talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.860
That's L-I-N-O-D-E.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.340
Plans start at just $5 a month for a dedicated server with a gig of RAM.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.860
They have 10 data centers across the globe.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.380
So no matter where you are, there's a data center near you.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:13.620
Whether you want to run your Python web app, host a private Git server, or file server,

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:23.740
you'll get native SSDs on all the machines, a newly upgraded 200-gigabit network, 24-7-friendly support, even on holidays, and a 7-day money-back guarantee.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.040
Do you need a little help with your infrastructure?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.300
They even offer professional services to help you get started with architecture, migrations, and more.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.380
Get a dedicated server for free for the next four months.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.220
Just visit talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.240
All right, so you spoke about governance and decision-making and stuff.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.760
What do you think is going to replace Guido being the final decider?

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.200
It's actually still being actively discussed.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.460
As the email Guido sent said, he's basically leaving it up to us.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.780
He did not dictate how we were going to govern ourselves afterwards.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.440
So he has left it up to us.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.820
He actually didn't even dictate how we would even choose how we would choose to govern ourselves.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.940
So there's not even a specific choice yet of how we would potentially vote for this.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.320
Like some people have said PSF fellows.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.240
Some have said core devs.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.180
So there's, it's a completely open-ended question, honestly.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:32.140
The current thinking seems to be around, and Carol can obviously correct me if my feeling doesn't jive with hers at all.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:39.100
Either potentially another BDFL or a somehow council of elders or some such.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:44.800
It seems to be the key thing is just trying to figure out how we want to steward the design of the language.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.600
We've been managing ourselves daily for quite some time.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.500
Guido's not directly involved with releases, so that's not even an issue.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.380
It really comes down to how do we have someone make the final decision on PEPs?

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.580
Who says yay or nay?

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.000
Who makes the technical decisions?

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.760
Who chooses the paint color for the bike shed?

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.860
That kind of thing.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.320
That's the really key thing we have to still make a decision on.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:23.160
Yeah, and I think Brett kind of put it, you know, I think the emails that I've at least seen on Python committers have been very respectful and, you know, really trying to seek out what is going to happen from here.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.620
And I think Guido's email mentioned four things.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:40.320
Day-to-day decisions on the issue tracker and GitHub, how PEPs are decided, which to me is sort of like the direction of the language and who stewards that, how new core devs are inducted, and the code of conduct.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:51.000
And if I look at all four of those, the day-to-day decisions, as Brett had said, you know, releases and things like that, we're in a good spot.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.260
And we should probably just be doing what we have been doing.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:19:02.380
How new core devs are inducted, I think that will fall out of whatever decision-making we have for the language.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:10.360
I know that we've made some progress over the past couple of years, and I continue to see that we will make progress.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:28.340
And the code of conduct, I think we're all recognizing that being professional and civil to each other and talking about issues as opposed to whether somebody's intelligence calls, it's called into question or whatever, is not the right way to do it.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.660
It's better to be professional.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:47.900
And, you know, how PEPs are decided, it seems as if, much like Brett had mentioned, that we're sort of converging on maybe three individuals as like a triumvirate or one and no more than five is sort of how I've read it.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.260
Okay.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.680
That makes a lot of sense.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.100
It seems to me whatever the decision is, it should be odd, not even.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.500
Actually, that came up already.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:02.980
And Tim Peters, for those of you who've been in the language for a long time, might recognize the name, who's gotten active again, partially thanks to PEP 572.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:08.080
So at least there's one very nice perk from my perspective from what happened with PEP 572.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:16.080
pointed out that the odd number in voting typically is very important when you have an either A or B decision and you have to choose one or the other.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:25.260
But if you have a status quo or a change, so more of a yes, no decision, having the tie go to the status quo is not quite so critical.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:32.020
So we could theoretically go with a four and really not have too much of an impactful problem in that regard.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.060
Yeah, I guess it would lead to stronger debates.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.340
You've got to bring someone over to your side if it's a split decision.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.860
And if they fail to decide, then it just stays the way it is.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.420
Right.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.920
Nothing new is adopted, I guess.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.520
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.960
So there is a possibility of actually going with four, for instance.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.760
Interesting.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.320
I don't think anyone suggested two.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.300
It seems to be pretty much one, three, four, five seems to be the running numbers right now.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:55.680
Right.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.220
Yeah.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:56.820
Interesting.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.160
Okay.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.380
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:06.360
So I guess the final thing that we should spend some time on is, is this a problem for the community?

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.780
Is this going to hurt Python's fantastic momentum?

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:16.780
Is this going to hurt the growth or evolution or sustaining Python?

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:22.520
Or do you think it's just a little bit of change on how decisions are made and not such a big deal?

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.020
Do you want me to take that first, Brett?

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:24.400
Yeah.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.220
Yeah, go ahead.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.240
You go first, Carol.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:31.540
So I think the language will continue to thrive and will continue to grow.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.300
Will some things be different?

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:33.760
Yes.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.880
But Guido's made it very clear.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.540
He's still going to be accessible on mailing lists.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.760
He's still the president of the PSF.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:49.320
The PSF is largely, with the community's support, doing many of the outreach things and things to grow the community.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:22:03.480
And then the core development side of things, I think what you've seen is sort of a shift in some ways away from strictly the language to also, you know, Python has a very rich ecosystem of libraries.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:13.840
So things like Jupyter and scipy and scipy wouldn't have come about if Python, the core language, hadn't been so wonderful to work with.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:20.960
And so, yes, there was going to be work to do to figure out how to continue the design of the language.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.420
But I have every belief and commitment that that will happen.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:26.980
I agree.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.240
I think the way I don't think this is going to change the momentum for the language.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.600
I don't think, honestly, anyone should really be worried at all.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:44.640
There might be a slowdown in terms of new features for Python 3.8, which I know some people actually like the idea of.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:52.220
Basically, I view it no more as a temporary pause in language-defining changes.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:23:00.220
And honestly, we've had a language moratorium before back for Python 3.3, I believe, which I should know since I helped write the PEP for that.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:10.000
So if anything, you can view it as basically just a moratorium on language changes for a little while until we decide how we want to govern those kinds of changes.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.820
And then it'll just more or less go back to where it was.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:26.840
Now, the pace might be slower than it was if, for instance, we go with a council versus another benevolent dictator who could potentially come to decisions faster and just do other things.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.160
I guess it's potentially more nimbly in my personal view.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:38.240
But I really don't see this really affecting the language long-term or even medium-term or basically short-term defending on your definition of short.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.220
Yeah, for some definition of short, yeah.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.560
I suspect we'll have this all worked out in the next few months.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:50.220
I'd be really surprised if we don't have a solid plan of what our options are by the end of the year and if not already decided by then.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.140
No, I've got hopefully a quick question.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:24:00.440
I guess I don't know how, when there's discussions on peps, who can participate in those discussions?

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.320
Is it just core developers or?

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.460
I have to caveat this with this was the way it used to be.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.180
We'll see if this continues.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:17.800
But to answer that question, Brian, basically the way we suggest people do peps is they come with an idea to Python ideas, the mailing list, and they propose it.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.440
And usually pretty quickly, people either go, that's been proposed before.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.100
No, that doesn't seem very Pythonic.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.800
Or that seems like a possibly good idea.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:37.280
And Guido did on occasion come in and say, yes, there's a possibility for this or would shut an idea down quickly so people didn't waste their time.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.460
And then usually they have a discussion, work out some rough details.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:47.500
And then usually the proposer goes away and comes back with a rough PEP saying, all right, here's a more formal proposal.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.460
And then more discussion on Python ideas to help that author refine it.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.360
And then what they would do is they would then bring that to Python dev.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.760
And then with more or less a finalized pep.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.600
And then any final salient details would be worked out.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:14.460
And then either Guido would name what we called a BDFL delegate, who would be someone he delegated the final decision to in terms of technical details and also whether the PEP would be accepted.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.880
Or he would keep the BDFL vote himself and he would eventually make the call.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:36.520
One change that has been floated, though, is to take a PEP from Python ideas to Python dev, you might start needing more of a co-sponsor from a core developer to help make sure that the idea seems solid enough to bring forward and also to make sure the PEP is in a good position.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:49.200
Because one of the problems with PEP 572 was while the idea was there, the PEP wasn't fully, fully fleshed out to the level that we typically have peps out from Python ideas on dev as.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:57.260
And so there was a lot of repetitious discussion of things that should have been recorded initially in the PEP to have tamped down on the repeated discussion.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:04.080
Because the discussion on Python ideas actually was a bit more reasonable than it was on Python dev and less reactionary, funny enough.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.540
So that's generally the process is idea to Python ideas, then a rough PEP and then refine it.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.860
And then once it's fairly refined, goes to Python dev, final discussion.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:22.300
And then either Guido or a named BFL delegate made a decision and the PEP either got accepted or rejected.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.600
And that's basically the way it was.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:30.800
This portion of Talk Python To Me has been brought to you by Rollbar.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.480
One of the frustrating things about being a developer is dealing with errors.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:43.480
Relying on users to report errors, digging through log files, trying to debug issues, or getting millions of alerts just flooding your inbox and ruining your day.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.240
With Rollbar's full stack error monitoring, you get the context, insight, and control you need to find and fix bugs faster.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.220
Adding Rollbar to your Python app is as easy as pip install Rollbar.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.460
You can start tracking production errors and deployments in eight minutes or less.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.640
Are you considering self-hosting tools for security or compliance reasons?

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.220
Then you should really check out Rollbar's compliant SaaS option.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.720
Get advanced security features and meet compliance without the hassle of self-hosting,

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:15.600
including HIPAA, ISO 27001, Privacy Shield, and more.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.960
They'd love to give you a demo.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.660
Give Rollbar a try today.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.360
Go to talkpython.fm/Rollbar and check them out.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:31.340
Is there a point in that process where the rest of the community can, I guess, add to the opinion?

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.640
So yes, Python Ideas is a completely open mailing list.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.140
Python Dev is also a completely open mailing list.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.680
So none of these discussions are happening behind closed doors at all.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:46.420
The only mailing list, honestly, that is in any way closed in any of this process is Python committers.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:52.240
And that is more technical details that only affect Python core developers themselves and not PEPs.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.740
So none of these discussions happen in such a fashion that outsiders, outsiders is a bad term.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:03.280
People who happen not to be core developers are always able to bring forward their opinion.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:17.120
The part of the trick, though, is not having people suddenly pop in and leave their opinion without checking what other people have said or coming in and not understanding how to be professional about leaving their opinion.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:26.580
So there's always a balancing act of trying to ask too widely of people who don't quite understand the norms of how to communicate well, honestly.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.120
But none of the conversation is closed off such that people can't participate.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:41.240
So, for instance, Brian, if we had a testing-oriented one, you're totally happy to come in and participate, whether it's at the nebulous stage on Python Ideas or drafting up that PEP or on Python Dev,

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:47.900
where it's very much more finalized, like very honing into the technical details of how this would work and really thinking through the ramifications.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.940
And really focus, focus discussion before our final decision is made.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.140
But as I said, this is how it was.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.480
I don't know how we're going to tweak it.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.540
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.900
Yeah, and it should more or less be the same going forward.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:07.400
It just might, we might start being a bit stricter about when PEPs move from Python Ideas to Python Dev to try to make sure the discussion doesn't get rehashed.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.740
And as Carol pointed out, this has kind of brought forward some code of conduct issues that will probably,

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:22.940
I know I'm personally working towards refining and have been since PyCon to help try to push even harder to keep the discussion civil.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.300
Right.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:29.580
And I think in addition to just the civility of the discussions, one of the things that I want to look at is,

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:41.240
can we use some of the great stuff that we have in natural language processing and pull out like the most meaningful content when it comes to comments?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:51.560
And, you know, part of the issue with 572, there were so many comments that you have to kind of read them all if you wanted like the full spectrum.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.180
And not all of us have time to do that.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:30:01.840
And so, you know, a way to condense or shorten the period of comments or something.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:08.540
And that's as much a social issue and in some ways a conduct issue as it is a technical issue.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:13.120
Yeah, that'd be something like in my own community, for instance, in like physical communities,

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:19.600
everybody is welcome to attend the open city council meetings, but hardly anybody does.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.680
However, when there's a change that affects everybody, that's usually posted somewhere.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:29.180
And then there's like a period of open for community comment or something.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:41.880
I'm not saying we need to do that with Python, but I agree with this somewhat, maybe a curated or refereed or some Cliff Notes version of the discussion up till now before somebody can jump in.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.660
Yeah, and that's definitely something that's been talked about.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:50.260
All that puts work on the Python community itself also to do that.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.400
That's work as well.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:31:06.660
Yeah, and actually, historically, the PEP was supposed to capture all of these details, like the rejected idea and open discussion section, open idea section of every PEP was meant to act as a running summary of the discussion to help prevent that.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:14.520
But for instance, in the case of PEP 572, it was a bit overwhelming on the volume, and it can be hard to do that.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:26.340
So as Carol mentioned, there's discussion going on now about how we can potentially help alleviate that load on the PEP author whilst making sure that that kind of thing is taken care of.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.860
Yeah, it sounds like there's some community stuff to do as well.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:35.780
But I have faith that you guys will figure something out in terms of the voting and the decision making.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:42.220
And I guess I want to sort of echo Carol's thought when I ask about the momentum.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:51.160
So much of Python's momentum is with the ecosystem and the extra libraries and PyPI and all of these things.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:58.140
And honestly, if the language didn't change one bit for five years, I still think there would be massive momentum in the community.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.060
So I don't see a real danger here.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:00.840
Not at all.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.720
And honestly, I think the momentum is due to the community.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.400
And Guido has helped shepherd it forward and bring it to where it is.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:17.580
But I think at this point, the language and the community built around it is honestly bigger than Guido at this point.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:27.460
So while we'll all miss Guido immensely and his contribution was very important, I don't think the community should worry because the community itself is going to be what carries this forward.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:37.820
Yeah. And I think a lot of the core developers, as well as community members, are going to ask themselves, hopefully before they post messages and things like, what would Guido have said?

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.360
What would Guido think?

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:47.300
You know, put yourself, write your email messages like you're the BDFL and have to convince people.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:54.360
I think there are some people that are very articulate and have great ideas and add a lot to improving it.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.700
You know, I think the PEP didn't get improved from beginning to end.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:03.460
But it's taxing when you have to slog through the negativity.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:18.840
And I think what Brett is saying, like, hey, let's up our game so that the people who are doing the bulk of the work aren't getting negativity thrown at them when there should be collaboration.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.820
And, hey, this is for the greater good of the language.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.420
It's you don't have to use it or trust.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.500
I think trust is a big part of it.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:34.780
Trust that the people who are making the decisions are being good stewards for the language.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:42.780
And I think the discussion that I've seen so far, I think most people are doing that and will continue to do that.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.760
Yeah, I think that was already mostly there.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.540
It's just it is sad that this put the final straw on to Guido.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.300
But thanks to him for everything that he has done.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.420
I think this may be a good place to leave it.

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:58.440
Brett, Carol, you guys want to have some final parting thoughts on this whole idea?

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.120
Anything else you want to add before we call it a show?

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:01.740
Not really.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.920
I think we've pretty much, as we said, no need to panic.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.720
Keep on coding.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.820
I think we're going to move past this with no real issue.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.280
Obviously, thanks to Guido, as we've all said.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:24.100
And hopefully, while it's sad that Guido is retiring, hopefully we can learn some lessons from why it came about when it did and be better for it coming out the other end.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:24.780
Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:25.080
Carol?

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.400
I agree with what Brett said.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.380
And I also think the surprise may still come.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.080
Guido is not going away.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:43.900
He may be more focusing on things that rock his world that he sort of put on hold while he shepherded the design and decision making of the language.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:48.880
And I think there's still some Guido surprises yet to come.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.760
And I look forward to that.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:57.220
And I just thank him for being an amazing person as well as a great language developer.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.960
Yeah, I totally agree with that.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.000
He actually has not disappeared.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.660
He actually just replied to some emails yesterday and today about PEP 44, which is type hints.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.220
So he's still actively engaged.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.580
So he definitely has not disappeared off the map.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:09.920
Yeah.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:10.360
Nice.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.040
Well, if I could throw some ideas out there.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.380
Python WebAssembly browser.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.500
I'm just going to leave that there if he wants to, you know, try something new.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.600
Brian, anything else?

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:31.880
Yeah, I just want to just the obvious heads up of if you've got a negative reaction about something or some feeling of entitlement, you sleep on it.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.500
You know, don't hit the keyboard right away.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.280
Try to talk to people online as if you were talking to them in person.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:46.540
And again, if you haven't watched the Brett's talk from 2018, Picon, go watch it because it was an eye opener for me.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.500
How similar was that to your PyCascades one, Brett?

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.280
Pretty much the same.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:56.180
It was my PyCascades talk became my PyCon US keynote talk.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:56.420
Yeah.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.640
So definitely people should watch that.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.240
I think it sets the right tone for things.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.260
I'll put that in the show notes.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:03.640
Awesome.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.100
All right.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.500
Thank you all for being here.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:12.860
It's really, I think it's important to spend some time talking about this and just sort of getting that inside information out for everyone in the community.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.040
And I think we're going to be fine.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.680
So let's carry on, huh?

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:16.860
That sounds good.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.240
All right.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:17.680
Bye, everyone.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.000
Bye.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.520
Bye.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:23.000
This has been another episode of Talk Python To Me.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.320
Our guests this week have been Carol Willing, Brett Cannon, and Brian Okken.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.560

That's L-I-N-O-D-E.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.220
Rollbar takes the pain out of errors.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:50.920
They give you the context and insight you need to quickly locate and fix errors that might have gone unnoticed until your users complain, of course.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:57.980
As Talk Python To Me listeners, track a ridiculous number of errors for free at rollbar.com slash talkpythontome.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.220
Now get out there and write some Python code.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:54.880
I really appreciate it.
