00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.680
Python is undergoing a performance renaissance.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.880
We already have Python 3.11 20-40% faster than even Python 3.10.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.120
On this episode, we'll dive into a new proposal to make Python even more efficient using lazy

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.720
imports laid out in PEP 690.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.680
We have all three folks involved on the episode, Carl Meyer, Hermann Bravo, and Barry Warsaw.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.460
Are you ready to get into making Python faster still?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.480
Let's dive in.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:42.020

Hello, Barry, Erman, Carl.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.460
Welcome to the show.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.240
Hey, hello.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.720
It's wonderful to have you all here.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.120
I'm very excited about the work that you're all doing around Python performance.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.180
We're going to focus on imports and this PEP that you three proposed today, but it's really

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.900
just the tip of the iceberg in terms of a bunch of cool stuff that's going on.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.580
So I'm very excited to dive into that with the three of you.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.600
Now, before we get to it, though, let's just do a quick round of introductions.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.240
Barry, you've been on the show before talking about 1994 Python stuff and other things.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.900
So maybe just a quick introduction for yourself.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.320
Yeah.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.980
Barry Warsaw.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.220
So I'm still here hanging around, I guess.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.540
You know, I should mention, you know, as we get into this PEP, though, I'm really just

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.100
the sponsor.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.580
You know, I got to hand a lot of thanks to Jeff Hermann and Carl for doing all the work

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.920
on it.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.080
You know, most PEPs these days, you know, require a core developer to sponsor.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.580
I'm just super interested in the topic.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.760
I think it's a super clever approach.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.100
And so I think it'll help specific needs that I have at work.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.100
And so I was really eager to sponsor it.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.920
Yeah.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.540
Fantastic.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.840
Yeah.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.440
All right.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.160
Very cool.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.400
Hermann, how about you?

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.300
I'm just working at Mana with Carl and I wrote the initial approach for Licey eports.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.600
And well, here I am.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.060
Right on.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.840
Carl, quick introduction.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.400
I've been around the Python community for a while.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.060
I think the first maybe semi-notable thing that I did was write the first version of PIP

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.940
uninstalled back in 2009.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.160
And that led to being a maintainer of pip and virtualen for a while.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.300
And I worked on the Django core team for a while.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.840
And so, yeah, I've been doing Python things for a long time.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.980
And I've been working at Meta.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.640
Those are a lot of big projects there.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.240
Yeah.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.620
They're projects that I was using.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.620
And so I was interested in working on them.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.160
And same goes for Python itself.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.020
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.400
And sorry, I kind of cut you off there.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.280
You said working at Meta since 2016.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.960
Is that what you said?

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.340
Yeah.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.600
I've been working at Meta since 2016.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.220
Working mostly on how Meta uses Python, how Instagram uses Python.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.520
Yeah.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.520
There have been some really cool looks inside what's going on, especially at Instagram.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.700
there with some of the typing talks that Lucas gave, as well as sort of suspending the garbage

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.580
collector for other various things.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.920
And a lot.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.840
Was that you guys?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.520
I think it was, right?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.840
Yeah.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.680
We had a whole.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.640
A lot of neat stuff.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.140
A whole saga.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.000
We turned off the garbage collector, turned back on the garbage collector.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.700
There's been multiple blog posts along the way explaining why we've done each of those

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.860
silly sounding things.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.080
Sure.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.060
I mean, they seem insane.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.480
Well, a lot of the projects that a lot of the stuff that's coming out of here has to

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.620
do with the Cinder project.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.980
Right.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.300
Yeah.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.760
And maybe, I don't know who's best to give the introduction for Cinder, but Cinder's a really

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.480
cool project about, you know, taking a whole bunch of optimizations and specializations you

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.900
all have done and sharing that back with the community a little bit, right?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.260
Yeah.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.740
So we started Cinder in, I think, 2017 or 2018.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.280
There was actually two projects kind of started simultaneously.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.520
We realized around that time that the trajectory for Instagram's kind of server footprint was

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.640
not really sustainable just in terms of how much server CPU time we were spending running

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.340
Python code.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.460
And so we kicked off two projects.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.080
One was called, it's now called Sky Bison.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.520
It was like a ground up rewritten Python interpreter, you know, using all the modern dynamic language

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.540
VM ideas, like a moving garbage collector and all these different things.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.220
We weren't the first people to try that.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.660
And we also weren't the first people to fail.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.760
And that project was wound down last year, just weren't able to get the performance, particularly

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.560
trying to emulate compatibility with the C API and all the C extensions, which is the same

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.320
reason many prior rewrite efforts didn't go very far.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.060
So at the same time as we kicked off Sky Bison, we had sort of kicked off what we thought was

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.880
a short-term project of just like, what can we squeeze out of CPython?

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.860
Where can we get a little more performance out of it?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.280
And that turned into Cinder and then ended up kind of becoming our primary approach to

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.160
Python performance.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.360
Isn't it always the story that the C interop stuff is the big sticking point here?

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.420
I mean, Barry, you must have seen a whole bunch of examples from a core-to-of perspective on

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.840
that, right?

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.160
If we could just change the gill, but the C API defense, but if we could just, but, you

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.320
know.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.620
Yeah.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.780
Yeah.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.020
Yeah.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.100
Yeah.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.380
Yeah.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.380
I mean, it's both, you know, Python's, you know, advantage, you know, pros and cons,

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.660
right?

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:02.220
Like the approachability and the usability of the C API has led directly to the incredible

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.700
ecosystem of extension modules.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.060
Right.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.860
But those also are also the hindrance for moving, you know, ahead in a revolutionary way

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.780
with the interpreter, I think.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.120
Right.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.440
You kind of got to live within the box with the walls that are put up by those constraints.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.300
But I do think it's super important.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.840
You know, a lot of people would maybe just think, well, let's just get rid of it.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.360
Like, let's just try to move beyond it.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.420
But when you hear people say that Python is slow or it has these other problems, so often

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.120
what you'll see is, well, and what I did was I did a for loop in Python and did some math

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.400
and that was slow.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.900
It's like, well, but if a thing is slow, so often that gets rewritten in C and then all

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.800
of a sudden it's faster than, I don't know, what Java or whatever else it is they're trying,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.880
you know, node, but they're trying to compare it to.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.420
And so there's this kind of crazy switch that gets flipped for like really high performance

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.540
and then, you know, maybe acceptable most of the time performance.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.040
And it's this interop with C that is the thing that's the escape hatch.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.300
At LinkedIn, we don't, you know, we don't have the same kind of workloads that they have at

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.340
Meta, but, you know, we've done analysis.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.760
One of the reasons why I was particularly interested in this project is because we write a lot of

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.080
our CLIs in Python.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.820
And so, you know, we've had proponents of other languages say, you know, complain, hey, Python's

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.280
really slow.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.140
So I write a CLI in Python and then it takes a long time to start up.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:28.040
But if you actually do the analysis, what you find is that people are not writing a lot of

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.920
the internal libraries that those CLIs import do things like they go hit the network and they

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.860
go try to do the service and create really expensive resources at module scope time.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.100
Right.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.560
So like those are the types of analysis that you really need to do to say, is it really Python

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.320
or is it the way we use Python?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.680
You know, for us, it's a little of both for sure, but often it's sort of the way Python is being used

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.040
in a non-idiomatic or not in the highest performance way.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.580
Right.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.140
It's a little bit of rewrite of some internal code can get you a long way.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:57.900
It sure can.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.620
Also, I want to just give a quick shout out back on episode 347.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.400
I talked with Dino VLAN like all about the Cinder project.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.980
So if you want to check that out, they can definitely go find that.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.920
But there's a lot of cool things that were taken out of Cinder and are being proposed.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.500
And I guess that sort of brings us to our main topic for today is imports and this PEP 690

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.600
that you all have proposed, which I am also excited for.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.120
I think imports are one of those things that are a little bit mysterious to people because

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.880
they have conceptions coming from other languages, especially compiled languages that are very

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.640
different than what the reality is.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.620
So I do want to talk a whole bunch about what you're offering here, what you're proposing

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.680
here in this lazy imports PEP.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:49.560
But before we do, let's maybe just set the stage with what happens when I write import requests

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.120
or I write import FastAPI or even something built in like import collections.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.100
Who wants to take this one?

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.960
Tell people what really happens when the import statement runs or is there.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.860
There was a time where the import system for Python was written in C.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.540
And it was even more mysterious, I think, at that point.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:13.840
And I don't remember when it was, but Brett Cannon rewrote the import system into Python.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.400
And then about that time, I sort of went through sort of line by line and tried to understand.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.640
I mean, because right, like imports are probably one of the oldest features of Python, right?

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.380
They've been around so long and there's so many corner cases, right?

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.600
It's a very complex system and has lots of features, lots of hooks, lots of places where

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.940
you can hook in your own behavior and really understanding how all of that fits together.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:45.380
I think I probably took a couple of months to sort of walk through the entire system line

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.180
by line and document.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:51.920
Unfortunately, now, if you go to the language reference guide, I think it goes into all the

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.340
gory detail about how imports work.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.860
Everything from namespace packages to, you know, concrete packages and all the file system

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.060
hooks and meta path hooks and, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.520
Yeah, definitely a lot going on.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.320
I think the key thing, though, that you are hinting at there is this is a runtime type of behavior,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.020
right?

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.900
This is a runtime experience.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.220
Carl, you're shaking your head.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.820
What do you want to add to this?

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.240
What Barry was saying here?

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.300
Well, yeah, I mean, I think what a lot of people don't consciously realize initially

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.800
about imports is that it's just executing some more code, right?

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.700
So it's like, you can almost think of imports in Python as like syntax sugar for a function

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.560
call where the body of the function is the module level code of some module and the return

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.100
value is the module object that you end up getting back from the import.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:45.400
But what it really is, is just causing some more code to be executed where the result is

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.060
a module object that has stuff on it that you can use.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:54.340
So, and one of the consequences of that is that literally anything can happen when you

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.240
import a module.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.160
I mean, like Barry was saying, you know, it could go off and talk to the internet.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.240
I think people have even written stuff that like automatically goes and finds modules on

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.200
the internet and downloads them just in time to import them.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.540
But like, but yeah, that's the key point is that you don't have install.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.720
Let's fix that for you.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:13.460
Yeah.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.080
It could be arbitrarily slow.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.860
It could fail.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.720
It could do anything.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.100
Yeah.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.720
Yeah.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.900
You know, if people have a conception of an import statement being like a using statement

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:30.680
in C# or an include statement in C++, that's not, that's kind of effectively the same intent,

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.200
but the behavior is massively different, right?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.880
In C++, it says, here's some symbols that should also be used for compilation.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.260
In Python, it's literally saying, let's just execute this file top to bottom.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.120
And usually execution means define a function, define a function, define a local variable,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:46.960
define a class.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.880
But it could mean run some random thing, search the file system, all sorts of stuff.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:59.420
And it leads to things like this, the if dunder name equal dunder main, right?

00:11:59.420 --> 00:11:59.760
Yeah.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.700
This is a big confusion that people run into.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.940
Why is this weird thing in Python?

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.700
Why do they recommend it, right?

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.020
And it's just because like when you do an import statement, it just runs top to bottom.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.660
And if you put behavior in there, well, that behavior happens, right?

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.140
So here's your way to sort of skip that.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.580
Just as a sidebar, you all have been involved for a long time.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:26.120
Like, should Python have had a deaf main sort of entry point thing like so many languages have?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.700
I'm not saying it should or shouldn't.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.160
I just want to hear your thoughts on this.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.420
I think this is just one of those, you know, quirky things about the,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.360
not even really even about the language.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.260
It's just a quirky thing about the Python, you know, the way you use Python.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:44.160
And to me, it's like one of those things, you learn it and then you just use it.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.500
But actually, I think I tend to use this much, much less now,

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.180
now that we have things like packages and entry points and things like that.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.680
To me, you know, I almost am defining a main function.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.540
And then in my package metadata, I say, well, there's my entry point.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.660
And the packaging system just does it magically.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.740
So this is kind of a convenience.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:10.340
And I don't think you really actually run into it as often nowadays as you probably did,

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.540
you know, years ago.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:11.860
Sure.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.580
All my apps that are supposed to be run directly like that, they all have a def main somewhere.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.700
And then this just calls the main with this symbol here.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.160
Right.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.380
Right.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:20.640
Yeah.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.460
Herman, what do you think?

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:21.960
Yeah.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.880
I totally agree.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.140
And it's probably not something that we should be using as much right now.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:27.640
Yeah.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:27.880
Sure.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.560
Of course, the really interesting thing here, right?

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.120
Is that it's Dunderne.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.920
Right.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.360
Like that's a deeper concept about Python that you should really understand is that modules

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.260
are objects and they have this attribute called Dunder name.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.260
And that Dunder name, that attribute is set to some string.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:53.660
And when you call a, when you not import a file, but call a file using the Python executable,

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:59.540
that file gets done, you know, this string Dunder main assigned to that attribute.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.140
Right.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:00.480
So.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:00.720
Yeah.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.300
Yeah.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.000
Kind of like understanding a little deeper about how Python works is really important,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.080
I think, to get, to be able to use it effectively.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.580
It is.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.000
And you hinted on being more idiomatic to get better performance.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.400
And I totally agree with you.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.200
All right.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:19.000
So now knowing kind of what it means to do an import, let's talk about your pep.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.940
Who wants to introduce the PEP here?

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.060
Herman, you're number one author here.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.060
So how about you go for it?

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.380
Yeah, sure.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.580
Well, we all started long before the pep.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.980
In 2020 is when I joined Meta.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.920
It was just one month before the pandemic hit.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.580
And so I started working in Instagram code base at the time.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:46.900
But there have been a lot of problems cause a problem is there with the reload speeds in the development server and Instagram.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.000
And also another, a ton of other common like too, as well.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:01.640
So what I did is I worked in Instagram code base for a couple of years, trying to fight and touch the startup performance problems that we were in the country all the time.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:09.460
And when you get into code bases, the size of Instagram is, they had a whole bunch of problems that become apparent.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.000
One of those is...

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.520
Yeah, most people don't work at the scale in terms of lines of code or number of servers or anything like that.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.440
You're definitely pushing the outer envelope there.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.460
Yeah, there are thousands and thousands of modules working here.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:28.060
So one of the problems that start to become a parent is startup speed.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:33.320
The other problem is that refactoring modules becomes really, really hard.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:42.020
So if you try to modify something to get it working better, it suddenly starts getting, you suddenly start getting an import cycles.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.680
And all that means when you just live around imports or try to split modules.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.100
So it gets really tricky and hard.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.220
It's complicated.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:16:00.360
So the start speed, when you run a module that imports other modules, and these modules start to run, then those in turn import more than modules.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.200
And this goes on and on.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.900
So all transitive dependencies are involved.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.900
Right, right.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.820
If you just import one thing, it seems minor.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.500
But then that could import two things.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.380
And those two things could import four things.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.080
And then it just, if you're talking thousands of modules, it can explode.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.140
And PEP8 says, import goes at the top.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.400
First thing, right?

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.460
It's like, just to get started before you can even figure out what your code is going to do.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.660
You wouldn't do all the imports, which is the transitive closure of every import, basically, right?

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.140
Exactly.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.800
So it just ends up loading every single module.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.500
Nobody is going to be used immediately or it's never going to be used at all.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.440
So this was an ever ending battle with the Instagram server.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:51.760
And as soon as I realized that I was doing repetitive work, that was very complex and produced a little, very fragile changes.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.920
And that was really hard to maintain.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.680
And at the end, it didn't really yield the improvements that we needed.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:04.140
So I thought, unless I set sail to write less imports, that's when we started implementing that.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:12.400
Well, the PEP is when we tried to show to the world what we did and the results that we were having.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.520
When we get to the U.S. Python 2020 in Salt Lake City.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.760
I was planning to discuss this at the Language Summit.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.940
But at the end, Carl ended up giving a really good overview there, explaining what it was.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:26.660
I don't know.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.500
Carl, can you add?

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:35.520
Yeah, we were, I think, Herman proposed a talk for the Language Summit at this last PyCon 2022 in Salt Lake City for the Language Summit.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.460
And there just wasn't space in the schedule.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.900
So the Language Summit organizers had to pick some things to leave out.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.860
And so they didn't squeeze in lazy imports.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:51.020
But then at the Language Summit, a couple of different people brought up lazy imports that they had heard that we had done this and wanted to know more about it.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.320
And there was a lightning talks slot at the end of the Language Summit.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:01.320
So in the middle of the afternoon, sitting there at the Language Summit, I just put together about 10 slides on what lazy imports is and how it works.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.740
And I gave a quick lightning talk.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:10.380
And on the way back to my seat from giving the lightning talk, Guido leaned over and said, just write the PEP already.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:15.100
So a little bit of positive encouragement and a nudge.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.020
Yeah, that's encouragement.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.040
So then Herman was at the sprints.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.720
And so the two of us sat down together at the sprints on the first day and said, all right, let's write a PEP.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.480
So we put together PEP 690.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.360
And he said, hey, oh, Barry's walking by.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:25.860
Grab him.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:35.320
Well, yeah, this is something that's been on my radar at LinkedIn for quite a while, like I said, because we have tons of CLIs right from Python.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.280
And I think the thing that, like, this is not the first attempt at lazy imports.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.200
Like, you know, there's been lots of different approaches.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:52.540
But I think what really kind of struck, certainly what struck me, and I suspect what struck Guido was the really clever implementation of this particular approach to it.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.640
I don't know who came up with that, but whoever did it was like really a stroke of genius.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:02.480
Because it really gives you the transparency that I think you need to make this a success.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.820
This is a portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Sentry.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.700
How would you like to remove a little stress from your life?

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:16.680
Do you worry that users may be encountering errors, slowdowns, or crashes with your app right now?

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.720
Would you even know it until they sent you that support email?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:30.140
How much better would it be to have the error or performance details immediately sent to you, including the call stack and values of local variables and the active user recorded in the report?

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.560
With Sentry, this is not only possible, it's simple.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.120
In fact, we use Sentry on all the Talk Python web properties.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:43.660
We've actually fixed a bug triggered by a user and had the upgrade ready to roll out as we got the support email.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.660
That was a great email to write back.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.040
Hey, we already saw your error and have already rolled out the fix.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.460
Imagine their surprise.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.680

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.580
Maybe Carl or Hermann can talk about that a little bit.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.580
Yeah, well, let's first define just like what is the PEP proposing?

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:31.440
So we've described traditionally what it means when you say import thing.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.200
It executes all the Python.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.080
And if there's some inline behaviors, that runs those behaviors.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.760
And that all happens at the top.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.740
Like, how is this different?

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.940
What change is this proposing to the CPython runtime?

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.800
Yeah, I mean, the basic idea is just that when you hit an import statement, they say import foo.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:56.360
Instead of immediately at that point going off and finding the foo module, the source code and executing the entire module top to bottom and doing all that work.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.700
And then, of course, all the transitive imports from that and et cetera, et cetera.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:06.640
That all we do when we hit import foo is we basically remember, all right, we have this name foo.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.640
It refers to a module somewhere.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.440
We're going to put off the work of figuring out what that module is and actually executing it.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:19.680
And we're just going to remember that whenever foo is used, that means we need to go find out what it is and actually execute it.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.760
So then that name foo will just kind of sit there in the global namespace of whichever module imported it.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:31.740
And oftentimes foo won't even be used or referenced anywhere in the module body of the module that imported it.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:38.440
So we can go through the whole way importing that module and foo just continues to sit there as kind of this deferred pending import.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.720
And then later at runtime, maybe somebody calls a function from our module.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:49.460
And within that function, we have like we have a call to foo.bar or something like that, a reference to some attribute of the module.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:59.320
And at that moment, the first time we actually at runtime run into a reference to the name foo, that's the moment when we'll suddenly say, OK, hold everything.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.660
We need to go off, figure out what foo is, import it.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.180
And now we actually have the proper foo module.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.440
And now we can go ahead and figure out what foo.bar is and move on.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.580
So that's kind of the essence of PEP690 is to try to do that.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.540
Defer imports until the moment when they're first referenced, but try to do it transparently.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:25.300
So that is as much as possible, apart from side effects of the import itself, you really can't tell the difference in your code that the import was delayed.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:31.840
Right. The runtime behavior might be a little bit different, ideally faster and using less memory, which would be great.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:38.340
But other than that, your code shouldn't, but maybe italics shouldn't know the difference.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:47.460
Right. If you're doing coding styles and good patterns, basically not creating side effects during imports, you shouldn't be able to tell the difference.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:55.340
Right. And so if you've got, say, a function that uses JSON parsing, but that only periodically gets called and under some pass.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:00.840
Right. Like you could avoid import JSON effectively unless you need that bit of functionality.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.700
And for larger projects that can really cascade. Right.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:10.040
Right. That's the whole idea. So if you think of like a command line program that maybe has like 10 subcommands. Right.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:15.860
And each of those subcommands might do something fairly different and they might have very different dependencies.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:24.700
So on any given time that you run that command line program, if you're only using one subcommand, you don't actually need any of the dependencies of the other nine subcommands.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:31.380
So with lazy imports, you can avoid, you can basically pay for what you use every time you run a program and only pay for what you use.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:40.920
Yeah. I really like the idea. And the transparent aspect of it is, and what Barry was fond of, is that we write code the way we traditionally wrote.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:51.840
We write import requests or import JSON or whatever at the top. And it's up to a special dictionary that replaces a standard dictionary that holds the globals.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.980
It says when you access one of these things, if it's not yet materialized and really imported, go do that and then hand it off.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.180
Otherwise, just hand off the module. Right. Something like that.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.900
Yeah. I think you put it really well.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.180
Thanks.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:09.000
It's actually a standard dictionary for the module, but it's just a specialized lookup function, essentially.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.440
Got it.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:24.420
Right. So when that deferred object gets installed into the module's dictionary, and this is, I think it's really key because at the point at which that the dictionary lookup function finds this deferred object, that's when the object is resolved.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:35.700
And what that means is that at the Python level, and even if you're an extension writer accessing the module's dictionary, you never see those deferred objects.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:41.400
So they're completely hidden both from the C extension author and Python developer.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.360
It's just completely bad. And that's where the transparency really shines.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:51.640
That's where, yeah, because if you're going to force a new programming model onto people, all of a sudden they're going to not like it.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:58.180
And we saw how easy that was to go from two to three. Right. So let's not try that again.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:04.760
Oh, it was so easy. I got this before we get further into this. It's worth pointing out that this is in draft status, right?

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:17.660
It was created out a month and a week ago. So it's not super old. It's in draft. If it appears, it'll be in 312, probably. What's the status of the PEP? It's basically proposed and under discussion?

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.800
Yeah. It's currently discussed. Yeah.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:30.400
I think I went and looked recently and saw that in the, in discuss.python.org in the PEPs category. I think the PEP 690 thread has more posts than any other thread there.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.740
So it's been.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:32.300
Okay. That's exciting.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:42.180
It's been thoroughly discussed. But at this point, I think to some extent, the discussion is on hold while we work on getting an implementation against the Python main branch.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:56.680
Cause our implementation in Cinder, Cinder is unfortunately still based on Python 3.8. We're currently working on upgrading it to 3.10, but there's some changes in the underlying dictionary and other things between 3.8 and now 3.12 alpha.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:05.080
So the implementation needs some, some reworking and we need to get that available for people to look at and play with to really move to the next stage in discussion.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:11.460
Yeah. Just a side note. So with projects like Cinder and stuff, it's based on 3.8, which is great. There's a lot of good features.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:21.580
I mean, basically three, six and beyond you get f-strings, you get async and away, you get a lot of amazing stuff there, but the shift from 10 to 11, there's a big performance boost.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:30.920
It's sort of coming along there. Are you guys looking to sort of bring all of this stuff into 11 as sort of a stable point or what's the story there?

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.840
For Cinder in general?

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.160
Yeah.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:32.300
Yeah.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:42.120
Yeah. So I mean, we're currently upgrading to 3.10 just to go two versions at a time instead of kind of leap three versions in one bound.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:52.080
And also because as you said, there's a lot of changes between 3.10 and 3.11. So we want to kind of isolate those and get 3.10 stable first and get it in production for Instagram and everything.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:57.520
So that's our current target. And then once that's done, we'll probably look at 3.12 next.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:57.940
Sure.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:07.060
We do want to bring Cinder up to date. And also we're really looking at trying to upstream a lot of the things that are in Cinder so that more people can benefit from them.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:12.180
And to reduce the amount of work we have to do to be constantly rebasing all of our stuff on newer versions of Python.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.840
So our goal, hopefully, is that lazy imports.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:20.960
Sure. Everything that you get accepted is just one fewer thing you have to maintain. You can kick it to Barry. Let Barry do it.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.720
That's right.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:26.380
Well, I mean, we hope to continue to help maintain these things upstream too.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:33.900
Yes, of course. Yeah, of course. But if you can make it part of the broader community thing, it's no longer your team. It's the community's benefit.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:39.080
Okay. Let's talk a little bit about some of the different forms of imports and how they affect this.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:46.320
Because out in the audience, Hybrid Robotics asks, when you do from library import function, does this really save memory?

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:52.200
I think that maybe sets the stage for talking about when there's different styles of imports we can do.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:59.280
Obviously, we can just do import library. We can do from library import function or import star, all these different things.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.020
And there's rules in the PEP about how that controls the laziness or the alternative.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.040
I guess the current default way is called eager loading or eager imports, right?

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:18.160
I think it's really good that Hybrid Robotics brought up this question of from library import function, because that's actually a key way that PEP 690 is different from the existing ways of doing lazy imports.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.300
So there are existing things out there. There's a lazy import loader in the standard library.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:27.480
And there's something called demand import on the package index that came out of Mercurial.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.560
And all of these things take the approach of having a custom module object.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.040
Right.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:41.920
That when you do a get attribute on it, it has a dunder get adder or dunder get attribute implementation that waits for an attribute access and then goes out and does the import.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:53.540
And that works for import foo, but it doesn't make from foo import bar lazy because from foo import bar gets the foo module and then you immediately access the bar attribute on it.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:29:01.820
And so if you're using this lazy module object style, then effectively it's just eager because you get the attribute off it right away and that makes the import happen.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:13.140
And the difference with PEP 690 is that with from foo import bar, we just stick a lazy object into the namespace of the importing module under the name bar instead of under the name foo.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:20.640
But it's still a lazy object and the import still won't happen until something later actually uses the name bar.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:30.380
So even in the case of from foo import bar, we're still able to make it lazy and it still will save memory at least until or unless you actually use the imported thing.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.600
Yeah, that's a great summary.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:36.180
I would like to point out maybe just not entirely sure where they're coming from here.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:44.020
So today, if you write from library import function versus just import library or from library import star, you're not really saving any memory.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.580
It basically is doing the same thing, right?

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.880
The module object is created.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.840
It's imported.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.780
All the stuff is done.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.100
It's just what symbols are defined for you, right?

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.460
It's more of a syntax thing than it is a memory thing right now.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.880
Yeah, that's correct.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.160
Yeah.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:01.780
But in the thing you're proposing, this will still be the lazy version, which is great.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.140
Yes.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.960
Yeah.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.320
So there's different ways in which we do import.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.000
Sometimes people even do imports inside of try blocks.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.860
So like try to import this thing.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:18.580
And if it's not there, maybe try to shim it in or report that this module is a dependency or other things.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:25.320
And it's literally the import statement that is supposed to succeed or fail that communicates back whether or not that was okay.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:25.640
Right.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.460
And with this lazy version, you're going to change.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:35.080
It's not going to fail within that try block because within the try block, it's going to create a deferred lazy thing.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.340
And that'll always work, right?

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.640
It actually could also fail in certain circumstances.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.480
But for the most part, it should just work.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:49.640
If you have an import inside a try block or inside a class or inside a function, all those imports are eager imports.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:49.940
Right.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.240
Exactly.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:31:00.040
So what I was getting at is that you were actually specifying that if there's an import within a try except or within a width block, you're actually not letting that be lazy.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.600
You're making them be eager, right?

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.040
That's right.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:02.700
Yeah, exactly.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.240
Although imports inside this important thing are also lazy.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:16.340
So if any of those fail and you are expecting those to fail, it could not throw an exception there in that reason, in that case.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:16.660
Okay.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:21.380
And then also from thing import star has to be eager.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.480
Why does that one have to be eager?

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.920
Yeah, because we don't have the clean names that are being imported.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:32.700
So there's no way to add these lazy objects to these names.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:37.120
So we need to just import everything and see what are the names that are being imported.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.760
That's the main reason for it.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.020
Yeah.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:39.540
Right.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:44.820
Because when you say star, you don't know what to put into the module's symbol table, right?

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:49.220
So you've got to actually do the import to figure out the star.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.460
That's pretty interesting.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:50.780
All right.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.680
So there's some interesting examples you have in the PEP that people can check out about.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:32:03.200
Here's sort of a fake slow module that just does time.sleep, but it effectively shows that it could be slow.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:12.920
And you can run it like do an import and it'll run instantly basically because it's not actually, if you're not accessing that module really at that point, it's pretty much instant.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:19.780
I guess one thing to point out here, and this is, I don't know how I feel about this, but maybe we could talk about it a bit.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:32.960
The proposal is that this is not the default behavior for Python indefinitely into the future, that you have to pass a dash L flag to the interpreter or set an environment variable or something along those lines.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.640
You want to talk about why make it opt in instead of maybe opt out?

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.740
I wish it was a default.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.440
That's what I wish to.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:49.120
But the thing, the reality is that there are a lot of applications and modules that are using or relying on import side effects.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:55.240
So we can just expect those to be lazy or compatible anytime soon.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.880
So you're saying there's a lot of bad code out there.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.480
Is that what you're saying?

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.060
No.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:58.820
No, I'm just teasing.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:05.200
But if it has side effects, right, if it's like, oh, because you imported this, we've initialized the database connection.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.640
There's actually some really good discussion on the discourse thread.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:23.620
I feel like this is actually an important aspect of the PEP because one of the things that was sort of pointed out in this discussion is that I both author libraries and I author applications, right?

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:45.460
As a library author, I can't really reason about whether I can sort of say, yeah, maybe my library is unsafe for lazy, but I can never really say, you know, assert that my module is safe for laziness and be certain that in all the way that all my downstream consumers are going to use my library, right?

00:33:45.500 --> 00:34:15.480
That it's always going to be safe for lazy imports.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:24.640
So by using it, I'm a little uncertain about the environment variable, but I feel pretty strongly like the flag, the dash, capital flag.

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:24.940
Yeah.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.580
It's the responsibility of the person running it, sort of.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.480
It's the leap.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:28.820
Yeah.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.320
It's the top of the tree.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.220
Yeah.

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:33.480
Yeah.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:41.620
To give an example of what Barry's talking about is like, I mean, for better or worse, some level of import side effects are just kind of built into Python.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:55.900
Like if you have a module that subclasses a class from another module, you may think that you have a module with no import side effects, but actually importing your module adds something to the Dunder subclasses of the module you inherited from.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:04.940
And so even code that apparently looks very clean and clear of import side effects does technically have some side effects on import.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:09.880
And the real question is, is anybody actually looking at Dunder subclasses on the parent module?

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:20.100
And, you know, there's a lot of common library patterns like decorators that when you decorate a function, they register that function to that class and some registry and some other module.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.440
So then suddenly again, you have an import side effect.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:22.920
Like Flask or something.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.260
Yeah.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:23.680
Right.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:23.920
Yep.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.320
Exactly.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:29.840
So you really have to, it really has to be the person writing the application and testing the application.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.160
You says, I'm going to try lazy imports.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.300
I'm going to see if things work.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.920
I know how my dependencies are used.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.600
If it works well and all my tests pass, then I can consider just turning this on at that level.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:40.940
Sure.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:41.680
Okay.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.180
Interesting.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:48.020
Taking Barry's idea that it's the application owner who should sort of make this decision.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:53.520
What about having some code artifact that allows you to signal that as well?

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:53.920
Right.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.080
So as I run it, I can control whether or not this happens.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:05.420
But what if I just the very first line of my app.py or whatever it is, I just say import lazy or something like that.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.940
And then every subsequent thing from there on behaves that way.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:15.020
That way, if I distribute my app to someone else, I don't have to convince them or teach them about dash L.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:18.520
I can just say, no, just double click this thing or run this.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.260
And it'll just, it'll go in a consistent way.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:27.280
As long as you don't have like PTH files that are getting in the way, you know, before your main gets called.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.580
Go ahead, Carl.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:29.920
Sorry.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.120
Yeah, no, I was just going to say there was a lot of discussion about that in the thread.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.700
And there actually is a draft of a heavily revised version of the PEP.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.220
For Barry's review, actually.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.200
So Barry, you can.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.920
Barry, let me throw that up for you.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.380
We can go through it.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:43.540
Yeah.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:37:00.420
One of the changes that is made in that draft is both removing the environment variable because people were concerned about the risk that if somebody just got the idea that, oh, lazy imports makes everything faster, they might try to just set the environment variable in their shell.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:05.580
And then all of the Python programs they run will try to run with lazy imports and might break.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.620
And then they're reporting bugs.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.240
And that's not a great experience.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.680
So we want it to be really limited to an application that's tested with lazy imports.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:21.900
So the latest draft of the PEP removes the environment variable and actually adds exactly what you're talking about, a programmatic way to enable lazy imports for your application in code.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.400
What is the code way?

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.780
Well, I mean, it's just a proposal in my draft PR to the PEP text right now.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.160
So we'll see what Barry says about it.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:29.400
Sure.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.340
It could well change.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.240
I just rubber stamped it.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:44.340
So the reason I ask is there's sometimes certain things you've got to do to, like, tweak the path or something to get imports to work right if you're running from some weird location or something.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.880
Think of, like, alembic migrations and stuff like that.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:58.200
But in a lot of the editors and the linter's, they'll whine at you and say, no, no, no, these imports that go below that modification to the path statement, they go above it.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.820
Like, no, the whole point of the thing above it is so the things below it don't fail.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:02.460
Right.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:06.600
Is there, like, whatever it is, I just want to put in a little hint.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:14.200
Like, if you could make the editors not complain that the stuff below it should go above it because the stuff below it is controlled by the stuff above it.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:14.720
You know what I mean?

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:21.600
Yeah, the current proposal, I don't think, I mean, I suppose if it becomes merged, the linters and such could special case it.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:29.880
I think hopefully that's not too huge of an issue because the idea is, I mean, you potentially have a large application and this would occur, like, in one main module, right?

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.800
You would just put like that.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.520
Call this function.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:31.800
Right.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.800
You put the hash, ignore, and then you're good to go.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.080
Right.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:34.400
Got it.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.440
Okay, cool.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.800
Let's go talk about some benefits here.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:50.360
So, in terms of performance, so it says it's already been demonstrated for startup time improvements of 70% and memory reduction of real-world CLIs by 40%.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.860
Those are not joking around.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.260
This is not, like, playing at the edges of performance changes.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.580
This is significant.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:02.260
So, are those numbers from what you're doing with Instagram or other tools that you tested it on or something like that?

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:09.440
These are numbers from Instagram, Instagram server, and also I love command line tools that we use inside Meta.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.840
So, yeah, these are real numbers.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.020
It's about 70%.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.840
Sometimes we've seen 50% improvement in startup speed.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.960
Memory is also up to 40%.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.840
We've seen 20%.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.680
Right.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.800
These are upper bounds, of course.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.040
Sure.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:29.960
But what I think is good about that is it's not, you know, sometimes people say, well, let's see how fast Python is.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:39.280
I'm going to do a wild true loop and see how many times I can increment a number and compare that to doing that and see, like, okay, nobody does this and they don't really care about how fast.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.980
Like, how do real apps behave?

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.400
How do real?

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:48.360
And so, this is you taking the stuff that you all work with day to day and trying to make it faster and getting significant benefits from it.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.160
Not weird little edge case benchmarks.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.880
Yeah, I think an important thing to note there that Hermann mentioned is that this isn't just one code base.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:00.900
So, you know, we've seen this as repeatable scale of improvement across a variety of different tools.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:08.240
In fact, recently, we've started to see we have a lot of data science people and researchers who use a lot of Jupyter notebooks.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:20.240
And they've started to really quickly pick up Jupyter notebooks kernels based on Cinder with lazy imports enabled because they're seeing similar startup time and memory use numbers for their Jupyter notebooks.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:27.720
So, like, across a fairly wide range of use cases and types of programs, we are seeing these kinds of numbers as consistently repeatable.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.620
Yeah, that's interesting to the data science side.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.180
A lot of those libraries are pretty large.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:34.580
And so, I suspect that that's probably pretty valuable.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:42.940
So, one of the things you all talk about is that this proposal also will eliminate, what would you call it, like, false import cycles?

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:43.480
I don't know.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.340
Do you want to talk about this cycle benefit that we might get here?

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:47.600
Yeah.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.320
Throw it out to all of you.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.160
Whoever wants to grab it.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:49.500
I didn't.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.980
Can try to say something about the import cycles.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:41:02.780
When you have imports at the top of the module, and you're not using these imports, and some of the imports that you are declaring there are importing something on the end to us.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.040
At some point, it's importing the first module.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.880
Then you have a cycle, right?

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:18.960
So, if one of these imports is not actually being used, and it's being deferred to a use case where it's only resolved inside a function,

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.180
further down, which is not being immediately called, then we won't have these cycles.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:32.140
And then a lot of times when we have this kind of imports that are declared on the top of the modules, because

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:37.500
But it hates this that is recommended to have all imports in the top of the module.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:43.600
And so people just start putting imports there because it's cleaner and looks better, but

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:48.880
it needs to stop provoking these, causing these import cycles.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.260
Nice.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.880
So hopefully this will solve some of those issues.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.780
I know when I first got into Python, I didn't understand why there wasn't a better way out

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:01.580
of like sharing code in a bi-directional way.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.440
It was really, it took a lot of thinking like, okay, how can I structure my code into different

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:12.340
files that don't feel like it's all just went in one file and yet allow me to reference it?

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.040
Like, for example, if I've got one class and it works with another and it has a function

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.640
that returns one type of it, but the other one might have a field, which is one of those.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.700
And you want to do a type declaration of saying which one is which, or you need to create the

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.880
call initializer of one or something.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.400
Those kinds of bi-directional relationships are hard to model.

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.780
And it sounds like this doesn't really address or fix or change those in any significant

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.060
way.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.520
But the other ones just about the timing can go away, right?

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:44.860
The only import cycles that lazy imports don't fix are the ones where basically it would be

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:50.460
a cycle, even if you had it in the same module, like where you're literally using names in a

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.900
bi-directional way at module level.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.020
And so there's no way you could order them even within one module and have it work.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.960
And so essentially forward references, those kinds of cycles, the lazy imports doesn't fix.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:06.740
But really any other kind of cycle or anywhere in the cycle, one of the uses is inside a function.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.960
All of those are taken care of.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:15.040
And so even for the type annotation ones, if you use from future import annotations, PEP 563,

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:21.820
or another proposal, PEP 649, anything that makes the type annotations also lazily evaluated,

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:26.700
so they aren't eagerly evaluated at import time, then all of a sudden your cycles went with that

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.740
plus lazy imports.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.140
Then all the cycle problems with type annotations also just disappear.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.700
I was just going to say, I think one of the interesting things that I think it was Carl

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.840
pointed out when we were talking about this is that if you've got the converse is right,

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:43.240
if you've got an application or something that's using these lazy imports, and then you turn

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:50.220
them off, you might be hit with a bunch of cycles that were sort of, you know, hidden from

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.940
you because of the lazy feature, right?

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:57.520
So you have to be a little bit careful about engaging with lazy imports and then turning them

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:57.860
off.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:58.160
Right.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.140
Getting everything eager.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.180
So it's just one of those things to watch out for.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:01.860
Oh, interesting.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:02.180
Yeah.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:07.720
If you're doing it by running it with the run flag, you could be effectively hiding a runtime

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.160
error that someone else would hit if they ran it without.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:10.460
Yeah.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:10.780
Right.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:14.540
Kind of back to my like, could the code define this instead of a runtime flag?

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.440
So it's like absolutely consistent.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:16.720
Yeah.

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.120
Let's talk about debuggability a little bit.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:24.340
So normally when you have an exception, if I import thing and there's a problem importing that

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.840
thing, I'll get an exception on the line that the import did.

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:33.840
But with this lazy thing, it'll be the import error will occur where the first attempt to

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.300
touch it happens.

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:36.060
Right.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.620
But you all do some work to figure out and sort of report back.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.840
the error came from where the original import statement was, right?

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.200
Yes.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:47.940
The error should be reported where the import is being declared so that it's easier to do

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:51.540
But this can also produce import error and send anywhere.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:45:02.600
So the other thing that we are thinking about adding to this implementation is to have an error wrapper around the real error that is being thrown.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:07.840
So we can easily know that it's just an import error coming from a lazy import.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:08.880
Yeah.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:14.660
It could theoretically, I guess, get caught in a situation where people would have not expected it.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:14.900
Right.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:18.620
It could have a overly aggressive try accept block.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.440
There's like, well, there's only two types of exceptions that come out of here possibly ever.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.340
And either of them, I'm going to handle it in this case.

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.300
Well, now here's a third.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.040
Surprise.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:27.960
Yeah.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.280
Okay.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:33.540
But at least from sort of figuring out where the error came from, I guess you guys, what do you call it?

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.420
Deferred exceptions is what you actually called that, right?

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:36.760
Right.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.780
So there's a couple of code examples in here.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.500
And I'm going to kind of flip through here and check it out.

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:43.980
You also have some code APIs.

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:48.740
I talked about my wish for some code thing to declare laziness, I guess, is the way to put it.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.280
But different things happen.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.000
Like if you do the import within a try block, that forces them to be eager.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:59.380
But you also have defined this eager imports context manager, sort of.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.500
That will force the imports to be eager, right?

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.920
And I say sort of because it's not actually the eager imports thing.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.860
It's the width block.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:10.120
Whatever you put in there, if you do an import in it, is what's going to trigger it, right?

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:10.420
Yeah.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:11.040
It doesn't matter.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:11.400
Yeah.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:19.180
And then the third way is you can import set eager imports and actually pass like namespace names in there.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:25.820
Because one of the problems is I'm going to import a thing that's a package whose code I don't control.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.700
And I need it to, for one particular thing, eagerly import that, right?

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.560
So you kind of have to force it down the line where it's out of the chain of control there.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:40.640
So you can sort of set like, I want to do FastAPI dot whatever, like exceptions or whatever's in there.

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:45.200
I want to make sure that that eager loads, even though I don't control FastAPI, right?

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.320
So you want to talk about some of these code tricks that you have here?

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:48.740
Yeah.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.200
Or tools, I guess is a better word.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:50.600
Yeah.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.280
Let's say the eager imports is just for opting out certain modules.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:47:04.260
Application owners should be the ones adding the incompatible libraries here if they find or figure out that they aren't playing well with lazy imports.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:04.680
Yeah.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:17.260
So if I write a library and I see that my sub module cannot deal with being lazy, I could put this in my code to avoid, no matter what people set for the runtime flag, I could avoid that problem for my library, right?

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.240
Yeah, exactly.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:28.580
So you can always try first and if you're the application owner and you know exactly what you need to do this application for, to work, you can try it in modules.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.860
And a lot of the libraries just work out of the box.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.560
So you don't need to do anything.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.740
There are some, some libraries that don't work.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:42.200
And if you can make those work in some other way, you can then add these as eager imports.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:46.240
What's the, I don't know if it's a lazy imports in those libraries.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:46.560
Yeah.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.280
Yeah.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.080
These are really interesting to see here.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:55.300
Like you can even pass a callback that will be handed a module name and it can, it can decide.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:48:01.620
You could say, I don't want to just say all the names that are of the sub module, but just anything that matches this pattern.

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.380
Let's just tell it.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.080
We want to eagerly import that.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:05.340
Yeah.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:05.600
Yeah.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:05.900
Yeah.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.120
Yeah.

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:06.900
It looks nice.

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:07.380
I like it.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:15.140
There's a, another question from audience back to a code question and explicit opt-in is a hybrid robotics.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:15.560
Also asked.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:21.480
I really liked the idea of import lazy or lazy import library or something like that to be explicit about it.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:29.920
And you all actually specifically addressed whether or not there should be some syntax code that makes this happen instead of changing the default one.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.100
Right.

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.260
What's the thoughts there?

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:37.700
I think generally we're not opposed to the idea of syntax for lazy imports.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:49.280
The kinds of like memory and startup time wins that we've seen really depend on very broad application of lazy imports with just very narrowly targeted opt-outs.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:59.560
That's what you need in order to really get to a situation where you're actually paying for what you use in a robust way where you're not in a situation where you just accidentally add one import in one place.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.860
And all of a sudden all your gains just disappear like that.

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:08.260
If it's really across the code base, then it's very robust startup time and memory wins where you add one import.

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:13.200
And while you might pay for a little more, but you're not going to suddenly start paying 100% of the cost again.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:22.480
It feels like adding new syntax is a much bigger hurdle in terms of the steering council and having to change the Python grammar and all of that.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:36.000
And when the syntax, the per import syntax isn't really even useful in gaining the wins that are the primary motivation for the PEP, then it doesn't feel like a good trade-off to add that to the PEP.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:36.240
Sure.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:36.580
Yeah.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.580
I think I agree with that.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:38.780
That seems pretty reasonable to me.

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:39.760
What about the reverse?

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:48.480
What about if you, instead of doing something like this, where you say, I'm going to force these to be, I'm going to run some code to make these modules eager.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:55.200
What if as a library author, I could write eager import my thing or something along those lines.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.760
Now, I really don't want to see more syntax in Python.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.860
There was a huge battle over whether a colon goes by an equal sign.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.880
So I'm not necessarily suggesting that we should do this.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:07.340
I would say there's nothing necessarily wrong with that.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:11.760
It's more just that adding new syntax is a higher bar and maybe we should get some experience.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:21.500
When the same thing is easily possible with existing syntax, like a context manager, we may as well get some experience with the future in a less invasive way before we go adding syntax.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:21.800
Right.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:26.120
If you see so many people using it and benefiting from it, then you could consider it.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:34.280
I mean, one example of that is like 3.4 to 3.5 when there was asyncio introduced and then there was async and await introduced on top of that.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:34.560
Right.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.480
Even things like property, right?

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:43.740
Like the property decorator was, you know, a feature that was available for the decorator syntax was added.

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.920
So it's a tried and true strategy for Python.

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:53.900
Let's get experience with the feature and then we can make adjustments and syntax to make it prettier, you know, down the road.

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.100
Yeah, that's a good path.

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:56.920
Awesome.

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:57.480
All right.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.640
Well, really, really good work on this, you guys.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.120
This is exciting.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:06.740
I would like to see the status change from draft to something further.

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:11.080
I guess I have to go do something after this chat.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.140
Perhaps so.

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:12.560
Perhaps.

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.260
Awesome.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:21.460
But now people know about the conversation much more broadly and maybe we'll get some more, even more comments on the discourse thread there.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:24.780
Let's maybe wrap that up because I think we're about out of time.

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:29.620
But before I let you all out of here, you've got the two questions to quickly answer since there's three of you.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.580
Barry, if you're going to write some code, what editor are you using these days?

00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:34.880
It's always going to be Emacs for me.

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:35.240
I know.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:38.180
You know, it's funny because Brett works at Microsoft.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.400
And so, you know, LinkedIn and Microsoft, we share.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.760
He has something to do with some editor.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.940
I think people, a few people may have heard of him or something.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:45.280
Yeah.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:53.640
And I keep telling Brett, I want to, I want to, you know, if I was starting today, I would probably, yes, Emacs is just kind of deeply in my bones.

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.740
Got it.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:55.700
German, how about you?

00:51:55.700 --> 00:52:00.920
I used to use Sublime Text, even though it didn't have AutoComplete.

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:10.360
So I added some AutoComplete from porting, Komodo IDE Editor, AutoComplete to Sublime Text.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.960
But now that it's in meta, I'm using VS Code.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.580
And also being when I'm in the terminal.

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:16.080
Right on.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:16.460
Carl?

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.040
Yeah, I used to be an Emacs user.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:22.960
I mentioned that's how Barry and I very first connected back at PyCon 2008.

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.460
But I have switched to VS Code.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:34.780
There's a lot of integrations with VS Code in terms of meta infrastructure and maintaining all that stuff myself for Emacs just became more of a hassle than I wanted to pay.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.520
So I've switched to two jobs.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.220
One was enough.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.540
Right.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.520
All right.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:46.600
And then notable PyPI package, something that you think is pretty cool you just want to give a shout out to, popular or not.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.420
Go in reverse order.

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:48.040
Carl, how about you?

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:55.060
Well, I guess I'll give a shout out to something that I use in all of my projects, which is, I guess, depending on the project, either Pyre or mypy.

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:58.080
I'm a big fan of type checking my Python codes.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:58.860
Yeah, fantastic.

00:52:58.860 --> 00:52:59.420
German?

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:01.620
Yeah, well, Pyre is pretty good.

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:02.500
Oh, I don't know.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:07.740
And microsort, which sorts your imports at the top of the file.

00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:09.020
So it's really useful.

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:16.040
If there's an import syntax that makes all the other ones lazy, all these tools are going to have to learn about, well, this one doesn't go before the other.

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.920
Or you could give it something like A, A, A, A, A, A, A, lazy.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.660
I guess.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.920
All right, Barry, how about you?

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:28.540
Notable package?

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:33.840
For me, it's a PDM, which is a package manager and sort of a build backend.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:45.180
I went through an exercise a couple of months ago where I just was finally wanting to get rid of all my setup.pies and setup.cfgs and just fully embrace pyproject.tomil and see how far it could go.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:52.240
And I was actually pretty happy with being able to get rid of both of those legacy packaging files.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:56.160
So I tried a bunch of the different package managers and I really liked PDM.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.700
So I kind of, you know, settled on that one for my personal stuff.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:00.540
Yeah, fantastic.

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:01.000
All right.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.420
Well, final call to action.

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.340
People want to maybe have their thoughts heard on this.

00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:05.960
What do they do?

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.580
I guess the discourse thread.

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:07.940
Yeah.

00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:08.620
Discussed up.

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:09.380
Python.org.

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:12.000
Look for the PEPS category and look for PEPS 690.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:12.420
Yeah.

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:12.840
Cool.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.460
You can love it or not love it or stuff like that.

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:19.420
There's sort of ways to give just a heart feedback as well.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:20.220
So cool.

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.500
The other thing you can do is pressure the sponsor of the PEPS to stop being so lazy.

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.620
And that's something.

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.720
I would find it incorrect if you were not lazy on this particular one.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:38.000
I mean, you got to just swim in that waterfall and see how it feels before you can really make a decision.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.900
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.220
Awesome.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:41.740
All right.

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.680
Well, gentlemen, thank you for being here.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.160
It's been great having you all on the show.
