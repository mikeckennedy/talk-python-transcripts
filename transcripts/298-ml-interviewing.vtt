00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.060
Are you building or running an internal machine learning team?

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.860
How about looking for a new ML position?

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.840
On this episode, I talk with Chip Heughan from Snorkel AI about building ML teams,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.900
finding ML positions, and teaching machine learning.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.980

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.640
Chip, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.480
Hi, Michael.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.400
Nice to meet you.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.700
Thanks so much for having me.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.340
Nice to meet you, and thanks for coming on the show.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.560
It's going to be a lot of fun to talk about ML and putting ML into production and building

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.320
ML teams.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.260
We're going to talk a lot of, probably cover a lot of buzzwords, right?

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.220
Like, AIS and ML are so top of mind in all of the...

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.320
I need to impress people by throwing out all the buzzwords, yeah.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.680
That's right, right.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.920
IBM had this really funny commercial, which is ironic that it was IBM, but it had this really

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.200
funny commercial, like, 10 years ago called Buzzword Bingo.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.060
I don't know if you ever saw that, but it was really, really hilarious.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.580
We'll see if I can link to it in the show notes, if I can dig it back up on YouTube.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.440
But yeah, so we could definitely win that one today, just because it's such a growing

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.620
and interesting topic.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.100
Yeah.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.940
But before we get to all that, of course, let's start with your story.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.520
How do you get into working with programming in Python and machine learning?

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.940
It's really funny because when I was younger, I thought being a programmer was the most boring

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.800
job in the world.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.620
I was like, why would anyone want to spend the rest of their life sitting in a basement looking

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.500
to come to screen?

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.540
This is for the anti-social people.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.760
They don't want to go outside.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.520
They just, like you said, sit in a basement.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.780
Yeah.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.900
Don't they have friends?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.860
Yeah, I know.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.660
Yes, exactly.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.480
Come on.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.720
Yeah.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.080
The views changed over the last 20 years or so, right?

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.760
Like it's...

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.020
Yeah.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.120
Society has sort of viewed that differently, but yeah, it's how it was.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.800
I think as far as growing up, you just realize you becomes a person that you make fun of,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.080
you know?

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.100
So that's the story of my life.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.480
So when I was younger, I actually come from a writing background.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.580
So I was traveling the world.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.000
I know it sounds like nice and stuff, but it's like not that nice.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.900
So I was traveling the world and writing a lot about culture, people, a lot of food.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.900
So I can't just stand for thinking I would major in script writing because I thought it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.780
would be fun.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.600
But then I took some CS courses and they talked to CS friends and they were like, what?

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.480
Is this what you make for an internship?

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.460
It's like what my family makes like the entire year or something.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.840
So I was like, what is so cool about it?

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.180
So I took CS courses.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.520
Wait a minute.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.000
Maybe I should pay attention to this, right?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.120
This is starting to sound good.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.140
Yes, yes.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.600
So yeah, so I took some CS courses and I think Stanford did a really great job of like getting

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.980
people interested in computer science because also introductory courses are extremely well

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.720
designed and exercises are not just like, I don't know, boring things.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.180
It's like trying to design a button to increase something.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.520
I don't know.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.360
I don't know what boring lectures are, but there's an exercise like building games.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.360
So you could play games.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.980
Yeah.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.700
So a lot of fun things.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.520
So I took them and I took the courses.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.720
I really enjoyed them.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.040
And then I took more courses.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.480
I think initially it was more of like financial needs because I need to TA to get some pocket

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.820
money.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.140
But then I TA'd and then I met some wonderful people who are so TAing.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.240
I think at Stanford was of course, we couldn't session leading.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.660
It was really fun.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.700
And I think I just getting sucked into it.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.260
And fast forward four years, I major in computer science.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.740
Yeah.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.420
That's amazing.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.020
Do you still do any writing?

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.860
Oh, yes.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.480
I still write a lot.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.820
So I think it's kind of tricky because of writing.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.900
And technical writing is very different from the kind of writing I did before.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.760
So I can't really switch among them easily.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.280
So I think for me, it would be like a month just focused on technical writing.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.660
So like blog posts and documentation.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.240
So I write a lot about, for example, like paper summarizations or just some new techniques

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.900
that I learned.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.520
I think recently I did something about.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.940
So I look up like 200 machining tools I could find and I try to analyze.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.460
Oh, no, no.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.140
Wow.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.380
It took me so much time.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.100
So the kind of writing is very different because in people in political writing, they want to

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.940
get to the point, right?

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.920
But also sometimes I still like to write stories like non-fictions.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.080
And when you write stories, people want to take another journey.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.200
They just don't want to show the destination right away.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.520
So I tried and I do a month of that and then I switch my set to another.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.120
So yes, I still write a lot.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.720
That's cool.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.860
It sounds like a lot of fun.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.680
So one of the things that is interesting about your story is like you decided to do some programming

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.980
classes and get into it.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.700
And at first you were not so sure that that was the full on path that you wanted to go

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.020
down.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.540
And as you got deeper into it, you saw it as more interesting.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.900
You made friends and connections and you sort of saw the human side of it and got sucked

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.960
more and more into it, right?

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.680
Yeah.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.660
Like, yeah, programmers do have friends.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.920
Yes.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.640
I learned that.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.260
So yeah, that's good.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.500
Right.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.540
Encouraging.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.060
Yeah.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.180
Well, the thing that's interesting to me is a lot of times you hear people early in

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.780
their career thinking about like, well, what should they study?

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.380
What should they go into?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.340
Or if they're changing careers, what should they go into?

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.320
And a lot of times the advice is follow your passion.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.440
Like, what are you passionate about?

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.800
Like, well, I'm really passionate about soccer.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.100
Okay.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.020
Well, go into soccer.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.140
Like what I've, I think I've seen over the years is a lot of people who are actually

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.900
super passionate about what they're doing.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.760
They didn't go to it because they just knew from the beginning that that was it.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.180
It's like somehow as you get pulled in, as you master a topic and you learn more about

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.140
it, like it, it's like this mastery and understanding leads to passion, not the other way around.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.560
Yeah.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.200
No, I totally agree with you.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.940
So this is something I think about sometimes.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.300
So I realized over the years that there are things I thought I would enjoy doing.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.540
So I thought it was my passion.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.260
So at some point I think like I would totally want to do AI research.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.680
And then I took three months off in travel and I realized it's like I read every day and

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.980
write every day, but I didn't read a single paper in the three months.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.360
So like, it's just not something I enjoy doing.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.100
So I realized that I want to become the person who do AI research, but I don't want to do

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.260
actually be doing it.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.780
Yeah.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.960
So I think those things, you just need to like spend time and think about it and like

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.020
to just observe what you do in the three times you'll know what's so passionate.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.840
And so don't think of passion as something you find.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.640
I think passion is something you cultivate.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.640
So you might not know.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.100
So, so you know, have you ever had this moment?

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.920
Like you study, you learn something and it's like so weird.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.720
You don't understand anything.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.680
It's like miserable.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.320
And it has a gotcha moment.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.900
Everything just makes so much sense.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.160
And it's just like keep doing deeper and deeper into it.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.500
And it suddenly becomes a passion.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.980
Yeah.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.940
So I do think that in the beginning, I think it's really useful to just try a new thing,

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.720
but like, don't just do too short, like give it some time to actually

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.580
actually see how much you learn, how much you grow in it.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.760
And I think it's no, there's no pain.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.060
You know, I just, there's no shame.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.500
It's like leaving something you don't think is for you, but you definitely need to give

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.160
things to Tom.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.020
That's good advice.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.680
Yeah.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.000
A lot of people want to find that thing that they love and just go for it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.580
And I think actually the answer might be just experience a lot of things and then decide,

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.820
right?

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.340
Which is awesome.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.140
So you took some CS courses and did a bunch of writing.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:41.040
And now all of a sudden you're on the other side of the podium, right?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.380
You're doing a little teaching as well.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.840
Yes.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.940
I don't think learning and teaching have to be mutually exclusive.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.260
So I started teaching when I was a student and I started out not because I was an expert.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:51.920
As a TA?

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.060
No, as an instructor for the course.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.940
So I started out not because, I started teaching it not because I was an expert, but rather

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.560
because I wanted to become an expert.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.040
And so in the beginning it was like, so my first course I taught as an instructor was TensorFlow

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.320
for deep learning research.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.960
So at that point, TensorFlow was fairly new and I was using it in my own internship and I couldn't

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.220
really find good training material.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.440
So I went to my professors and was like, hey, can you take a course on it?

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.180
Take a course on it?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.020
And they were like, oh, we don't have time.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.780
Like, you know, for professors, you put their name on the line.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.020
They could have to like, and I was going to have to make a lot of investment to make it

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.280
good.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.800
And they were like, why don't you do it?

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.540
And I was like, what?

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.120
And I was like, yeah.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.660
They have Stanford has this thing that you allow students to initiate course.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.660
So I did it.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.080
And in the process, so it's not really it's like having a group of people who also want

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.960
to learn TensorFlow and learn to quit them.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.540
So I just tried to like anticipate a lot of questions by just Googling a lot.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.420
It was like, I know I spent like half of my waking hours, like a flow or something.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.440
So that's how I started.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.540
Anything now I still continue doing it.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.140
That's cool.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.180
I think you could just learn so much when you try to teach something.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.520
It's a really valuable way to just get deeper and deeper into it.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.800
And this is at Stanford, right?

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.700
Yeah, it was Stanford.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.860
I think it's not so like learning, but that you realize what you don't know.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.980
Because, you know, sometimes you think that you know something and then you start explaining

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.460
to people it was like, you have no idea how it goes.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.260
Yeah, for sure.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.980
The way that I think about it is like if you were, say, a consultant at a company and you

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.680
had a programming problem to solve, like let's say you need to do something with multi-threading,

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.180
right?

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.560
If you find one way that works, you're done.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.920
You move on to the next thing.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.400
Yeah.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.220
But if there's three ways you could have done it as a teacher, you have to know what the

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.000
three ways are.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.120
When should you use one versus the other?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:34.840
What are the three?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.380
These are questions that just a lot of times you don't have time or energy to dig into.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.820
But once you start teaching, you're like, well, I better know it because they're going to

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:41.240
ask me.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.880
There's more ways than one.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.800
How do I do it?

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.300
And why?

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.660
Right.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.080
Like it really just makes you give it like this other perspective on trying to learn about

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.360
stuff.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.800
Yeah.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.440
No, I think there must be like some like teaching rule.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.380
If there's a question you don't want to answer, students don't ask it.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.960
Oh, they can like use.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.420
Yes.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.380
I remember from teaching math classes as well.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.940
Like, you know that they're just going to hone right in on that one thing that you were

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.240
afraid.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.600
Please don't ask me this thing.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.060
I don't totally.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.640
They can smell fear.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.180
Exactly.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.240
Yeah, exactly.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.880
All right.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.020
So you are doing teaching at Stanford right now, but you're also working at a new startup,

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.240
right?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.000
So what are you doing today?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.880
That is a great question.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.040
I have been asking myself a question ever since I joined a startup.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.260
So I think startup life is great.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.620
I think it's so dynamic.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.940
We have been growing so much.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.340
The company has increased in size and multiple times since I joined in December.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.260
So it's been like less than a year.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.620
So it's a blessing.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:43.240
I think when I joined the Snorkel AI, I told the founding team that I'm looking for environment

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.020
where I can learn like different aspects of business because eventually I want to start

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:48.660
my own company.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.320
And they've been extremely supportive.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.880
And so in the beginning, before we launched, we were like very much heads down building the

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.260
platform.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.420
So my job was like entirely on the engineering side, like building out the modeling service

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.820
and like other features.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.860
And then there's a company launch and we suddenly like had a lot of interest from people.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.320
Like I was humble brag.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.300
We had two people.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.420
We don't have time to talk to them.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.820
No.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.220
So we still had a lot of interest.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:19.660
So I think we needed more people to like responding, like just talk to potential customers.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.340
So I have been spending more and more time on that side.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.200
So yeah.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:30.300
So recently I just decided to switch like most of the time on the go-to-market side.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.000
You said your ultimate goal in the long run is to do something on your own potentially.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.660
And those two things you talked about, those are the two really hard aspects of starting

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.320
like one, the technical side, because you have to sort of bootstrap it and get it going.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.020
But the other is like marketing and get the word out, positioning, like all that stuff just

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:51.820
so often on the technical side just gets ignored until you build it and no one comes.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.440
You're like, all right, well now what are we going to do?

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:53.660
Right?

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.940
Yeah.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.120
I think it's definitely, they are both like really different, difficult aspects.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.180
I think like another aspect is like recruiting.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.880
I think like, I think companies can like, like good people can like making a bet higher

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.360
can basically like bankrupt the company early on.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.600
And so, so I think like one reason why I joined the company, this company I'm with is that,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.520
so I look at the teams like, wow, how did you manage to like convince like great people?

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.780
And I'm saying, it's like when I said how they managed to convince great people, I mean,

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.780
how does it manage to convince me to join them?

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.220
I'm just kidding.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.540
I feel like everyone on the team is like, it's pretty great.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.680
But I feel like it's with a strong team.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:29.940
Yeah.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.160
So I think what I learned about startup life is that like, you don't just stick to an

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.920
idea, like from beginning to end, you try out different things and try to pivot.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.820
You try to like, in the beginning you have a hypothesis, right?

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.660
You think that like, this might be something people want, but you don't know for sure until

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.000
you're actually like working with like customers.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.180
So over time you learn different things, you change your ideas or like maybe there's some

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.020
like giant company launching the exact same thing and like, how do you compete with that?

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:55.360
Yeah.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.600
So sometimes it's not about the ideas, not even about the product, but it's about the people

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.400
because like with a strong team, even if you throw out some existing product and it be a

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.940
new product, it can still has a chance of like competing.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.580
But if you have a bad team and it's a current idea proof should be like wrong, that you can't,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.080
you can't really recover from it.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.540
Yeah.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.260
One of the things I think is really interesting about working with small, in a small company

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.000
like a startup is you get exposure to so many different things, right?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.920
You're not just the person that does billing in this way or build that part of like this

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.620
pipeline.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.400
Like you have to really get your hands into many parts.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.860
It's stressful, but also I think you grow a lot if you get that opportunity.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.420
Yeah.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.220
I think, I think it's the discussion people have been talking about like the difference between

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.860
looking at a big company and a small company, right?

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.400
So like at big companies, you have to, you can't, you're allowed to like focus on one

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.720
small thing and go really deep into it and you spend like many, many of the waking hours

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.240
on it.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.580
But as startups, like yeah, many things going on and you have to like maybe like cycle among

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.240
them like quickly.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.440
So let's say like at big companies, like big companies can afford to hire specialists who

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.860
can, who can do one small things really well.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.100
But startups, like a lot of, they might want somebody who can do a lot of things.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.320
Okay-ish, like not like expert.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.240
Yeah.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:09.640
Yeah.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.900
A lot of prototypes, do it quickly, try it out, then work, do something else, find a

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.620
gap, fill that hole, all that kind of stuff, right?

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.020
Yeah.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.920
I think it's good.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.200
Like really depends on like the faces of life.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.200
I know there are people who, who really just want to like keep their heads down and focus

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.100
on one thing.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.480
So, I mean, there's no, there's no shame.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.220
I think I have so much respect for people who can do it as I have so much respect for people

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.240
who can like adapt quickly and learn things quickly and just like build things.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:36.820
Yeah.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.320
You got to find the one that works for you.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.880
So one of the things that you've been writing a lot about, you're working on a book actually,

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.840
is basically about building teams in the ML space and hiring people.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.220
And I think that this is a big challenge right now because so much of the folks in the data

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.200
science space is so hot and so many people are coming from different areas, right?

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:03.000
Like there might be somebody doing ML, but three years ago that person was, I don't know,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.520
working in finance or maybe another person.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.660
She was like a biologist, but she got into programming and now she's doing machine learning

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.800
because she's sort of right.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.460
So it's, I think it's actually a little bit challenging to hire people in this space because

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.720
it's not just, well, show me your machine learning PhD and we'll talk about it.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:20.920
Right.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.140
Like there's probably not that many people in that realm, right?

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.760
Like there's not as much traditional education in the workforce yet.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.200
Yeah.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:35.340
So I think I agree with you that hiring is hard, but I think that hiring is hard right

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.960
now for machine learning for many reasons.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.560
I think the first reason is like, it's probably because companies don't even know what they

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.620
are hiring for yet.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.400
I think because machine learning is like, it's really new.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.780
And if you're like imagining a company, like you have never deployed a machine learning model

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.240
before.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.460
And now you're trying to start a new team.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.760
So you're probably like, what do you need to build a machine learning model?

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.120
And you have no idea.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.080
So you probably come up with some very generic ways.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.700
And like you, like you say somebody who's like doing like state of the art research, somebody

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.140
who can code really well.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:07.920
Yeah.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.880
Somebody who can explain what they are doing.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.180
So it's just like, these people just don't exist.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:12.860
Yeah.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.420
That's a good point.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:18.380
But I think the second thing is that machine learning itself is not new, but machine learning

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.240
in productions, like especially from the explosion of like deep learning CNA 2012.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.560
I think the first major application of deep learning in industry is probably Google Translate

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.980
in 2016.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.940
And since then, a lot of companies have been looking into it.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:38.140
So it means that, so I think like industry is like lagging behind like research, like a

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.580
few years.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:38.800
Right.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.220
So like research like grows and you have a lot of people knowing like how to do machine

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.500
in academic environment.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.820
And then like industry say, oh wait, you can actually use that like to improve our business.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.620
So let's do it.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.920
So like at that time, like, so we're in the phase when companies are looking into it.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.600
But most people who know machine learning comes from an academic environment.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.200
So they are familiar with like how to like do machine learning research, but they actually

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.940
might not be like familiar with like doing machine in productions.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.800
And there are not many people who can teach them because usually you need a hands-on experience.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.840
So we have a very early phase of machine adoption in the industry.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.120
And I think like, so that's why we are liking people.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.460
But I think in a few years, we will have a lot more.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:23.300
And hopefully like understanding of machine in productions plus availability of people

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:28.460
with actually hands-on experience will make hiring less, a lot less difficult for companies.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:28.900
Yeah.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.880
That's really interesting.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.320
I can imagine if I was hiring, say like a couple more web developers or somebody to do

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.640
database ETL, like bring in the data and clean it up.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.080
Yeah.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.600
You already have people in your organization who do that and you can say, well, what do you

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:43.960
need?

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.560
And please talk to this person.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.820
But if you're creating an ML team, like I know there's really large companies out there

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:54.200
that don't have a single person who's doing like productionized machine learning.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.140
So it's like you pointed out, like it's starting from zero.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:02.040
And a lot of times, you know, is that person who you're talking to really competent to make

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.960
that decision or make the right trade-offs, right?

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.840
Or even know what you're hiring the person for.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.280
Yeah.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:06.980
So yeah.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:13.680
So you hire the person for and also like having people to like evaluate the skills can be very,

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.340
very hard.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.640
And so, so I think I say a lot of, so, so, but actually I do see some shift in the future.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.620
So I think like a lot of aspects of machine learning are being commoditized.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.260
So for example, like you're seeing a lot of pre-trained models, right?

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.240
And people is like trained the model for you already and they open source it.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.660
And you have a lot of like pre-built model, like hugging face.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.740
So, so you can just like code API and then you can incorporate like some machine model in those systems.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:45.440
So actually like, so like a lot of tools to allow you like future engineering or like runes-based systems,

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.840
like monitoring tools and deployment tools.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:54.480
So, so I do believe that there's a bottleneck for machine learning in production now will be in the engineering part.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.620
So I'm not saying that we stop doing research.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:00.520
I'm not saying that like a lot less companies will do research.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:07.320
I think that doing like the machine part can be like a few very large established company who know what they are doing.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:13.580
And then a lot of other companies who use machine learning can just like use like existing tools and platforms.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.040
So the challenges can be like engineering challenges and not machine learning challenges.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.480
Yeah.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.840
There's a lot of stuff that's getting pre-built out there.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.960
Like I think Apple ships with some pre-trained models for running on iOS.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.160
You've got like Azure cognitive services, stuff like that, right?

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.220
Where you just, you kind of just bring that in.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.900

Get the insight you've been missing with Datadog.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:16.500
So I guess one question, just thinking, sort of reversing it a little bit,

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.680
I guess you could see it from both ways.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.920
If I was somebody who was looking for a machine learning job

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.420
or I was hiring somebody,

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.900
how much do you think that engineering side should matter?

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.020
It sounds like it's pretty important.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.260
So should, say, being competent with Git and source control be important?

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:31.880
Yeah.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.780
Continuous integration.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.680
Should you know something like FastAPI or Flask or something like that

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.460
to build a service around your model?

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:38.860
Yeah.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.400
What are the skills you think are really important there?

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.160
I think it really depends on what type of jobs do you want.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.720
So I think Zezia, like, I think I want to say the term traditional machine learning

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.200
engineering job, but I don't think machine learning engineering is that old

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.040
to deserve the term traditional.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.420
But I think that people have been using the last few machine engineering

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.560
as in, like, future engineering, creating models,

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.480
training models, like babysitting models.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.840
And I think that part requires quite a lot of machine learning

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.880
and less engineering.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.440
But, like, if you work to, like, set up a distributed pipeline,

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.680
like how should you do, like, how can you process data in a parallel?

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.900
How can you print model?

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.780
How can you deploy model so that it can serve, like,

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.280
a lot of requests at the same time but lower agencies?

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.880
Then you probably need more systems and databases and machine learning.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.580
And if you are in the part when you want to, like, monitor the system,

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.480
like, the maintenance and, like, monitoring,

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.940
so you can, like, how do you, like, push updates without, like,

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.060
interrupting the service?

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.960
Or how do you, if something happens, like,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.280
how can you be alerted when some bad things happen

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.440
and then you can address it quickly or how can you run back the system?

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.180
Then I think a lot of it has, like, it's very similar to DevOps.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.760
So you need a lot more things as well.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.220
Right.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.940
So it really depends on what roles you want, the company you want,

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.080
because I think one thing I noticed is that, like,

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.760
companies have very different structure for their machine learning teams.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.380
So companies like, for example, Netflix,

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.640
so they have this, like, separate, like, algorithm team.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.520
They focus on the aspect, algorithmic aspect of machine learning, right?

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.940
But so, so...

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.820
Yeah, the recommender engine is so important over Netflix, right?

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.160
I mean, that's so central.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:18.480
Yeah.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.580
They even had that million-dollar prize to see who could recommend...

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.720
Yeah, they do.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.500
...movies you should watch next best, right?

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:29.440
Yeah, but it's just really funny because, like, I think, like, these competitions are great,

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.120
but, like, the result is it very hard to actually, like, be deployed.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.680
So, so I think, like, I'm not saying Netflix is not using the winning result.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.160
I'm just saying that, like, for a lot of these competitions, like, the winning solutions are...

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.760
Even though the winning solutions perform well on the little board,

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.620
they tend to, like, be very hard to be deployed because the solution is way too complex

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.080
to be reliably deployable.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.480
Yes.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.240
Oh, interesting.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:53.820
Yeah.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.880
Or maybe it's over-trained exactly on that one thing, and it's perfect at that, but it's

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.240
not generalized enough or something.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.060
Yes, that's one thing.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:05.080
I think that's one thing we have been talking about, like, how just start a competition,

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:10.440
like, leaderboard-driven oriented work is actually not very much close to real life.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.360
Because when you have a leaderboard, right, you tend to have one single objective you

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.240
work toward.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.920
For, in this case, you know, like, how good a model with the best performance.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.060
But whereas in productions, you don't have one single objective.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.980
Like, you might have different stakeholders in the company, and they help as one different

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.440
things.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.920
Like, one person might want, like, hey, we want the best performance.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.060
But then it's like, hey, we want the lowest legacies.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.180
And that is like, hey, how do we can, like, do it in a way that we can show the most ads

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.140
without being obnoxious?

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.180
So there's a lot of things.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.700
And sometimes you just optimize for one thing, like, you can't really go for other.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:49.200
I think it's some interesting example of how, like, a machining model that can do very well

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.000
on leaderboards that's, like, not going to be useful in real life.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.960
So think about that.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.740
Do you remember that, I think about 10 years ago, it was like, so these giant retail companies

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.260
who have been, like, trying to, like, predict whether someone is pregnant, so that they can,

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.400
like, advertise directly to that, right?

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.580
Yes, yes.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.580
So, and, like, someone found out, and then they sent, like, all the baby products to,

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.000
like, this teenage girl, to her family.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.040
And, like, they didn't know about it yet, and now they suddenly know about it.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.760
So that's an example of, like...

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.840
Yeah, they got really angry.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.180
Like, why are you sending my daughter this?

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.140
And it turns out actually she was pregnant, right?

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.060
Oh, my gosh.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.700
That's...

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:24.960
Yeah.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.020
That's not so good for her.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.060
No, no, it's not.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.280
So that's an example of, like, it can be so good, it's creepy.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.380
And you don't want that.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:32.920
Or...

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.140
Yeah.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.580
I think about, like, how we have a machining model that's, like, that can help the users

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.840
to, like, solve their problem really well.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.580
So there are two things that can happen here.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.260
Like, one is that, like, it solves the problem so well, that the user is just done.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.200
They never have to come back to you ever again, and you just lose business.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.300
Or they, like, they solve the problem so well, that the user just loves the system, they keep

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.120
coming back for more.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.640
So, like, it's really hard to find the linear relationship between the model performance

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.880
and business performance.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.540
Yeah.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:04.480
I did really think about the relationship of these, like, competition winning algorithms

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.400
and models and stuff.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.040
But, yeah, that makes a lot of sense that just because it solves that one problem, it might

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.240
not be practical to run in production or to maintain or whatever and evolve it.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:13.640
Yeah.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.020
I think you need to, like...

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:19.400
So I think that's why it's important for people who, like, who are in charge to, like,

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.900
give a good sense of what they want and how to, like, balance between different objectives

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.640
of different stakeholders in a project.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.140
Yeah.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.660
So give me...

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.420
Put the hiring hat on for a minute.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.340
And if you're at a company that does not yet have an internal in-house machine learning

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:41.380
team, but you think maybe you want to, maybe we can analyze all this data we have and we

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.520
can find some trends and do more interesting stuff.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:43.920
Yeah.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.840
And you want to create an in-house ML team.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.480
Like, what advice do you have for those people?

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:47.960
Okay.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.720
So it really depends on who you are.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.740
Like, you know, like, Walmart or, like, McDonald's, right?

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:57.420
You just want to acquire, like, a very promising ML startup and just have an in-house team.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.380
And I think a lot of the big companies are, like, going for that approach.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:01.840
Yeah.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.280
I think another approach is that I think a lot of companies are doing is, like, to transitioning

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:06.940
to ML.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.060
You might want to, like, use some existing talent in the company.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.360
So machining is new, but data science is not.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.060
So I think data science people, teams have been, like, a company has been having data science

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.300
team for the long run.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:22.700
And data science teams also, like, work with data and they do a lot of it.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:27.000
They probably already have access to data and they also try to get, like, patterns from

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.320
data.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:32.380
So I think a lot of teams, like, in the beginning, they transition, like, use data science team

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.800
as, like, hey, why don't you learn machine learning and, like, try these things out?

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.320
Maybe a couple of you could learn PyTorch and work on this project and get started.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.640
You might joke about it, but I think it's pretty much how people do it.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.400
And I think I see a lot of people in data science transition into machine learning.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:54.000
And I think especially now with abundance of machine learning courses, there's just so many

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.560
courses online for free.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.040
Yeah.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.460
I think it's great that people are taking advantage of it.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.800
I was looking up, like, so courses, like, do you know Android machine learning course?

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.660
Yeah.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.980
I haven't taken it, but I've heard of it.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:05.220
Yeah.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.160
I think it has, like, more than 2 million people who have taken the course already.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.220
2 million students, right?

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:10.440
Yeah.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:10.880
Yeah.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.400
Crazy.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:11.800
Yeah.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.160
Yeah.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.100
And it's pretty new, right?

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.000
I think it's pretty new.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.240
Yeah.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.040
That's really crazy.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:15.560
Yeah.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.080
It's new compared to other disciplines.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.360
But I think, like, in machine learning, it's, like, one of the older courses.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.860
So I think a lot of teams do that.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:29.000
And I think, but I think, like, for companies who do that, I think one, too, like, hopes that

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.720
they just, like, to look into the difference between data science and machine learning.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.680
So data science is, like, to look at data, like, the output, like, insight, like, to help

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.000
make decisions about business.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.940
For us, you can predict the, like, how much the customer demand in the future or, like,

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.140
yeah.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:50.140
But machine learning is, like, the goal is to have, like, to build product, to be, like,

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:50.600
engineering.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:55.580
So for data science, like, you want people with stronger statistics skills because you look

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.700
at the data and get insight.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.400
But for machine learning, it's more engineering.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.460
So you want somebody with, like, stronger engineering skill and less that, yeah.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.060
Right.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:09.660
So as a data scientist, maybe your output might be, here's a Jupyter notebook with a Plotly

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.500
analysis of what we're thinking.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.060
Whereas as a machine learning person, your output is, here's the API that gives you the answer.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.060
Yes, you can think of it that way.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:19.700
Something like that?

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.280
Yes, yes.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.280
Something like that, yeah.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:21.560
Okay.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.000
So I think this is a very different focus.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.300
I'm not saying just, like, I'm not trying to make a general statement here.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.080
I'm just saying just, like, just from talking to a lot of people, I tend to notice that,

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.300
like, data scientists are seeing much better statistics, whereas, like, machine engineers

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.280
are much better engineers.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:36.820
Yeah.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.200
Yeah, I've seen that as well in some of the trends.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:39.440
So.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:39.940
Yeah.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.200
It seems totally reasonable.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.200
Let's reverse this a little bit.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.100
So we were talking about if you want to build a team.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.860
And you did point out, by the way, bringing someone in from the inside.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:56.260
Like, I feel like data science, more than software developer, that role needs to be sort of intimately

00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:01.280
familiar with the way that the business works and the way the data is collected and all the

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.900
little idiosyncrasies around it.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.140
And so having somebody who already knows all that stuff, and now you're just like, okay.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:06.540
Yeah.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:11.040
Adapt that to machine learning might be easier than getting somebody who's good, but has no

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.120
experience in the business.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.000
I think, like, I make a living out of, like, saying that I know machine learning, right?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.260
So, of course, I want to, like, make machine learning as hype as possible.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:25.040
But I have to admit that, like, machine learning for a lot of, like, simple models, you don't

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.120
need to learn.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:31.080
You don't need to spend years and years and years of, like, learning to, like, be able to

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.060
use simple models.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:38.000
So I think that's, like, one thing I noticed is, like, it's actually a lot easier for good

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.880
engineers to, like, pick up machine learning.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:43.160
I've done for machine learning experts to pick up, like, good engineering.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:43.840
Gotcha.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.540
Yeah.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:49.480
So, like, if I was to start a team, I would probably try to get, like, really good engineers

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.900
and have them learn machine learning and then, like, apply machine learning.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.620
Then, like, to hire machine learning experts and then, like, having them, like, spend, like,

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.220
several decades to become good engineers.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.620
Yeah.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.100
That's a really good perspective.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:01.600
Yeah.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.080
All right.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.100
So switching the role here to being interviewed for a machine learning job.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:11.260
So you're working on this book for machine learning interviews.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.140
It gives you, like, a sense of sort of if you're going to go apply for one of these jobs,

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:19.480
what are some of the skills and things you might expect to be asked about and so on, right?

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.760
Want to tell us quickly about that?

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.260
Yeah.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.020
So this is a book I've been working on for, like, oh, my God, a year and a half now.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:29.240
Do you know, like, how it has so many great plans for 2020 and none of them happened?

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.800
I think this is what's the case.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.820
That's the case with my book.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.180
I think it has so much great plan for it, like, and then, like, boom.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.500
So, yeah.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.260
So it's a slow.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.140
It's coming along.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:43.720
So I think my book is not just a book for, like, here are the questions they're going to ask you or, like,

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.200
how to answer them.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:51.620
I think part of what I want to do with the book is to have some standardizations or understanding into the process.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.620
I think it's new in the industry.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.940
So it's new for both interviewees and interviewers.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:01.980
So, for example, people still ask me, like, people would be confused, like, what is a machine engineer?

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.500
What is a data scientist?

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.680
Like, what's the difference between big company and small company?

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.040
What is the hiring process?

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.360
What skills do you need?

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:16.300
So I think there's just so many skills that one might need, but usually, like, you don't need all of them for a single role.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.960
So I think my book is pretty, definitely start from it.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.980
It's a different, I think I lost you.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.960
Sorry, I don't know what happened to my network.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.400
It just said that it lost and, like, all my stuff disconnected.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.500
But we're back.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.560
Yeah.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:33.500
So we were talking about the book and you said it wasn't just for people, like, to know what the questions and answers were,

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:38.600
but that it, like, it's such a new industry that it's both new for interviewers and interviewees.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.000
And I think we were going from there.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.520
Okay.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.080
Yeah.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:48.480
So part of the book, it should give some understanding, standardization, and it should be a process of differences between different type roles.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.660
Like, what is a data scientist?

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.060
What is a machine engineer?

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.800
Or what is a research engineer?

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:58.240
Also, like, it's a difference between, like, for example, like, machine engineering and data science and MLOps.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:04.600
So it's going to, like, get a good picture of the process, what skills are needed for each process.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.100
And I see interview and interview pipeline, building pipeline.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.060
Yeah.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.220
And a lot more.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:16.580
Yeah, that sounds, look, we need all the help I think we can get for fixing the interview process.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.400
Oh, my God.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.200
In software development and data science.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.800
It seems so broken to me.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:26.900
I've had some friends who have gone through it recently, and it just seemed really, really rough.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.680
And I actually did an episode.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.960
Wait, let me do a quick search.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.760
What are some of the highlights of the, like, pinpoints?

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:45.700
I think a lot of it is you get asked to work on, like, low-level algorithms, like, explain or create or recreate low-level algorithms, sometimes even just on a whiteboard.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.160
Yeah.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.900
Where, like, you know, go create quick sort.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.100
And then never, ever in your job will you ever go and create quick sort.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.940
Or something like that, right?

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:54.280
Yeah.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.920
Like, you would just go to the list and say dot sort, and it would be done.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:03.080
I interviewed Susan Tan a while ago, back up, way, way, way, in episode 123.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:08.600
And she said, she did a talk called Lessons from 100 Straight Developer Job Interviews.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.840
I think she was in San Francisco as well.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.100
I'm pretty sure if I remember correctly.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.140
A hundred is so much.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.560
She literally did a hundred and then, like, took notes about what worked.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.340
Oh, my God.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.100
You know, you'll get, like, these big, like, homework projects.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:22.140
Yeah.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:22.660
Right?

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.060
Like, work on this for, like, a week.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.880
And then, you know, there's a hundred applicants.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.380
So, like, the energy put into that is often not.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.980
Anyway, I think helping both sides of that story would be really good.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:33.400
Yeah.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:38.960
I would definitely love to, like, read her interview because it sounds exactly like what I've been working on.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.880
I'm curious.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.100
Does she, like, propose, like, what are some things that work?

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:48.060
She did, and it's been, gosh, it's been, like, two or three years since I spoke to her about it.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.300
But I know she had some advice for, like, these things were really bad.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.520
And these things I experienced were really good.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.020
Yeah.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.920
And so, she basically laid out, like, what are some bad interviews I had and what are some good ones and why?

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.820
And I think probably in there you could pull out some good advice.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:11.380
Yeah, this is, like, really interesting because I think, like, before, as I was still, like, interviewing for jobs, I was, like, I have so much to complain about the interviewing process, right?

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:17.840
But now, as a part of, like, a startup and we're trying to build the reading pipeline, we realize that it's really hard.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:23.340
Like, even though we complain about the existing pipeline, it's really hard to come up with something that is better.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.880
So, I think it's just, like, too many.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:31.580
So, the first of all is, like, interviews are just, like, proxy to evaluate somebody's skills, right?

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:31.880
Yeah.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:39.260
So, you know, like, how even, like, so, like, this example, I know it's maybe, like, not very exact, but, like, first of all, I think about dating, right?

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:45.300
You try to find somebody and it's just approximate whether that person is a good fit for you and you might go dating for, like, years.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.620
And you still end up with, like, some bad partner, if possible, right?

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.700
So, like...

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.940
Exactly.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.300
The divorce rate's, like, 50% or something, right?

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.960
Like, we're not totally getting this nailed.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.460
Yeah.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:01.600
So, I think, like, for job interviews, like, you try to, like, admittedly, like, the stake is lower.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.240
It's, like, for a job, not for a partner.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.200
But you still have much less time, right?

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.480
Like, you only have, like, a resume.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.980
Everyone say you shouldn't keep the resume longer than one page.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.860
You have one page of that.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.600
And then you maybe go on LinkedIn, social media, local things.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.920
And then you have, like, a few hours.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.420
Like, it's really hard to, like, get a good picture from it.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.740
And a lot of it's, like, biases, like, because interviewers are humans.

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:27.100
And even though we try not to, like, we learn, we are taught that you shouldn't let biases,

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.500
you shouldn't decide, like, judge people beyond that.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.420
But something we, like, we grew it.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.440
Like, something is, like...

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:33.640
Yeah.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.120
We just do it without even, like, being conscious of doing so.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.420
And also, like, it's very different for different people because something that might work for

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.380
a group of people might not work for as a group of people.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.560
So I think, like, for example, like, we have been trying to debate on take-home challenges.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.760
So a lot of candidates told us, like, oh, my God, interviews, like, so stressful.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.200
Like, one-on-one is really hard.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.780
Why don't you just give a take-home challenge?

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.980
Like, just make it, like, I don't know, make it hard.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.560
We're going to spend, like, a day on it.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.860
When it be done, and you can see how good a way we are.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.120
But then, like, we thought about it, and we talked to people.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:10.040
And then we realized, like, for people who have a lot of responsibilities outside of work,

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.100
like, especially, like, for example, women or, like, people with small kids,

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.560
they can't spend a day, like, do or take-home challenges.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.020
So I think, like, it's what might work for me.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:18.440
Yeah.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.820
And if they apply to 100 jobs, then all of a sudden that's half a year or something like that, right?

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:23.680
Yeah.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.400
Yeah.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.460
So it's very hard.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:29.680
So some companies, some people told me that, oh, they like this concept, like that company,

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.800
when they bring you on to, like, as an intern-ish for, like, a month, they pay you.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.480
And then if you do well, then you can get a job.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.340
And somebody say, oh, that's great, because now everyone gets a chance to, like, show how good they are at the job.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:46.120
But then not everyone can afford to, like, just go on a job without any commitment for, like, for a month, right?

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.560
And it's going to be totally excluded on immigrants.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.320
Like, for example, if somebody needs visa sponsorships, they can't just go and work for it.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:52.660
Right.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:59.420
It's a very precarious situation if your presence in the country is based on, you know, you have to have a job.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:03.120
And if it lapses for more than a month or two, then you've got to leave.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.920
That's really stressful.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.180
Yeah.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:04.620
Yeah.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.440
So I think it's really hard to find something that can work for everyone.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.120
Yeah.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.480
So a couple of thoughts.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.480
One, it's been a very long time since I hired anybody.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:18.360
But I used to help with hiring people to do training, people who would become trainers to teach, you know,

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.100
basically for professional development for software developers.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.520
And we would obviously go through the resumes and see if they made any sense.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.800
And then we would just do a quick, like, 30-minute call.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:33.340
And I would say, okay, so imagine this person says, I'm a Python expert and I specialize in Flask.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.860
All right, we're on a Zoom call.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:35.980
Share your screen.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.900
Build me a Flask app that has one function that returns JSON.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.360
If I give it two numbers, it adds them.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:47.240
I mean, like, anybody who's ever worked with Flask should be able to knock that out in five minutes.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:52.000
And you can tell from, like, one minute in, is that person on that path to, like, get there?

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.820
Because they know you start with import Flask and then you create app equals Flask.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.560
Or are they just flailing about, right?

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.840
They just have no idea.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:07.300
And there's no way that they can both be an expert in Flask and not be able to create, like, a Hello World app in it, right?

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:15.640
And so, I mean, that was the first sort of filter we used before we actually would ask them the equivalent of, like, here's a take-home project or something.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:22.160
It's just like, show me live that you're semi-confident with the tools you claim to be, like, top-notch in, right?

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.120
And that actually worked pretty well, I think.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:30.580
I was blown away at how many people would claim to be, like, I've done five years of this and I'm a super expert and I'm ready to teach it to other people.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.940
And then they can't even begin to touch it.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.360
So, I think that's an interesting interview approach.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:42.980
But I also find it's, like, for, if we do interviews, it's very, like, tailored, like, specific, like, overfit to a specific tool.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:48.620
Then we might find people who are really good at one tool, but then don't really just, like, scale, like, right at a range of scale.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:57.460
And I think that for startups, if, like, if a fast-changing company where you need to, like, have a lot of, like, new problems and have to keep, yeah, we will have to, like, keep learning new things.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:02.060
If you just, like, get someone who's really good at, like, one thing and they can't generalize the other.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:02.560
Sure.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:09.060
What I was trying to more find, what we were trying to discern was they said they were expert at this thing.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:09.580
Yeah.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.120
Are they actually, like, how much can you trust?

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.500
So, if they can show they're expert at this thing they said, then probably the other stuff that they said they're pretty good at.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.920
They're probably also in that realm.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.300
Yeah.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:25.640
But if they're, like, really far from, like, how they describe themselves in one axis, then they're probably not really going to be in a good fit.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.220
So, yeah.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:26.740
I don't know.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.400
It worked okay.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.540
We didn't do that much hiring.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.540

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:37.780
The other thing that I wanted to bring up is, did you hear that Guido Van Rossum just joined Microsoft?

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.200
Oh my God, yes.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.580
I think, yes.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.060
Yeah, I was like, it was really interesting.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.200
What was the thought on it?

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.580
So he said, basically, he's been retired for six months.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:48.780
He's like, I'm really bored with this.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.840
I want to go back to do something.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.720
There's a ton of cool open source stuff going on there now.

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:58.940
And, you know, he gets to work with some of the other language teams and make Python, basically just focus on Python and be around it.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.300
Yeah.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.480
And that's all interesting.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.820
And I think it's actually kind of a big deal that that happened.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:07.240
And it's like a really big contrast from Microsoft 10 years ago that this is even possible.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:16.760
But the thing that I want to bring up specifically now is somebody on Twitter asked him, so did you actually have to send in a resume, Guido, before they hired you?

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.620
And he said, yes.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:18.940
Yeah.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.460
He had to send in a resume.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.100
He went through a bunch of interviews.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:28.240
The interviews make sense, but he had to send in his resume and he had to provide his degree he got in university.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.940
And like his transcript, like his grades and stuff he got in college.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.200
That's what I don't get.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:40.300
And I'm just thinking like, who cares if he got an F in literature or didn't?

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.860
Like, look what he's accomplished since then.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.500
It doesn't matter.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.760
But that's just another one of these hiring things, right?

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.820
Well, we got to check the box.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.040
We need his like university degree in transcript.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.400
This is so funny.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.760
Or this technical fellow.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.220
Does that remind me of like a few years ago?

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.060
Do you know Malala?

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.820
She was like the youngest Nobel recipient for Nobel in Peace?

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:00.820
No, no, Malala?

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.540
Yes.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:01.980
Yes, I do.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.220
Uh-huh.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:02.620
Yeah.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.060
It's really funny because like at the time she was like, oh, she wanted to study at Stanford.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.140
And like Stanford was like, yes, but what's her SAT score?

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.540
And everyone was like, she's like youngest recipient in Nobel Prize for Peace.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.840
And you're asking her like, what's her SAT score?

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.500
I thought it was just like, yeah.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.500
Just going to cram them through the bureaucratic pipeline.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.460
It's so funny.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:22.720
Yeah.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.520
All right.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.100
So what are some of the other takeaways that you're like hoping to give in this book?

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:32.100
And you also have a chapter that's open on GitHub People Can Download, right?

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:32.540
Yeah.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.760
So this is the chapter.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:38.760
So I think one part of the interview a lot of people ask is a machine learning system design.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:46.640
And so the question is usually like, yeah, like if you want to like build a system to do that, how would you do it?

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.640
So it's very design high level kind of questions.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:43:00.340
And I think, so first of all, one question could be like, if you try to build a system to predict what keyword is trending on Twitter, then what would you go about it?

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:02.460
Like what is considered trending and blah, blah.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:12.340
So I think this question is very interesting because it's usually like try to measure the understanding of like the different part of the system and not just like machine learning.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:22.720
But also find that questions can be like pretty, very hard for especially junior candidates because they don't have a good graph of like what is a production environment.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.920
So some companies.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.360
Yeah.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:30.020
A lot of times you have to see examples of that or have built examples of that to know like, well, these are the five pieces we got to put together.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.520
And then you do it, right?

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:31.920
Yeah.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:43.660
So originally I wrote it as part of the interviews book, but then as I start writing more about it and I learning more about it, it was like, oh my God, there is like so much more in machine learning system design.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.180
So now it's actually become like a full blown book on its own.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.200
So that's why it's taking me longer.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.920
And I'm actually like teaching you a course on it, like machine learning system design, just on that part.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.700
Oh, that's cool.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.400
And you're teaching that in January.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.020
Is that right?

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:57.360
At Stanford?

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:57.900
Yes.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.020
And I'll be in January at Stanford.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:00.460
Yeah.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:05.180
It's a bit strange because I'm not sure how teaching online is going to go.

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.540
I'm a bit, a little bit nervous about that.

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.000
Yeah.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.180
It's not the same as standing in front of the class and having that experience.

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:11.740
That's for sure.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:12.160
Yeah.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:18.240
But most people told me that it's a different experience because some students like it more because especially for the introvert.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:24.340
Now they can just like ask questions anonymously without having to raise their hands and having anyone stare at them.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.540
So it's going to be interesting.

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.700
I'm looking forward to it.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.140
Yeah.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.300
It should definitely be interesting.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:28.960
All right.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:36.520
I think we're just about out of time, but maybe just real quickly, you could give us the elevator pitch on Storkel, Snorkel AI and what you guys got going on there.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:37.460
Ooh.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.560
Okay.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:43.240
So I think like for the pitch, I think you can just say why I decided to join Snorkel.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:49.240
So it's funny because it's a startup that comes out from Stanford AI lab and I have heard of them for a while.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:53.360
And when it first approached me, I was like, oh my God, another startup from Stanford.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:57.100
I know it sounds super smart, but I was like, oh, startup AI, whatever.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.880
But then I came across the paper.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:05.620
So most of the founding teams are like PhD students and they have been publishing a lot.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.420
I read one of their papers and I was like, this is really smart.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:15.640
So the key idea for their paper was that like, instead of manually label on the data, right?

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:22.320
You can have some heuristics and causal heuristics into programming functions and apply to all the data at once.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:30.800
That's the really hard thing about training your models is you get like all the state that you have to say car, bicycle, ball, tree, right?

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.980
And you just got to like go through it and teach it basically.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:33.260
Yeah.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.480
So you notice a helpful like labels.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.620
Like for example, you see like an email with a spam or not spam, right?

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.520
You probably notice you probably have some heuristics.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:48.480
Like, hey, if you say like, hey, you're going to have like, hey, please send me money to like Nigerian Prince or something like you're going to spam.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.260
So, so you have some like heuristics in the brain.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:55.300
Like, so if you can find what you end cause of heuristics and you don't have to manually do it on at once.

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.900
So I think that's the algorithm.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:02.540
So like how should I combine because some heuristics are going to be noisy and like overlapping and they can't see each other.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:08.420
So the current algorithm was like how should I combine one of them and I generate like what the techniques of.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:12.880
most likely to be correct gradsures because you don't have gradsures actually compare gradsures.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:19.020
So then you generate the set of gradsures and then you, and so they, they open source support.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.400
So like anyone can just go on GitHub and use it.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:25.240
So I went to the core and thought like, wow, these people are like good engineers.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:31.000
Because you think of like PhD students are like bad engineers, but then they, their core is like good, very clean.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.600
They have more testing and everything.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.740
Like unit tests.

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:34.320
Oh my God.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:34.780
No.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.280
So, no, no.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:48.940
So, so I think the product now is a, it's not just a part because actually a lot of thing of snorkels is thing of that labeling part, but we actually be like a full non like a end to end platform.

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.880
So we have your format data to like modeling training.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:47:02.540
Like we do a lot with like monitoring analysis because we believe that you can't, machine learning is because it's changing fast and each updates on models constantly.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.660
And so we believe in iterative development.

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:08.280
So like you have a, you, you train model and you see it and it's not good.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.700
So you go back and see what's wrong and how do you improve it.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.860
And like you manage more data.

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.460
So, so we version everything as a process, by the way.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.360
And so.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:15.920
That's cool.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.760
It's like agile data.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:23.300
We don't use agile yet, but if it's one of the buzzwords of sales and maybe we can adopt it.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.260
Yeah, I know.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:24.700
I'm just teasing.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:25.660
It's one of my buzzwords.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:25.960
I'm just kidding.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.060
Oh my God.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.240
Please, somebody from snorkel, please don't fire me.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:37.760
But, but yeah, so, so we do a lot of, so it's an end to end platform for people to build machine, AI applications.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.100
And it goes on data model, monitoring analysis.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.620
And I think it's pretty dope.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:44.340
You guys should totally check it out.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:44.800
Yeah.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.340
Right on.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:45.600
Awesome.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:51.880
Well, it sounds like a cool company to work for and definitely nice applied machine learning stuff.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.200
So building tools for machine learning folks, right?

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:54.560
Yeah.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.140
Awesome.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.400
I think it's for machine learning folks, but I think like.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:57.640
All right.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.900
We recently wanted to lower the entry barriers for people to build AI applications.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.340
So I think like, so our platform is actually no code.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:09.160
So like you have the option to just build an application without any code at all.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.960
But we also have like our SDK.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:15.300
So like for people who want more like flexibility, then you can also like code.

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:15.720
Yeah.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.360
Very nice.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:16.800
All right.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.000
Well, good luck with the whole company and the startup.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.440
Hopefully it takes off and does well.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.060
It sounds nice.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:21.400
Yeah.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:21.960
Yeah.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:22.420
Thank you.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:23.960
So we're pretty much out of time, but yeah.

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:28.580
Thanks for all the advice on building machine learning teams or getting to be part of one.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:32.340
Now, before you go, there's always the two questions I ask at the end of the show.

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:37.200
And one is if you're going to write some code, some Python code, what editor would you use these days?

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:43.400
So sometimes I really want to be smart and say it's like I use Vim, but actually just use VS Code.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.180
VS Code is definitely the most popular answer these days.

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:48.060
It's all good.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:54.920
And notable PyPI package, like something, some Python library or package that you've come across like, oh, this was so cool.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.580
People should know about X.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.400
I'm not sure.

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.820
Is this, so, so, so, do you know about, I think it's like Paper Mill.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.800
So it just allows you to format.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:03.660
Yeah.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.720
I think it's pretty cool.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.480
It allows you to do a lot of experiments with like Jupyter Notebooks.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.140
I think.

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:08.760
Yeah.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.280
And Paper Mill comes out in Netflix.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.800
So it's a neighbor of yours.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.320
And.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:12.860
Nice.

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:13.360
Yeah.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.300
The idea is you can almost treat Notebooks like functions, right?

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:20.920
Like you can pass arguments to them, run them and get like something out and then even chain them together.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.520
Yeah.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:27.880
And one of the things I heard was really nice about it is if you create sort of data pipelines of one notebook going to the next, the next.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:34.320
And if something goes wrong, like the notebook actually contains like all the data that came in and what it tried to do and how far it got.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:34.800
Yeah.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.100
And it's like almost a record instead of just like server failed with 500.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.080
Like, no, like here's all the details.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.060
You can go back and look at it.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:41.260
Yeah.

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:41.980
It's pretty dope.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.100
I think, I think it's really cool.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:47.020
I think there's been like so many exciting work in the notebook space.

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.920
I think it's a real like Streamlit.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.380
I think Showlit is like, it's like really cool.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.800
Like you create like very quick applications.

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.340
I mean, there's just so many.

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:55.840
Yeah.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.780
That's really nice as well.

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:57.000
Yeah.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.160
What's your, which is your favorite?

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.080
My favorite.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:00.820
Oh my gosh.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.880
You know, there's all these different ones that always blow me away.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.380
I go through so many of them.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.720
One that I came across recently that was pretty neat is called a back off.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.940
Someone told me about that.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.600
And back off what you do is just put a decorator on one of your functions.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.560
You say, if I get this kind of error, like this type of exception.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.080
Yeah.

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.780
Like wait five seconds and then try again and then wait 10 seconds and then try again.

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:26.400
So if you're doing like testing against like an API and you get like a too many requests error,

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.520
you can say instead of fail the test, just wait one second and try again.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.520
This sounds pretty dope.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.000
I think I need to check it out.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:33.520
Yeah.

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.060
Yeah.

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:34.300
Yeah.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:38.560
It's super easy to use, but it kind of solves that problem of like mostly reliable, but not

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.760
all the time reliable stuff.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:43.520
Do you like stars things on GitHub when you see repos that you like?

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.140
I do.

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:44.720
Yeah.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.120
I star stuff all the time.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:46.380
Yeah.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:50.480
Can I just go into those, can I see you go to the star list and let's see like what have

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.800
you been like looking at?

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.260
Yeah.

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.380
So github.com/Mike C. Kennedy.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:59.680
And let's see, I'll pull up my stars and see where are the things that I've starred?

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.600
There we go.

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:04.380
So the things that I have up here right now, that's a really good question, by the way,

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.560
like really cool way to look at it.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.600
So I have pip chill, which is like pip.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.380
You know, if you do pip freeze, it'll show you what you've installed.

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:15.580
Pip chill will like pip freeze will include everything that was installed, including the

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:15.980
dependencies.

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:21.500
Pip chill will just show you just what you manually installed, not the dependencies, which is cool.

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:22.100
Nice.

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:28.460
Then link it, L I N Q I T adds like link functionality to the Python language is cool.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.140
I love the name, by the way, pip chill.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.960
Pip chill, yeah, it's so good.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:40.900
And then I have a FastAPI chameleon and FastAPI Jinja, which adds like those templating languages

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.640
to FastAPI as a decorator.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.820
Oh, you saw MB black is cool.

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.380
Yeah.

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:45.880
Yeah.

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.540
MB black adds black to notebooks.

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:47.760
Yeah.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.880
So those are the ones I've starred recently, I guess.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:50.780
I'm so funny.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:51.960
So those are all good.

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.460
So you saw like a lot of FastAPI, but still still a lot of flask.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.040
Do you have like, you prefer one of another?

00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:58.900
Yeah, I do.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.480
I really like FastAPI.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.760
I've been liking it a lot.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.820
Oh, it's brilliant.

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:03.400
Yeah.

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.440
I think it's, yeah, it's so brilliant.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.020
It takes all the cool modern features of Python and puts it together.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.400
So let me make one recommendation for you.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.420
Check this out.

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:15.240
I just want to get your reaction to this for people as a data science machine learning

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:15.600
person.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.460
Hand calcs.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:17.220
What is that?

00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:19.020
Have you, have you seen hand calcs?

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.320
No.

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.000
So hand calcs is crazy.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.540
So what this does is you write, you create a Jupyter notebook.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.080
Yeah.

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:28.500
And you write some sort of math equation that is actually just the computation.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.880
And then you can ask it to show you, and it'll show you as if it wrote it in LaTeX.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.260
What?

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:37.060
Like step by step, like how, yeah, like how it solved out the problem.

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.640
So it'd have like, like the nice square root.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:43.240
So if you're doing some kind of like computation that's somewhat technical and hard.

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:43.560
Yeah.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:48.860
In Jupyter, it'll actually show you like what you would put into like a math textbook or a

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:52.880
physics textbook to derive the equations and even the steps you might take to go from what?

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.040
Can it do proof for you?

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:59.020
I don't know how far it can go with a proof, but if you just go to like Google hand calcs.

00:52:59.020 --> 00:52:59.980
Wait, how do you spell it?

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.640
There's a bunch of animated GIFs.

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.900
How can you say the name?

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.220
H-A-N-D, C-A-L.

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.240
H-A-N-D.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.120
C-S.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:07.380
Like.

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:07.920
Oh.

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.320
C-A-A-L-C-S.

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.480
Like hand calculations.

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:11.920
Okay.

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.060
Is this, is this from corner first?

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:14.940
Yes.

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:16.100
Oh, that's dope.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:16.680
And.

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:17.320
Oh yeah.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.440
If you just page down through it, you can see like all these amazing steps.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:24.780
You can like render like symbolic mathematics and like the steps between various things.

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:24.960
Yeah.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.640
It's really, really.

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:28.000
So if you were doing like complex calculations.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:28.860
Whoa.

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.540
That you want to make sure you got right.

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:36.520
Like reading the Python code to do it is harder than like reading the symbolic mathematics of it.

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:37.700
Wait, how does it do this?

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.220
Yes.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:38.960
I have no idea.

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:43.580
But it uses like Sempy and a bunch of other LaTeX and all sorts of crazy stuff.

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:47.500
So as a data scientist, like this thing is killer, I think.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:48.760
That is pretty dope.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.420
Nice.

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.560
Thanks for showing me.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.720
I'm going to show it to my friends.

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.300
Yeah.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.180
Yeah.

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:53.560
There you go.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.260
So there's, there's a topical recommendation.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:56.760
How's that?

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.280
Nice.

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.060
That's helpful.

00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:58.740
Thank you.

00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.940
That's dope.

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.980
Of course.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:01.500
Cool.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.340
All right, Chip.

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:07.340
Well, I think we're about out of time, but I just want to say thank you for being on the show and sharing all of your advice.

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:14.100
And I guess one final question, if people are interested, if they're out there looking to do some machine learning, are you guys hiring?

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:14.820
Yes.

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:18.160
We are hiring a lot, actually.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.400
That's actually one of our challenges.

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:27.160
Like how to give on, yeah, hiring a large quality of like quantity of very good people.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:27.560
Yeah.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:31.800
That's, that is definitely a challenge, but we'll put a link maybe over to like the jobs page or something.

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.380
If you want, people can check it out.

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:37.960
