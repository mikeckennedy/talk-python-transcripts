Corey Schaefer has been building his YouTube channel of tutorials for many years.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.380
He recently has made the big shift from taking this hobby project and making it his full-time job.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.880
You'll hear about how Corey made that transition, what it takes to go pro,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.800
and even a little bit about the similarities between my work with Talk Python and his projects.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.260
This is Talk Python To Me, episode 169, recorded June 29, 2018.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:44.520
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

Corey, welcome to Talk Python.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.320
Hey, thanks for having me.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.780
Yeah, it's really great to have you here, another Python creator, putting out content for the whole world, huh?

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.040
Yeah, actually, I've been doing that now for about only a few months, so I'm kind of new to it, but it's been fun so far.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.200
It's going to be an exciting ride for you, I know. You've been doing it for quite a while, and it's picking up speed.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.560
That's awesome, and we're totally going to dig into those sorts of things,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.100
but before we get to them, of course, let's hear your story. How did you get into programming in Python?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.480
So I got into programming probably a little bit later than most people that you talk to.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.020
I really started out, I went to Marshall University for computer science,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.000
and really that was one of my first exposures to computer science and programming in general.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.200
And I kind of just went and just chose a major.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.540
My dad was a computer programmer, so I chose that.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.480
But for the first few years there, I wasn't too passionate about it right off the bat.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.700
And it wasn't until kind of towards the end of my college career, I got an internship down at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.840
And a lot of people down there were super passionate about their jobs and loved what they did, and that kind of rubbed off on me.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.400
So whenever I went back from my last semester of college, I was really into it,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.860
and that's when I started doing most of my self-study and doing my own applications and things like that.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.900
That sounds so exciting.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.120
Like Kennedy Space Center, that is really cool.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.740
First few years I was born, like a few miles from that place, and I lived there.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.620
And it just seems like such a special place in both the tech science world and sort of in history in general.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.580
What was it like to work there?

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.860
It was great, yeah.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.440
It was an amazing place.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.800
Even if you weren't doing programming, it was just an amazing place in general

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.100
because there's so much that you can see and do there because you can just go out on the beach and watch a space shuttle launch.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.680
So I got to see a few launches, which was one of the coolest things I've ever seen in my life.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.000
And, yeah, and even just driving through the Space Center, seeing all the history, you can go to the old launch pads,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.340
and they're kind of – some of them are grown over with weeds and stuff now,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.220
but it's kind of neat to see where all this history was built.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.760
So, yeah, it was an awesome place to work.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.900
One of the things that kind of motivated me whenever I worked down there was, you know,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.300
I'd always put it on a pedestal in terms of people that can work there, which is true.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.220
I mean, you definitely have some of the smartest people walking around there, but at the same time,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.140
there's also so many average people there too who have just got there from studying over the years.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.500
And that kind of rubbed off on me that, you know, there's no reason I can't be here too

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.800
if I start going and putting some effort into this stuff.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.380
Yeah, that's a really awesome lesson.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.320
I think that's a great lesson that, you know, a lot of people learn at different stages in life that, like,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.860
wait a minute, this seems so high level and so impossible, but I see a bunch of sort of normal people that just worked really hard.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.960
I could do that, right?

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.520
That's a great takeaway, I think.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.100
Yeah, awesome.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.400
So what kind of programming did you do there?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:50.700
Whenever I was there, I was doing mostly some, I think I was doing C++, but I wasn't very good with C++ at the time.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.000
It was a lot of, and also I got, it was just an internship, so also I was getting, they used Linux systems,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.580
and that's one of the first times I'd use Linux.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.460
So I spent a lot of the time just kind of learning my way and navigating around and writing some command line applications for them to parse.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.340
I think we were parsing some XML files and things like that, but yeah, nothing too complicated.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.240
That's cool, but basically that experience.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.160
Learned a lot when I was there, though.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.900
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.000
So that experience sort of inspired you to like, hey, this programming thing is actually pretty awesome.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I'm getting into it more.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.080
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.080
So yeah, whenever I got back from there, I had one semester left in college, and then after I graduated college,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.780
that's whenever I got my first programming job.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.600
Probably spent a couple years doing some stuff that wasn't necessarily things that, you know, knowledge that lasts too long.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.200
Like, for example, for a couple years, I was doing Adobe Flex programming.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.500
I don't think Adobe Flex is even around anymore.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.040
That was basically to build Adobe Flash applications.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:54.820
There was a time where that was like, you could get some seriously good consulting jobs, like at the early stages of interactive web.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.220
What is that, like 96, 97, 98 type frame?

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.140
Gosh, that was not that long ago.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.220
I caught it on the very tail end of when JavaScript kind of replaced it.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.940
So it was probably around 2010, yeah.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.960
Okay, cool.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.340
Yeah, so only about eight years ago.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.660
And then, so after that, I got my first job where I really felt like I was learning some technologies that were going to be around for a while.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.600
So I got a full-time job as a front-end developer doing JavaScript programming, doing GIS web applications and mapping applications.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.500
And that was at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.680
And from there, that's when I also got exposed to Python.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.140
We were building some back-end scripts using Python.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.100
And so that's whenever I wrote my first Python scripts.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.380
And so that was probably only about five years ago that I started doing that.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.700
And, yeah, I kind of fell in love with it.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.880
That's, I started, you know, compared to JavaScript, I was looking at Python.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.660
And I was like, man, this is a language that I can use to write scripts that move files around in my file system.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.900
Or I can write desktop applications or command line applications.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.420
And back in, there's just so much.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.060
It's such a broad language and so much that there is to tackle with it.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.440
Yeah, that's one of the great things.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.520
It's so broad, right?

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.180
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.940
Yeah, for sure.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.940
Awesome.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.220
And so you have what I would consider a slightly unusual job that you're doing day to day.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.220
So why don't you tell people about the big move that you've recently made and what you're up to now?

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:26.600
So, yeah, about whenever I started learning Python about four or five years ago, that's whenever I started making YouTube videos.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:33.120
And it kind of sounds counterintuitive to say that I was making videos on Python while I was learning Python.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:40.320
But really, that's originally why I started making the videos was just to kind of solidify what I was learning and put that out for other people.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.780
I would just keep notes of any time I was learning something.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:52.660
If it wasn't exactly clear to me, then I would go back after I learned it and say, OK, well, why wasn't I understanding this when I went through it first?

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.800
And is there a way that it could have been explained to me that would have made me understand it faster?

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.380
So that's how I started making my first videos.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.580
And, yeah, so I've been doing those videos for about four years now.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.400
And I got a full time job working with Python out at the University of Colorado Boulder for about the past three years.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.860
And I was making videos pretty much the whole time on the weekends.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.600
And for the first couple of years, it wasn't it was basically just a passion project.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.940
It was stuff that I was doing and not making any money with it at all.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.740
I think after the first two years, I was looking at my earnings.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.100
I was making like less than a dollar a day after two years.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.880
So it definitely wasn't a money making scheme at the time.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.120
But, yeah.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:39.220
And then two years after that, it just kind of grows exponentially and got to the point where I started thinking, man, maybe I can do this full time.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.200
And a couple of months ago, I was able to do that.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.760
So, yeah.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.440
So, yeah.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.520
Now my day to day is now that I'm doing it full time, it really opens up a lot of time to work on larger courses.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:56.520
And because before it was hard working on the weekends to do a large course because it's really hard just to keep the continuity from weekend to weekend.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.320
And be able to know where you picked up or picked off and stuff like that.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:01.900
So, yeah.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:09.340
Being able to do it every day and be able to keep my mind where I left off last time and it really helps doing those larger courses now.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.320
That is awesome.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.780
Yeah.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.220
Yeah.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.840
So, yeah.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:19.940
The day to day basically is as far as work hours goes, it's pretty much broken up into either creating videos that I already feel comfortable teaching.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:28.560
So, that's videos that I'm ready to record right now and a lot of research for videos that I want to record but that I need to brush up on the topics first.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.540
And now for the past couple of months, I've also been spending a little time just learning how to do this as a business now.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:44.800
So, that's kind of the more boring stuff in terms of learning, picking out different health insurance and retirement plans and if I want to make a different account for taxes and boring stuff like that.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.500
Man, I was just juggling taxes earlier.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.300
I can very much relate.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.040
First of all, congratulations.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.060
That's an awesome move.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:52.480
Yeah.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:52.940
Thank you.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.260
Yeah.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:53.560
Yeah.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.680
It's been great so far.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.680
I'm sure you're really, really happy about it.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:09.760
I think this transition that you're talking about here is really tricky for people with computer science degrees or this sort of developer training because nobody teaches you about marketing, accounting, about business structures, about like all this stuff.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.380
You're like, wait a minute.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.300
How do I have a retirement account again when I don't have a company that gives me the 401k, right?

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:15.940
Like, oh, yeah.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.840
A self-employed person, Ira.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.680
That's apparently a thing I need to learn about.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.060
So, you know, sort of what's that experience been like?

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.080
That's probably been the hardest thing, yeah, in terms of just learning how to get the information out there.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:36.960
I've actually gotten – I'd say that a lot of that has been kind of lucky in terms of like I'll put out content that I think is good.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.820
And if it's good enough, a lot of it's been kind of free marketing from other people.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:49.300
So, you know, the Python weekly email list was big when it got on there a couple of times, and I really saw a lot of people come in from that.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:55.380
People posting posts on Reddit, and, you know, one of those going popular will bring in a couple thousand people here and there.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.420
And, yeah, so just stuff like that has really helped with marketing in terms of people just sharing the content online.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:10.420
As far as self-marketing, it's – yeah, that's been hard because I'm not a very good designer in terms of, you know, designing images for my courses and things like that.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:25.220
So that's been a lot of self-study just going through other online courses and learning how to create all that and put it out there on social media, making a Facebook and a Twitter and all that stuff to push that out to people who are interested.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:31.100
Yeah, and I feel like coming from the tech space that marketing feels a little dirty, almost shady, right?

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.520
You're like, I don't really want to do marketing.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:32.880
Yuck.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:43.580
But at some point, like, if you were going to do these types of things that you and I are doing, you more or less have to go, like, okay, well, there is a positive side to – I'm trying to help people.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.940
I'm trying to spread the word about this stuff, but I have to go through these steps or nobody will come, right?

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.320
It's not like the field of dreams.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.380
That would be lovely.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.620
But it really is, right?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:11:00.200
Yeah, that's been one of the hardest things is, you know, some people are so good at selling themselves and, you know, saying, you know, if you take this course, it's the best course out there.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.320
Trust me, and stuff like that.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.060
And it's been hard for me to kind of push stuff like that.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.300
Yeah, and I find, honestly, like a lot of times it's not, which is really rough, right?

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.440
So you feel like, well, if I do the same thing, I'm going to be grouped in the same category.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.580
So it's a hard balance to strike.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:21.280
So I want to run an analogy by you with your NASA background and what you've just gone through.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.780
So people ask me sometimes, like, how do you get into these places, right?

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:31.240
Like, I'm doing full-time my podcast and the courses, and you're kind of doing a parallel path in YouTube.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.220
And the story is very much the same.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.200
Like, I started the podcast, and I would record from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.020
And then do the editing until 1 a.m.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.540
And then wake up and go back to work or do it on the weekends.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.480
You know, just squeeze it in whenever you can.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:51.140
And at some point, it gets good enough that you can actually put more of your time into just that, right?

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:59.660
And so I think a good analogy for people who are thinking about these types of things is when a rocket takes off, you know, they talk about max Q, right?

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.500
You familiar with max Q?

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.420
I don't think so.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.400
What is that exactly?

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.740
So max Q is the concept where when the rocket is taking off, it's accelerating faster and faster.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:14.540
And it's going through, like, the low atmosphere at high enough speeds that it's the maximum aerodynamic force on the rocket.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.480
Oh, okay, yeah.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.620
And as it's trying to break free, it gets harder and harder.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.760
It has to actually slow down.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.880
Like, they throttle down the engines for, like, a few seconds after, like, one minute.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.920
And then it kind of breaks through that, and it, like, takes off again.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.760
And so going through these processes is very much, I like this max Q.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.400
Like, the more successful that you get and you still have your job, the more work you've got to, like, double down.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.880
And it just gets harder and harder and harder until you get to the point where you can, like, break through that.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.000
And you're like, okay, now I can focus on the one thing.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.300
And the pressure, at least, of, like, trying to juggle everything lets up.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.020
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.040
I think that's a great analogy.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:57.160
Yeah, that's, I'd say the hardest part of this whole transition was probably the last six months of work where I saw the goal line of almost being there in terms of being able to do it full time.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.640
And it felt like I needed, you know, a few more good courses to put out there.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.100
But, yeah, it was just a lot of work there combined with the work that I was doing full time.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:12.520
And it's, yeah, that's definitely the most stressful part is that last little bit before you actually do break through and go full time.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:21.540
Yeah, and probably, I don't know about you, but that last couple months when you sort of decided, but you're not quite ready, the motivation to keep doing your regular job well is hard to keep there, yeah?

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.620
Yeah, you're just thinking about, you're just thinking about, okay, as soon as I get this in place, I'm going to be doing this other thing.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.820
And, you know, you're kind of out the door.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.380
It's really hard.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:36.000
So I do want to dig into some of your lessons and series and stuff, and we'll spend a lot of time on that.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:50.660
But I guess kind of while we're still on the subject here, maybe talk about, like, lessons that you learned in going through that process of going out on your own as a person working in, you know, sort of trying to teach people in the software development field and in open source and stuff.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.900
What went right?

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.600
What went wrong?

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.820
Like, what advice do you have for people?

00:13:53.900 --> 00:14:01.800
Well, one piece of advice I would have is that it has to be something that you actually are really passionate about and something that you enjoy.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:08.820
Because, like I was saying before, I've had a lot of people contact me just about, you know, kind of as the money.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.240
They say, hey, can I do this and make a lot of money doing this?

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:11.760
I would love to.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.220
And you definitely can after some time.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.560
And I'm sure it's different for every person.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.960
But for me especially, if I was just doing it to make a living and just doing it to make money,

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:26.880
I would have definitely given up in the first two years just because, like I was saying, I was making less than a dollar a day after two years.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:33.540
So if it was all about the money, then I would have, yeah, definitely given up way before it was actually started bringing in anything.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:41.200
So the first thing I would say is that it just has to be something that you actually enjoy doing and something that you probably would be doing in your free time anyway.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.780
And I really liked doing the videos and I liked the feedback that I was getting.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.080
So it was more about that than making money in the first place.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:55.580
So that would be my first piece of advice is just that, yeah, it has to be something that you're basically going to be doing anyways.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:00.640
So whether that's an open source project or a blog or, you know, making videos, anything like that.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:08.500
Yeah, I guess if you really want to make money, maybe just move to New York or London and just get a stock trading job automating it with Python or something, right?

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.660
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.500
If you're not going to love it anyway.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.700
Yeah.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:24.520
Other than that, if it's about if people are looking into getting into teaching specifically, one thing that I've kind of learned over the years that and it's kind of evolved, too, in terms of how good you are at it.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:30.840
But one of the best things you can do when you're actually teaching courses is and it's a skill that is kind of hard to come by.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:37.480
But you have to kind of be able to put yourself in the position of mentally of somebody who's seeing something for the first time.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.060
And that can be harder than people think.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:46.440
Because, you know, if you have all this experience and all this knowledge, it can be hard to actually, you know, remember what it's like to see this for the first time.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:52.980
And it's easy to skip over a lot of stuff and and not anticipate what kind of questions people ask or where people get tripped up.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:16:01.680
So if people are specifically looking into teaching, that's one thing that I would recommend, too, is just try to get better at putting yourself back in that position of of learning something for the first time.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.980
I think that is super undervalued.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:10.360
And you talked about how it was kind of counterintuitive that, hey, as I'm learning Python, I'm actually creating the videos.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:16.800
And I don't know about you, but one of the feelings I had was like, I really don't know enough to, like, put myself out there as an expert.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.200
But I know I can talk about these things.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.080
So why don't I just do that and, like, you know, see how it goes.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:22.320
Right.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:30.200
But I think this starting earlier in that process actually lets you connect with your students a little bit more.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.240
You're like, yeah, just last week, I couldn't get this thing to install.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.460
And here's what I actually had to do to make it work rather than, of course, you just, you know, do these other these few commands and it works.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:38.720
Right.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.560
So you're just you know, you're you're sort of the pain is more recent.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.220
And so you can help people.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.020
You can sort of have a little better empathy, I think.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:46.200
Yeah.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.820
And I think that's great advice, too, is not to be worried about putting yourself out there.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.220
It's hard.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.640
That's a hard stepping stone to get over.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.760
I definitely had that also.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.980
I definitely was making videos worried that I would get questions about things that I knew nothing about.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:05.780
And and but yeah, after you put out the first videos, everybody's real appreciative that you just are showing them anything that was a hurdle for you.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.500
Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.540

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.720
Let's talk about some of your video series that you have going on.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.740
Like you said, you have four years of videos and I didn't count, but it's many pages of little thumbnails.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.900
So it's quite the set of series and stuff that you put out there.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.980
And of course, we'll link to your YouTube channel.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:01.780
But let's talk about some of the series that you put together that you liked and we'll dig into them a bit.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.360
Okay, great.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.120
Yeah, sounds good.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.240
What's the first one you want to talk about?

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:09.480
The most popular series on the channel right now is probably my object oriented series.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.260
I think that's my most popular video.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.380
I'm not sure how many views that has right now, but it's above all the other ones.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:23.680
I think that people enjoy the object oriented series because it's kind of taught a little bit different than some of the other courses that are online in terms of.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.100
So, for example, we show a lot of real world applications for what you're learning in that course.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.920
And by real world applications, it's not something that I put together that's a real world example.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.400
It's really actual code like in the standard library.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:45.220
We'll open that up and see like, okay, if we're doing like static and class methods, like so class methods can be used as alternative constructors.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:57.600
And so we'll open up the daytime library and see, okay, well, and for people who don't know what an alternative constructor is, basically it's multiple ways of creating an object or instantiating an object.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:03.980
So, you know, date times can be created by the default way as just saying, okay, I want a date that is the year, month, day.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.760
But you can also do, usually they start with like a from keyword.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.300
So from timestamp or something like that.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.420
So there's multiple ways to create a daytime object.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.740
And those are all class methods.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:19.860
So we open up the standard library, look through there and say, okay, well, here is a class method and here's how date time is using it.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.520
And this is, and it's doing basically exactly what we just learned in the course.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:29.860
And that kind of gives people confidence that, you know, there's millions of people using this code and the daytime module.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.640
So they know it's going to be something that is, that applies to the real world, what they're learning at the time.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.420
Yeah, that's cool.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.500
Certainly digging into the standard library code is a neat way of doing it.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.300
You know that it's been optimized for performance.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.740
It's been, like you said, used by countless numbers of people.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.580
It's pretty interesting.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:55.800
I think certainly class methods and static methods are, they're interesting in that they're almost the same, but not exactly the same.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.880
And so it's like, well, why would I use a static method over a class method?

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.200
Do you have any thoughts on this?

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:10.600
So a static method, yeah, static methods can be a little confusing because static methods don't take self or the instance or the class as an argument.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.520
They're basically, they're basically just regular functions.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.420
And so people don't really, so they have nothing really to do with like the instance or the class.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.020
It's really just, it could be a separate function almost.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.960
And people don't really know when to use static methods.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:31.060
But it's, it's really a function that, yeah, it doesn't operate on the instance or the class, but it does have a relation to the class.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.400
So like the example that I use in the, in the series is we're building like an employee object.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:45.640
And I'll say, okay, well, you might have like an is workday method, like to check, to pass in a date and see if that is a workday or, you know, something like that.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:51.200
So checking if something is a workday, it doesn't actually work on the employee instance or the class itself.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.280
It could be a separate function altogether.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:21:01.820
But it's kind of related to that, to that object in a way that it might be some functionality that you want to pass on whenever somebody input, imports your class that you created.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:08.220
So that's kind of what a static method is in the sense of why you might include that in an object or in a class.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:16.440
And yeah, the class methods are basically it's, you're working instead of passing in the instance, like a regular method, you're working on the class itself.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:29.940
So, and like I said, you can use that to set class attributes if you want, or a lot of people use them for alternative instructors where you can take in different arguments and then return that class with an instance of a newly created class.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.620
That's right.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.040
Almost like a factory method.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.880
Like if you're going to allocate an instance of that class in the class method, you need to know that it's not.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:43.000
If you derive from it, then you want to create the derived thing, not the other thing.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.540
But the fact that the class, the CLS thing is passed in, you could just sort of, you know, call that and get to the constructor.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.340
Yeah, exactly.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:49.800
Yeah.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.540
Pretty interesting.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.020
Yeah.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.360
Okay.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.160
So what else do you cover in the object oriented series?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.920
So we also do inheritance.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:01.540
So inheritance is another one where we kind of go through the lesson, but then we also open up the standard library and see how it's done.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.680
So I never knew how to pronounce.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.360
I never have actually heard this spoken out loud, but the work zoo library, the one that.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.320
It ships with a dependency of flask.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:10.680
Uh-huh.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.680
So yeah, we, we, we look in there and we take a look at their HTTP exceptions.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:24.940
And that's a great example of inheritance used well there because they have their base HTTP exception, which gives you all of this functionality.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:33.880
And then each higher level exception, like a 404 not found or a 500 internal error, they all inherit from that base HTTP exception.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.440
So they get all of that code for reuse.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.800
And then basically they just change like the status code in the method or in the message.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:48.520
So it's a, it's kind of a neat way of seeing how a real world library is actually using this efficiently.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.000
That's a really great example.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.080
And I think that's one of the places where inheritance makes tons of sense in Python.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:04.840
I'm, I'm a big fan of classes and inheritance, but I do feel like they can be a little bit overused in Python because sometimes it's just used for like grouping common behaviors.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:14.060
And we could just as well do that in a module with some module level functions or variables, just as, you know, much say like a class with a bunch of static methods, right?

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.220
They're kind of almost equivalent.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:21.400
It's just different ways, ways of thinking, but around exceptions, like it really makes a big difference, right?

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:28.480
Because in your accept various type, you use the inheritance to drive your error handling basically.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.260
Yeah, exactly.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:29.640
Yeah.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.360
So I really like that.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:30.800
That's awesome.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.900
Another one that I think is probably really popular in, in your set of videos is Python for beginners.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:43.920
Like we all want to, you know, maybe write the most advanced, like deep look inside of this aspect of saying like an ORM or something.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.120
But the truth is most people are just getting into Python.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.600
Like it's a growing field.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.500
So most people are coming into it.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.820
They're not looking for like that super internal deep dive thing.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.040
Right.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.340
So this beginner series is probably pretty popular.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:56.700
Yeah.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.520
The beginner series.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.280
I think that's my second most popular series on the channel behind the object oriented.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:16.400
And it's kind of funny because it took me a long time to put a beginner series together because originally I was only going to do videos where I didn't think that there was, you know, I thought that other tutorials were kind of lacking in and things like that.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.680
And there's so many good Python beginner series is out there that I wasn't really going to tackle that.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.340
And not only on YouTube, but just kind of everywhere.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.520
There's some great resources for learning Python.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.820
But I think a lot of people will, you know, just kind of get used to a specific instructor.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:40.500
And they, you know, even if you recommend a class elsewhere, they'll say, OK, well, you know, I'd really like, though, if you would teach it.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.400
And so so I put one together and gave in after a couple of years.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.000
And but, yeah, it's a popular course.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:51.880
So we go over, you know, just basic installation and how to set the Python path on Mac and Windows and Linux and things.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.900
That's where a lot of people get tripped up.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:01.060
And also so we touch on basically the data, all the basic stuff, data types, loops and conditionals.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.380
But once we get up to functions, we kind of try to tie all that back together.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.940
And again, we pull up.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:15.160
We basically write a function that that will check how many days are in a month given a year in a month.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.320
And that's basically a function that's already written in the standard library.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.300
I think that's in the calendar or calendar module.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.760
Maybe I can't remember exactly.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:28.320
But, yeah, we go through that and kind of learn or use everything that we learn to build up that function.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:37.780
And then when it's all said and done, we can open up the standard library there and see, OK, well, we just basically wrote a function that that a lot of people use on a regular basis.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:47.460
So so in that beginner series, I think it's really awesome that you actually start with import anti-gravity because that's both fun and instructive.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.060
Like, wait a minute.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.740
Why did importing a thing actually cause an action?

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.480
Isn't that more of a declaration and not a behavior?

00:25:53.480 --> 00:26:02.900
Yeah, that's one of the more popular videos on there is where we go over imports and kind of show what the sys.path is and and how to append to that path.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.320
Or you can set the Python path in an environment variable.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:13.640
And also, yeah, the import anti-gravity is one part in that series where we say, OK, well, we're importing this module and it does something cool.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.640
It opens up our web browser.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.120
Let me interrupt you just for a second, Corey.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:22.560
Maybe not everyone has has actually typed import anti-gravity into their Python ripple.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.340
So if you're listening and you could do that, stop for a second and type import anti-gravity inside the Python ripple.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.640
If not, tell people what happened.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:43.980
Yeah, basically, it's kind of an Easter egg in Python in the sense that it's not super useful, but it opens up your web browser and just kind of sends you to one of the XKCD comics that is kind of talking about a little comic about Python on there.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.200
That's that's kind of funny.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.700
So, yeah, it's super, super easy.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.440
It's just import one line and then it opens up your browser and goes to that comic.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:27:07.440
I think it's really instructful, though, because it's instructful because when you talk about things like the pattern for, you know, if Dunder name equal equal may under main then invoke this behavior like that stuff doesn't really register with people coming from something like C++ or C#.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.160
You're like, wait a minute.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.500
What is this weird construct at the end?

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:21.520
But this sort of going through this experience is like, oh, I see actually how functions and classes get defined and how things get imported and brought into my namespace and all these sorts.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.320
It's like really it helps to break the paradigm that is incongruent with Python.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.680
People come for this other languages.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.460
Yeah, exactly.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.020
Yeah.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:39.980
And it makes it super easy to like even if you're wondering how that imported code works, then I mean, you always have the opportunity in Python to just look underneath the hood.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.480
So if you want to, you know, see, OK, well, what is this module doing that?

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.560
I just, you know, it's opening my browser and opening this comic book.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.740
But how is it doing that?

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.300
So then you can go into the standard library and just look at the anti-gravity file.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.740
And it's basically two lines.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:59.120
It just kind of imports the web browser and then, you know, uses web browser dot open on that comic.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:07.700
And that kind of makes people feel like once they know how to look at that other people's code, they can say, OK, well, now, you know, now I've learned something here.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.200
So now if I want to open up a web browser to my own web page, then this is how you do it.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.320
So you can always dig deeper and look under the hood and see what's going on.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.160
I think that's another really interesting thing with Python as well.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.020
Yeah, that's a really cool way to kick things off.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.380
What else do you talk about in that series?

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:39.560
After the so after we go through all the data types and conditionals and and for loops and everything like that, and then the importing and taking a look a little bit at the standard library in terms of, you know, how to how to do basic things with the standard library, like work a little bit with dates and the random module and the math module.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.080
After we do all that, it's kind of open ended after that.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.740
So I end the series at a nine part series after we learn how to import.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.340
And from there, I basically tell people, just like we were talking about before, how Python is such a broad language.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:57.120
And after you learn those fundamentals, you can pretty much take it anywhere that you want.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:07.100
So, you know, if like I didn't want to continue the series and, you know, teach them about file objects next, like it was the next, you know, obvious thing that people should learn.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:14.440
Really, after that, they can you know, if they want to learn how to work with file objects and they can do that or if they want to learn to work with a database and they can do that.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:23.200
So after that first nine videos, then it's kind of broken up to I kind of logically ordered the videos in a sense of what I think would be good to learn next.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:29.220
But I tell them that from that point on, they can basically skip around and and learn whatever specific subject they want to learn about.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:34.060
Yeah, that's one of the challenges of teaching Python is so many people use it for different things, right?

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.880
Like some people may be learning it for data science.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.960
And so they want to learn all about, you know, that side of things.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.380
Maybe you're learning for web.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.600
So you got to learn about frameworks and databases.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.800
Maybe you're learning it for DevOps.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:51.640
And if you're in one class of people, you do not want to be learning about DevOps when you're trying to do data science.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:58.820
Like it's just like, you know, there's it's one of the real things that's making Python grow so fast is people coming from all these different disciplines.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:03.340
But it's really interesting to see different ways of working with Python.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.640
You know, you've got like the data scientists working with Jupyter Notebooks in this sort of exploratory fashion.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.780
I've got the web developers building like really structured architectured things with unit tests and code coverage.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.240
And it's kind of cool to have them all coexist.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:16.960
Yeah, exactly.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.120
That's also one of the challenge.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:19.400
Yeah.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:28.900
Like you were saying, one of the challenges with teaching Python, too, is, you know, whenever you say that, you know, Python, a lot of people kind of expect that you kind of know every aspect of Python.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.180
But, yeah, there's just so much so much to cover that.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:32.740
Yeah.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.260
If somebody.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:40.320
So, for example, my previous full time job, I was basically doing a lot of web service back end work.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.440
So, that's kind of why I started with the Flask course as my first course that I put together whenever I first went full time.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:52.200
But, yeah, and things like data science and machine learning are things that I want to cover in the future.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:58.360
But those are things that, you know, I'm going to have to, you know, buff up on myself because there's just so much there.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.420
And, yeah, so much to learn with it.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:00.800
For sure.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.080
I think that's an interesting segue to the next series that you put together.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:13.540
Because both with the podcast and with the courses that I'm doing, at some point it hits a limit of, like, I have totally tons of experience doing this.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:22.640
And I can just do this off the top of my head where it gets into the point of, like, you know, I've never actually dug into that aspect of what I'm trying to teach people or try to interview people about.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.060
And it becomes quite the research project, right?

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.120
So, that was sort of the story with your Flask one, right?

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.420
Yeah, the Flask series was the first one that I put together after I went full time.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:40.740
And I kind of made a mistake whenever I first did that because whenever I first quit, I kind of saw this huge chunk of free time.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.560
And I was like, okay, well, now I can start working on large series.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:51.260
But probably in hindsight, what I should have done is put together a lot of one-off videos that I could slowly release while I was working on that large series.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.160
Because, you know, a lot of people had found out that I went full time.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:10.860
But then it took me about a month of, you know, doing some research and putting together a blog that I thought, you know, had a lot of features that people would be looking for, like uploading profile pictures and an entire authentication system and setting password reset or email resets and stuff like that.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:16.460
And so, yeah, it took me about a month to, you know, research that and record it and edit it.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.800
And it came out to be about eight hours worth of content.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:25.040
And, yeah, so, yeah, that was one series that it's pretty popular.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:29.900
It kind of takes a Flask application and you can kind of see how an application like that will evolve over time.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:39.480
So, we start out just by, you know, using the default Flask that you can get from the documentation, the hello world, and just in a single file.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:46.320
And then build that up to where, okay, well, if something gets a little more complicated, then it's, we can't really hold it in this single file anymore.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.420
So, now we have to break it up into packages.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:53.300
So, then we start using packages to simplify imports and things like that.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:33:04.800
Oh, and to give credit where credit is due, where I learned a lot of that stuff with the imports and circular dependencies and things like that was from a lot of talks by Miguel Greenberg.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.640
He does, I think he's been on the podcast before.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.280
He does a great job with Flask applications.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:15.020
And he has a mega Flask tutorial that he put together that's, you know, more advanced than even the series I did on it.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.580
So, yeah, he does a great job with those.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:18.740
Yeah, Miguel's series was really cool.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.800
And I love the way that he sort of revamped it recently.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.100
So, yeah, I think your Flask series is quite interesting.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:32.280
And it's probably worth talking just a little bit about, like, how much time and energy does it take to put together one of these things?

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.140
So, you said it took for eight hours of published content.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.800
It took you a month of full-time work.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.800
That sounds about right to me.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:50.320
But I'm not sure everybody who comes along understands how much effort goes into creating these short, relatively short little bits that come out the other side.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.140
And it really depends on what you're teaching, too.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:34:00.720
I mean, it's kind of similar to, like, as an analogy, I'd probably say it's kind of similar to, like, writing music or something like that.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:06.160
You'll hear interviews with certain people who say that, you know, it took them forever to just write this one song.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:13.420
And then a lot of people say that they just kind of sat down and it just started, you know, coming out and was everything kind of poured out in one session.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.960
And it's kind of like that with this.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:21.100
Like, sometimes it takes me longer to put some videos I can put together, you know, an hour.

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:25.400
And it just I can record it all on one take and get there in no time.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:34.440
And then sometimes it just takes a while to get all these pieces together and make sure that I'm teaching it in a way to where I'm not, you know, repeating the same topics too much.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:42.400
And that they're that we're kind of touching on all the topics that people would want to learn about in terms of polished, finished application and things like that.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:55.460
So it kind of one of the things that took me the longest was just it's been so long since I've touched front end development that I wanted the, you know, I wanted the finished application to look nice so that people could have a nice application once they were done.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.480
So a lot of that time went into, you know, relearning some JavaScript and CSS.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.840
And that's not even stuff that we really touch on in the video.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.060
It's just a code snippet that I hand out and say, well, you can use this for the CSS.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:10.800
But even that took a while to put together just to make it look presentable.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.820
So, yeah, a lot of work, a lot of hidden work goes in that a lot of people don't see there.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:20.760
This portion of Talk Python To Me has been brought to you by Rollbar.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.440
One of the frustrating things about being a developer is dealing with errors.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:33.460
Relying on users to report errors, digging through log files, trying to debug issues, or getting millions of alerts just flooding your inbox and ruining your day.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:40.200
With Rollbar's full stack error monitoring, you get the context, insight, and control you need to find and fix bugs faster.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:44.200
Adding Rollbar to your Python app is as easy as pip install Rollbar.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.440
You can start tracking production errors and deployments in eight minutes or less.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.620
Are you considering self-hosting tools for security or compliance reasons?

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.180
Then you should really check out Rollbar's compliant SaaS option.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:05.560
Get advanced security features and meet compliance without the hassle of self-hosting, including HIPAA, ISO 27001, Privacy Shield, and more.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:06.940
They'd love to give you a demo.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.640
Give Rollbar a try today.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.320
Go to talkpython.fm/Rollbar and check them out.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.760
Yeah, I agree.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:22.700
I think when you talk about the people who just – or the times in which you just sit down and stuff just flows out, you couldn't do that from scratch, though.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:28.260
That happens because you're kind of swimming in these ideas and in these spaces where this is like all around you.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.920
And then eventually it crystallizes in your mind.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.060
You sit down and it comes out.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:41.500
But if you just took a random person off the street, right, they probably wouldn't have that happen because they haven't been thinking about it for a month before they decided to work on it, right?

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.500
Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.820
Yeah, you definitely have to know the subject well before you sit down and do that.

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.660
But yeah, that's – I'm sure you probably have the same thing with teaching courses.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:58.280
But I've got folders and folders of just thousands of ideas where I have kind of started writing videos and then stopped and then will start again.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:04.500
And then kind of whenever I'm actually ready to record it, I piece all those together into one finished course that finally comes out.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:11.780
But yeah, just even piecing those small pieces together and setting down over time and writing those, it takes a long time if you were to actually add it up altogether.

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:12.800
Yeah, for sure.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:20.700
I have a Google Doc that I think has 63 full course ideas in it, 63 different courses.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.440
And I'll go back and I'll pull stuff out of there.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:28.480
But people are suggesting interesting new courses to me faster than I can – that list is growing.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.460
It's not shrinking even though I'm doing it all the time.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.180
I guess one final thing to round that out.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:43.680
Like I just saw a comment on Reddit saying about my 100 days of code course saying, oh, the course is only 17 hours of like polished edited video, right?

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.420
Like how can this be for 100 days?

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.900
I'm just like, you have no idea, man.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.500
You have no idea.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.440
You know, it also comes with like 80 hours of exercises.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.240
So there's your 100.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:56.580
But it took me, Bob Belderbos, and Julian Squira.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.040
It took us three and a half months each.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:05.740
Like that's a full year almost of one – if you did it as one person of just to come up with like that content.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.300
There's like some serious, serious commitments you got to make here.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:13.700
Yeah, I'm sure that, you know, the hours that are actually edited down when it's all said and done too.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.940
Like I'm sure you have the same experience.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:29.860
But like whenever I said that there was about eight hours of Flask finished content, that was edited down probably – I think those unedited videos before cutting out all the dead spots was about 22 hours of content.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:35.180
So I actually only end up using about a third of everything that was actually recorded.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.120
So yeah, it takes a while even to cut those down.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.700
Yeah, it's quite the thing.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.460
All right.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.940
So let's touch on the last two because they're both really interesting.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.320
One is decorators.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:49.160
I feel like decorators are quite mysterious to most people, many people in Python anyway.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.000
Now that's only one video, but it's kind of funny.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:04.840
I get a lot of comments in the comment section of that video that they say it's kind of like YouTube inception because it's – because in the decorators video, I basically say, okay, well, we're going to do decorators in this video.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.440
But if you haven't learned about closures yet, then you might want to go watch my closures video.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.000
And then in the closures video, I say, well, okay, we're going to learn about closures here.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.280
But if you haven't watched my first class functions video, then you might want to go watch that first.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.760
So people kind of get down this rabbit hole.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.860
But yeah, after – so yeah, first we kind of teach people about first class functions and what that means.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:28.080
And basically that means that you can just pass a function around like any other variable.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:40.880
So if you can set a variable equal to a function or you can either execute the function and set it to the return value or you cannot execute the function and just set it equal to that function ready to be executed.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:48.240
And then when it comes to closures, you kind of use that same concept where you can return.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:53.220
So within a function, you can return an inner function waiting to be executed.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:59.240
And that inner function will kind of remember the context in which the first function was run.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:06.620
And then decorators builds on that to where you actually pass in a function and add functionality dynamically.

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:09.900
So yeah, I mean I can totally understand why it's a confusing subject.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.340
It took me a long time to wrap my head around it too.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:19.200
So yeah, it's confusing just in terms of how much is going on and you kind of got to piece these things together.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:26.240
And even after I've taught that video, you still run – and I'm sure this is like this with everybody.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:38.020
But if you're reading someone else's code and you run into a complicated decorator, then you kind of got to sit down and be like, okay, let me map all this out here and see exactly what's going on.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:43.720
It's definitely not super intuitive, but it's very useful once you have that down.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.620
Yeah, it's definitely useful once you learn it.

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:49.380
But yeah, it's a bit of a mind-blown sort of thing.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:57.480
The last series or video that you talked about is something I've been thinking a lot about lately as well is how to volunteer your skills as a software engineer.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.580
And I feel like software engineers are almost modern-day magicians.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:08.380
So much of the world is technical or interacts with technology and devices.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:18.360
And we're the people who can kind of wave the magic keyboard and then something comes into existence that solves one of these problems or something along those lines.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.200
We have the skill to do that, right?

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.680
And so how – if you see problems where you're like, well, these people just knew a little programming.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.200
This would just not be – this could totally change things.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.980
What do you talk about in this one?

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:34.960
So yeah, that video, it's – that's a video that I did several years ago.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.300
And it's a video that I really like a lot, but it's not very popular.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:43.760
And I think the reason it's not very popular is just because I think when I released that video, I only had like a few hundred subscribers.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:49.080
And it's not very often that people go back years to see what videos I was making back then.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.420
So that's one that now that I have a larger audience, I think I'd like to remake that one.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:42:05.720
But yeah, in that video, I basically talk about when people think about volunteering, they – especially as software developers, you might not think that you can actually volunteer using your skill set.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.300
You might think that you have to do something else.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:11.960
But yeah, there's tons of things that people who have a tech background can do.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:27.060
So one of the first things I mentioned is at senior sitters or assisted living homes, you can go in – and this isn't exactly software related, but you can go in and just show people how to set up emails or connect to Wi-Fi.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:33.300
Because it's kind of a misconception that older people don't really care about technology or don't want to use technology.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.120
But in my experience, I did that for a few years ago.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:51.720
And you go in and they definitely want to stay connected and they want to get pictures of their grandkids and set up their email so that they can keep in touch with family or learn how to subscribe to their favorite online news source or anything like that.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.300
That's one way for – as far as tech people.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:43:06.040
As far as it's – as far as being more software related, I also talk about how you can build websites for free for certain organizations that might not be able to actually afford to hire somebody.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:11.660
So you can do websites for maybe a pet shelter or a local farmer's market or something like that.

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:12.360
That's a cool idea.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:22.920
And one of the things so many people who are getting into Python need before they can actually reasonably go get jobs is some experience and something they can point at and go, that thing?

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.080
I built that thing and here's what it does and here's how this company is using it.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:37.600
Here's a way if you've got some free time that you could do one of those projects and it still benefits you very directly in that like when you apply for the job, say, for Django or whatever, you go, yeah, I use Django.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.320
Look, this thing I did over here and maybe they maybe learned it from your channel or something.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:42.720
Who knows?

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:47.580
That's definitely a great way to have some things added to your portfolio.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:58.980
I get that question all the time, people asking me, what is a real-world project that I can do that a computer or that a corporation or an employer might be interested in?

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:11.820
And usually, yeah, usually I tell them that like one of my top recommendations is to build a website because when you build a website from scratch, you get so much, you get your hands involved in so many different areas.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:22.240
So, for example, you do the back end, which is probably going to be in Python if you're listening to this podcast, but you can also do back end websites and Node.js and PHP and things like that.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:26.780
But you also get exposed to the front end doing JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.040
If you host the website yourself, you get...

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.600
Maybe Linux and Docker, yeah.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:39.440
So if you're hosting the website yourself, you're going to get exposed to Linux and setting up, you know, system security and how domain hosting works and everything.

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:46.080
So, yeah, doing a website is a great way for people to build up a portfolio because you get exposed to so much.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.200
And not only that, but it also helps you realize what you like the most.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.140
So if you, you know, if you liked doing...

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:59.220
And that's kind of what happened to me is once I started doing back end web work with Python, I realized, hey, I think I want to do this instead of front end work now.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:01.700
So it's, you might not know it until you try it.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:09.040
And it's the same thing with, you know, maybe somebody will do, put their website up on a Linux system and they really like doing the system administration type of stuff.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.340
And then they go and do that full time.

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:18.520
So not only is it a great way to get a portfolio built up, but it's also a great way to kind of identify where your strong points are and what you enjoy the most.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.440
That's great advice.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:26.040
One of these sorts of examples that people did in a volunteer sense that I thought was pretty cool is something called Humanitarian Toolbox.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.100
It's at htbox.org.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.940
Now this, I think, I think the project is mostly a .NET project.

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.660
So Python people might not really care to contribute, but maybe it'll inspire you.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:47.160
It's like a thing that the Red Cross and other organizations like them can use for like hurricanes and earthquakes and stuff like that to help connect people and victims and sort of after stuff strikes.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:47.840
It's pretty cool.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.040
Yeah.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.040
They're kind of similar to that.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:56.060
There's a, if you go to GitHub, I think it's under, it used to be under GitHub showcases, but now I think it's under GitHub collections.

00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:01.560
And I've never actually contributed to any of these projects, but I saw it in my research for that video.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.680
And it's kind of the same.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.240
It has, there's one section that's called Made in Africa.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:17.280
And it's a lot of, you know, open source software that people are using over there to stay connected so they can do, you know, yeah, emergency response or SMS type of systems where they can message people back and forth.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:22.400
And setting up that infrastructure is, yeah, would be a great thing to work on.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.240
So it sounds kind of similar to what you're talking about with the Red Cross.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:25.760
That's awesome.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.960
I put the Made in Africa link in the show notes for people.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.300
Cool.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:28.760
Awesome.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.160
All right.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:35.200
So that rounds out the video series that we are going to, the ones we're going to cover, at least for the show.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.380
But you have a whole bunch and people can come check them out on your YouTube channel, right?

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:38.760
Yeah.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.260
Yeah, definitely.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:39.700
All right.

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:48.600
So in the last bit of time that we got, I think I want to talk a little bit about some of the mechanics of just being successful on YouTube.

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:52.620
So you touched on a few things like how to, you have to enjoy it, right?

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:55.160
You can't just go in there for money.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:59.060
You talked about how it took a long time before you saw any success.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:12.940
And I think one of the things that is, as human beings, especially people who are human beings who are excited about a thing you're about to embark upon, it's really hard to understand the non-linearity of these types of things, right?

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:16.860
Like you worked on your channel for a long time before it started to see growth.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:22.400
I worked on the podcast for a long time before it was anything that would reasonably put my daughters through college.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.640
But then it does, right?

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:30.680
But you've almost got to have this irrational belief that if I just, I'm not there yet.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:35.940
I know it's been six months, but I'm just like, yeah, we're going to be way more than $10 next month, I promise.

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:36.980
Right?

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.740
So it's an interesting thing.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.280
So you do have to enjoy it and basically have to do it anyway.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.600
It's like, I would do this anyway.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.960
Hopefully people enjoy it, right?

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45.540
Yeah, exactly.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:45.880
Yeah.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.900
So what other advice do you have?

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.320
Yeah, I'd say that's the biggest piece of advice.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:56.300
As far as YouTube and teaching in general, so first of all, yeah, like we were saying, you have to have patience.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.700
But you also have to have some consistency.

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.720
But you also don't want to be tied down by that consistency.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:11.900
So like, for example, you know, if you get on and look up YouTube advice on how to be a successful YouTuber, for example, one of the top things you always see is to be consistent.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:18.840
So like, you know, a lot of people like to put out like a weekly show, like, okay, every Wednesday I'm going to release a video.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.020
And I think that's great advice.

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.360
And definitely I wouldn't say not to do that.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:31.860
But also don't be afraid to break away from advice like that as well, because I try to be consistent in terms of releasing, you know, a week or every other week.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:35.940
But I'm not tied to that so much to where I sacrifice the content.

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:43.220
So if you have like a deadline coming up and it's like, okay, well, I told people I would put this out, but the content's really not that good.

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:48.960
Then I would sacrifice the deadlines to make the content better because the content's really the most important thing.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:59.720
You want to put out something that you're proud of that you think is going to actually teach people and not just some, you know, quick video that no one's really going to care about just to meet a self-imposed deadline.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:13.360
So, yeah, I'd say for blogs and for, you know, YouTube or any kind of teaching or any kind of content creation, content should be the first and foremost thing that you think about whenever you put stuff out.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.440
Yeah, that's really interesting.

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.300
I think it's good advice.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:25.120
You and Dan Bader had an open session at PyCon covering some of these ideas, and I was hoping I could make it, but I was at my booth doing my booth thing.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.720
So I couldn't go, but you said you learned some interesting stuff there.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.080
What was that like?

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:35.700
Yeah, so that was an awesome experience for me because, you know, this was my first year at PyCon.

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:39.200
And, you know, usually when I do these videos, I'm just behind the computer.

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.920
I'm not like, you know, interacting with creators all the time, other creators.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:47.600
And so that was a really cool session in terms of just bouncing ideas off of each other.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:53.580
And it was interesting, too, because it's the first time that I've actually been included in something like that.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:57.600
Because, you know, whenever I was learning Python, I was like Al Swigert was there.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.440
He's the one who wrote Automate the Boring Stuff.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.160
And Trey Hunter has given a bunch of PyCon talks.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.360
So it was just kind of interesting being in that group.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.360
And, you know, some people asking questions like, oh, well, what do you think about this?

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:14.440
And, you know, it's just kind of interesting in terms of being kind of included in that for now.

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:22.680
But, yeah, we bounce some ideas off each other in terms of, you know, a lot of people are saying that they were basically saying that they use email lists a lot.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:32.280
So that's one thing that I'm kind of lacking on is setting up a good emailing list, because that's something that you can kind of take anywhere when you know anywhere that you go.

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:39.980
So if, you know, YouTube was to fall through and I have to move to a different platform, then that email list is still something that stays with you.

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.600
And you can always, you know, email out all of your followers and say, hey, I'm, you know, not doing this anymore.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.300
I'm going here.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.620
So you kind of have an audience that can follow you around.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:56.520
So, yeah, bouncing ideas like that off of each other was a great way to to learn different techniques and different streaming services and how other people are doing things.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.420
So, yeah, I thought it was extremely useful.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:50:59.020
That's really cool.

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.620
I definitely want to double down on that.

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:09.820
Like, I think the sort of the email list side of things and that kind of stuff is very much the iceberg of success for a lot of these things.

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:15.260
And, you know, the stuff that you don't actually see, the people are like, that person is crazy successful about it.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.220
But you don't actually see how it is.

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.880
There probably is some sort of email list involved.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:23.700
Like I have, you know, some for the podcast and some for the training.

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.800
And it's the relative value.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:32.200
I would say, like, I would trade 20,000 Twitter followers for 2,000 email people who actually want to be there.

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.980
Like it's at least that that much of a difference.

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:39.600
Yeah, because that's people who have gone out of their way to actually, you know, taking the time to subscribe.

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.300
It's so much easier to just get on Twitter and hit follow.

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:46.580
But, yeah, there's so many of those people who won't get the message that you're trying to send through.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:54.600
So, yeah, having a core audience of people who, you know, really listen to the things that you send out is definitely, definitely useful to have.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:58.340
Yeah, I just want to say thanks to everybody who subscribed to my list or subscribed to the podcast.

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:01.580
And I know you feel the same way about your YouTube subscribers, right?

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:07.060
Yeah, that's definitely the only reason that we can do it full time for sure.

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:07.780
Yeah, for sure.

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:13.220
So, YouTube can be a tough place to sort of put yourself out there.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:17.000
Where, you know, it's like 99% of the people are really friendly and super supportive.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:24.960
And then other people, you know, they'll think that you owe them some sort of consulting thing because you talked about something they're having a problem with.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.540
Or they can just be like outright mean.

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.700
Like, have you had any of those experiences?

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:32.700
I know that I have and other people who are doing similar stuff have.

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:39.600
Yeah, so like you said, it's probably a little over more than 99% who are completely positive.

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:45.500
And then you're going to have that, you know, that less than 1% who definitely kind of give you a hard time.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.960
And yeah, I've run into that.

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:53.240
It's one thing that you kind of have to – I actually thought it was going to be worse before I started doing it.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:58.800
So it was – because, you know, I look at, you know, news channels on YouTube and stuff like that.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:03.460
If you look in the comment section of channels like that, it's just a complete, you know, dumpster fire.

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:04.180
It's terrible.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.800
But in this community, it's been fantastic.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:12.980
You know, a lot of people are supportive, you know, and other creators even support other creators.

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:16.920
So it's not like we look at each other as, you know, competitors.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:23.100
I've had – you know, I've recommended other people's YouTube channels whenever I don't really haven't covered a subject yet.

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:24.340
And they've done the same.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:28.220
I've seen, you know, people who have YouTube channels who link to my videos.

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:31.340
And yeah, so it's for the most part very supportive.

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.520
But yeah, that's just like anything on social media these days.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:42.720
You kind of have to have slightly thick of a skin to ignore that 1% because those are definitely the ones that kind of stick with you and sting for a while.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.720
But –

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:44.140
Exactly.

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:48.960
You could have 100 great comments and then one super mean one.

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.320
And somehow that is the takeaway that you take from those messages.

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:58.880
But I find that I've gotten to the point where, you know, I have definitely not thick skin in general as a person.

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:03.240
But over the last few years, I definitely have built it up and it's fine.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:07.680
But I just wanted to kind of touch on that a little bit for anyone else who's out there thinking about it.

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.480
Just let it roll off.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.440
It's not the – you're helping most of the people.

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.180
There's a few people that get upset and whatever.

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.100
Yeah, exactly.

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.060
And that's – these days I don't even take it personally.

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:21.140
I think those people would be upset at no matter what the content is.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:26.100
I think some people are just looking for an outlet and they kind of forget that there's another person on the other side of the computer.

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:32.120
And so they kind of use it as their own, you know, little punching bag to get on there and say whatever they want to say.

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:34.940
So – but yeah, it used to bother me more than it did.

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.840
But after doing it for a while, you just got to, yeah, let it roll off.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.720
Yeah, I'll give you one real quick example just so people kind of get a sense.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.320
You know, I have two MongoDB courses.

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.780
One of them is eight hours.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.300
And we talked about how much work that is.

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.660
One of them is two and a half hours and it's not like a copy of the other course.

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.860
It's totally different.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.560
And I did that from scratch.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:57.600
And it took me almost a month of just work to make that free course that I gave away, you know.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.360
And one of the first comments was, why won't you just give us the full course?

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:02.040
This is crap.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.000
I'm just like, are you kidding?

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:09.120
I spent a full month of my life making zero income to make this for people like you.

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.060
You don't have to love it.

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.380
But please, you know, come on.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.340
Don't like go out and publicly berate it.

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:14.860
Right?

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:17.280
But that kind of stuff, you know, hundreds of people loved it.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.300
Thousands of people loved it.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.760
But that one person still kind of bugs me.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.360
So you just got to get like to the point where like, yeah, that does bug me.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:24.640
Yes.

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.380
Stuff like that.

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:30.540
There's, you know, there's a lot of stuff out there that's, yeah, just not really offered as constructive criticism.

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.020
I mean, I get a lot of constructive criticism and I kind of like that.

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:39.220
I like whenever people are nice and they say, hey, you know, I, you know, why don't you, I couldn't really watch this.

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:44.620
You know, on some of my older videos, they were like, you know, this looks great, but I wish you would have made the text larger because I can't see.

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:47.440
So now stuff like that really helps because I can make better stuff.

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:50.780
But yeah, there's a lot out there that's not even really meant to be constructive.

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:56.860
I think the other day I had, let's see, one of them that kind of stuck with me is one of the earlier videos I did.

00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.620
Somebody was like, man, this guy's Southern accent is so bad.

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.400
Why would anybody watch this, you know, watch this all the way through?

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.900
And so I was kind of thinking about that, like, man, maybe everybody's going to think that.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.480
But no, it's 99.9% positive.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.160
So, yeah.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:10.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:11.420
Absolutely.

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:11.900
Absolutely.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.120
All right.

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:19.000
So I guess, you know, I don't have enough experience with this side of things, but, you know, maybe people out there might be interested.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.080
So share as much or as little about this as you want to tell me, like, I don't want to answer this.

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:28.800
But you talked about in the first couple of years, you only made like $100 a month or something like that.

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.080
And then it became enough that it could be your job.

00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:40.520
Like, what level of subscribers and views and, like, how frequently do you have to put stuff out where it's like, okay, I could reasonably call this my job if I did that?

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:46.300
So what's the bar for people to aim for if they wanted to do something like that, I guess is what I'm asking.

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:52.140
That is a tough question to answer because it's so – it's very – it's different for every person.

00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:59.900
So, like, for me personally, I was able to – I think I quit my job as soon as I reached 100,000 subscribers.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:08.800
But sometimes people will have more subscribers with less views, and sometimes they'll have more views with less subscribers.

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:13.480
So it's kind of hard to – kind of hard to say exactly, you know, the number of subscribers there.

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:25.260
But one thing I will say is as I was going through the process, let's see, I think I was – I probably was able to quit whenever I was getting about 600,000 views per month.

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:28.580
And that's – and YouTube has all those analytics for people.

00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:42.060
YouTube's great with analytics in terms of, you know, telling you your demographic and when people stop watching your videos and how many people are watching your videos and where they're being found from, whether they're being found in search results or external URLs.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.820
So, yeah, that's about the time I could quit my job.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:51.460
And I'm actually trying to move over to different sources of income as well.

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:55.000
So I'd say right now – and I just made a video about this the other day.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.540
But I think right now I'm making about 95 percent of my income from YouTube advertisements.

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:06.940
So when people go to watch a video, YouTube plays an ad before the video, and then the creator gets a chunk of that money.

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:13.520
But really I would like to build up the fan funding section to where it makes up the majority of my income.

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.060
You know, sites like Patreon.

00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:17.680
I know that you have a Patreon for Talk Python.

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.060
Yeah.

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.660
And that's – I've never experimented with Kickstarter.

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:31.420
I know you've done some Kickstarter things that – so basically for people who don't know the difference between Patreon and Kickstarter is that Kickstarter is really meant to fund like one single project.

00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:33.980
And you have, you know, a goal that you're trying to reach.

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:39.680
And Patreon is more monthly contributions to an ongoing project.

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:46.120
So, you know, for people who are making consistent content like Talk Python, people can just support that on a monthly basis.

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:53.200
So I would really like to build up the fan funding section of the income more so that I wouldn't have to rely as much on YouTube.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:59:01.500
Because like I was saying before, in terms of having an email list where people can follow you to any platform, that's kind of the same concept with fan funding.

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:15.560
Like if I was to go from, you know, YouTube to something like Twitch and start doing more live streams through something like Twitch, then I wouldn't have to worry that I was losing that YouTube income if I had the majority coming from fan funding.

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:26.540
So then you can just be – you know, those are the only people that you, you know, are really looking out for are the people who are actually paying for your content and worrying less about advertisers and sponsors and stuff like that.

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.900
Yeah, that's really interesting.

00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:30.880
I think it's a good path for where you are and where you're going.

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:34.300
And it seems like a great way to connect with people.

00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:42.740
I don't push my Patreon stuff that much because if somebody supports the podcast by donating $1 a week, that's about $50.

00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:47.600
Or if they could buy one class a year, that's also about $50.

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.200
And if they buy the class, then they get something extra.

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:54.320
Whereas the Patreon, they kind of – I don't really have any perks there.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.240
So I don't push that super hard.

00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:05.680
But the multiple angles of staying in touch, the multiple ways that you can interact with people and help them and they can give back definitely is worth pursuing.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.400
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:06.900
All right.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.000
Well, Corey, this has been super interesting.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.100
And I think we're just about out of time here.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.120
So let me ask you the final two questions.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.020
So if you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.340
Although we could go to your YouTube channel and discover this probably.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.280
But go ahead and tell me that.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:26.900
That's probably the most common question that I get in my comment section is what editor I'm using in the videos.

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:31.240
So I'm using – I have a few videos where I set up different development environments.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.140
But the one that I'm actually using the most is Sublime Text.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:47.160
So – and that's – I didn't choose Sublime Text for any reason other than the fact that it is very minimalist and it doesn't have any bells and whistles getting in the way.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:55.920
And that makes it good for recording videos because then people can just focus on the actual code instead of seeing all these extra options off to the side.

01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:00.560
I think that PyCharm might have something like that in a presentation mode.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:08.880
But I – you know, Sublime Text is working for me so well right now that I haven't taken the time to check out other IDEs that might be useful.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.820
But I've heard great things about PyCharm too, though.

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:11.520
Yeah, very nice.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.400
Yeah, definitely Sublime Text is great.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.720
And then notable PyPI package.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:21.780
Yeah, I think the package I probably use most often is SQLAlchemy or SQLAlchemy.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:29.460
And that's basically just because, you know, it's hard to touch any application these days that doesn't have some kind of database in the back end.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:37.960
Even if that's, you know, a desktop application, you might be using SQLite on the file system or a web application you'll be doing, you know, maybe a Postgres in the background.

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:46.360
And, yeah, SQLAlchemy is great because it gives you this, you know, something that you can interact with and even switch databases around.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:51.080
You know, you can use SQLite for development and then go to Postgres for production.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.800
And all of that code just stays the same that you've written for SQLAlchemy.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.060
So that's definitely the one I think I use most often.

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.760
Yeah, that's a really nice one.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:07.540
And the ability to just change the connection string for production to development and maybe even have a totally different database, like you said, is really great.

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:07.780
Yeah.

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:10.160
So I've been recently been playing with Alembic.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:10.980
Have you been playing with that?

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:11.580
Alembic.

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.660
Is that, I don't think I have used that.

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:19.280
It comes from Mike Bayer as well, and it integrates with SQLAlchemy to do migrations.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:28.500
So as your class schema changes, you can just say apply these changes to upgrade my database in production or in staging as those changes roll in.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.080
It's really nice.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:29.340
Okay.

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:29.940
Yeah, that's right.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:31.880
I have actually used that on one project.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:35.400
And, yeah, that is a nice addition to SQLAlchemy as well.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.480
Yeah, I like those together.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.420
All right.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.400
So final call to action.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:44.640
I know lots of people out there are like, I would love to do something kind of like this.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.940
But what would you say to them?

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:49.560
Basically, I would just say to, you know, just to get started.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:56.560
If you want to do something like that, just start keeping notes about what you want to present to people, what you want to start creating.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.200
And then you can just slowly roll it out.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:07.120
You know, a lot of people feel like they have to have this big production setup before they even do their very first, you know, attempt at something like this.

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:17.640
But really, you can just, if you're doing a blog, you can just get on and write up your blog in a text editor and put it out to a site like GitHub Pages or something like that.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:23.180
Or if you're making videos, as long as you have, you know, you can buy a cheap microphone for about $20.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:26.000
The first videos I did, I didn't even have a microphone.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.400
So it was just, you know, recorded off my computer.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.020
And people don't mind that stuff as much as you think they would.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:37.640
So, yeah, just getting started and getting your foot in the door with stuff like that is the best way to go.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.480
Yeah, that's awesome.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.520
I started the podcast with a $55 microphone and $5 worth of software.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.880
So, yeah, yeah.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.420
Yeah.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.780
So it's not as complicated as what a lot of people make it out to be.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:53.440
It's just getting that first step, taking that first step and just doing it.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:04:01.140
I have one other thing to throw out there for people to sort of follow on with that is we live in a world where there are no longer gatekeepers.

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:01.680
Right.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.160
Like, who did you ask permission to start your YouTube channel from?

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.120
Oh, yeah, exactly.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:05.720
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.760
There's nobody.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.920
Nobody, right?

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.860
Nobody that you have to check with.

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:09.080
Yeah.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:09.400
Yeah.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.040
Same here.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.460
And so many of the people who are doing stuff like us, they just decided, I'm just going to do this.

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:22.040
And a lot of people sort of see, you know, I kind of think it's sort of under an undertone in their thinking, not super obvious.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:33.860
But they feel like I've got to get to some stage where people will accept me and where people are going to kind of like, I'm good enough that some channel or some platform will accept me to do my work.

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.660
Not really.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:35.800
You just got to go out there and get started.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.940
And, you know, there's no gatekeepers.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:38.560
It's up to you.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.380
Go and do it.

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.480
Yeah, I think that's great advice.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:40.800
Yeah.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.460
All right, Corey, thanks for being on the show.

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.820
This is really awesome.

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:46.780
And super congratulations on going full time on this.

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.260
That's amazing.

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.000
Yeah, thanks a lot.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.320
I really appreciate you having me on.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:54.880
I have listened to your podcast since probably the first episode and I never thought I would actually be on it.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.040
So it's really cool to be on here.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.020
That's really awesome.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.020
Well, I'm happy to have you.

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.360
This is cool stuff you're doing.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.860
So happy to share it.

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:02.580
Take care.

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:03.040
All right.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:03.360
Take care.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:03.820
Thanks a lot.

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:08.280
This has been another episode of Talk Python To Me.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.500
Our guest this week was Corey Schaefer.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.580
And this episode has been brought to you by Datadog and Rollbar.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:17.940
Datadog gives you visibility into the whole system running your code.

Thanks so much for listening.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.660
I really appreciate it.

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.600
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:39.120
I'll see you next time.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:07:09.100
Thank you.
