00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.800
Network engineering is quickly moving towards a world where it's as much programming and automation

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.760
as it is packets and ports. Join Hank Preston and me to discuss what parts of Python are

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.760
important for network engineers to learn. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 175, recorded August 8th, 2018.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:36.780

Hank, welcome to Talk Python. Thanks, Michael. Thanks for having me. Yeah, it's great to have you here.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:10.600
We're going to delve into a topic that I think is really interesting, and I think it highlights one of the reasons of this explosive growth in Python.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:21.300
We've had people writing web apps in Python for a long time, but now Python is starting to appear in these other domains where programming wasn't necessarily the first thing that people did.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.780
And we're going to talk about programming for network engineers.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.220
Excellent. It's a topic close to my heart because that's what I talk about most days these days.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.580
Yeah, that's awesome. So before we get to that, let's focus on your story and just talk about how you got into programming in Python.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.060
Where did it all start?

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:44.360
Yeah, so it's good. So my story and my rapid love affair with Python started, I would say, I think it was about five years ago.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.900
And I was working at Cisco, which is where I currently am now, as a systems engineer and solutions architect focusing on data center topics.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.540
And around that same time, the cloud kind of tidal wave was hitting everybody.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.940
And so part of our role...

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.380
What year was that?

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.540
Yeah, I'd have to go back and look.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.640
I mean, somewhere in the 2012, 2013 area is where it kind of...

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.260
It'd been there for a while, but that's where it started to affect my day-to-day job.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.580
Right. It kind of left the, hey, all the startups are doing it.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.820
But the Fortune 500, they're going to never touch the cloud ever, ever, right?

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.560
Until they did.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.700
Yeah, no. And that's really what it was going through.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.500
At that point, the customers I was dealing with mostly were like the Fortune 500s, enterprise customers in the Midwest.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.860
And we were starting to hear from the likes of these large kind of Fortune 500 and Fortune 100 customers that they're starting to experiment.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.900
Or they've realized that they had been experimenting in the cloud for a long time.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.600
It's just nobody told them that they had stuff that was out there, which was always fun.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.780
So as this was going through, I had one of my managers came up and said, hey, we need to start understanding what this whole cloud thing is.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:02.360
We need to understand what application development is, what a cloud app is, and why it's so different, and how to talk to folks that are in here.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.340
And I had the opportunity to kind of go off and spend some time on a program that Cisco put together around cloud native development.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.480
And so it was kind of a boot camp approach to diving into a bunch of different topics.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.480
And it was from containers to cloud applications.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.060
And part of that program was actually two weeks of Python training.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.320
I credit Raymond Hedinger with giving me an awesome kind of exposure to Python, diving me in really well.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.600
His intensive introduction to Python class is the most aptly named technical class I've ever had.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.700
That's cool.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.880
Was this an in-person class?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.260
Did he come out to your equation?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.800
He did.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.400
So he actually, I don't know if he's still doing it today because I haven't looked in a while.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.780
But at that point, he was teaching Python every week for Cisco classes.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.080
And so he would teach a class in San Jose, and then he'd go down to Austin, and then he'd go to RTP.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:03.760
And he would just be teaching our developers inside of our business units, inside of our services organization, Python fundamental skills, because it was becoming so important to everything that was there.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.480
And so this was a class focused on our field engineers to go through and start to help us get prepped into it.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.420
And he actually had, his classes still exist.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.380
And I still see them go through the pieces occasionally.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.640
But it's like an intro, and then it was an intermediate, and then an advanced.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.900
And I swear, across those three weeks of training classes, it was like a year of intense college study to go through.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.100
Just the level of kind of depth that he took us and how quick we went in.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.980
That's really interesting.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:40.660
I feel like colleges, for some reason, when they teach programming, it goes incredibly slow compared to how fast you can actually learn it if you just put your head down, right?

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.080
Absolutely.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.540
And that was the piece.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:52.640
And normally, many of us have been used to go into these training classes where you can go in and you can step out for a phone call, or you can go take a meeting halfway through, and you really don't miss anything.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.180
In this case, it was a very kind of, if you stepped out, you were like lost.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.100
It was like you lost a week of a college class.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.440
And so that's where I dove into Python.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.340
And I mean, within just a couple of days, I realized that programming was different from when I did it originally.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.340
Because I had a background in some development.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.400
I had done some Java and C++ and a bit of .NET development, some database work.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:24.080
And then I made a conscious decision to kind of go over and move more into the infrastructure space and focus on kind of systems and then eventually networking as kind of a specific domain.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.720
Frankly, because I wasn't a big fan of Java.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.120
And I got tired of developing in Java.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.260
So I gave up on that.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.940
But when I had this exposure to Python, it was such an easy language to get into.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.980
The syntax was really kind of readable.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.060
I didn't need to be a software developer.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.940
I could kind of dabble with it for a little bit and then come back.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.540
And I didn't feel like I lost anything.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.220
I could consume other people's code really easy.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:57.080
And it's a lot of those characteristics about Python, which is what's made it so successful in the network engineering, as well as kind of general infrastructure engineering space as kind of a language of choice.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.840
I think that's a really interesting point.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.960
And there have been a lot of languages that are easy to read, like VB is a language you could read pretty easy, right?

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.420
Visual Basic.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.800
But a lot of the ones that are easy to start with have these pretty low ceilings.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.000
It's like, well, you can build up to this point, but you want to build something real.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.380
You put that away and you get out the Java, you get out the C++.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.200
And Python doesn't have really that ceiling quite nearly as low.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.540
And I think that's partly one of the things that makes it really special.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.920
Yeah.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.140
And that's been one of the huge elements for me.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.560
I mean, I've been doing Python daily for several years now going through.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.820
And I still go back to some of the fundamental skills that I learned in those early classes.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.340
But the programs I'm building are much more sophisticated than some of the early ones that go through.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:46.140
And when I look at some of the new features that come into the language, they're really exciting things that are coming after it.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.320
But they're being put in a way that you don't have to use those, right?

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.440
It still gives you this ability to kind of work your way into Python, absorb the capabilities when it makes sense for you.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.360
And there's a challenge there.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.860
It's not like with JavaScript.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:05.720
It feels like you have to like immediately you're embedded inside of all sorts of promise statements and multiple levels of like embedded.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.440
And you can't do anything.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.640
With Python, you can start really simple.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:17.620
And then when the time calls for it, there's all of this other stuff that you can pull out and become very sophisticated as far as the language goes.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.940
Yeah.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.120
That's part of its sort of elasticity up and down the experience scale, right?

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.520
You don't have, like you said, you don't have to be an expert in all of Python to build interesting things.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.080
Like you maybe don't even know what a function is, but you could still do some pretty interesting stuff in straight down.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.820
You know, you don't need to care about code reused or whatever, right?

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.100
Yep.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.780
It's object oriented under the hood, but you can completely ignore objects.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.140
Until you realize that there's value in it.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.500
And hell, half my code still ignores objects, it seems like these days.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.060
Yeah, that's quite an interesting point.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.020
So speaking about these days, what are you doing day to day?

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.280
You're a developer evangelist at Cisco, is that right?

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:52.660
Correct.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.360
Dev evangelist.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:53.760
Yep.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.120
Yep.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.160
So I'm a network programmability evangelist with Cisco inside of our DevNet organization.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.060
So DevNet's the developer enablement program for Cisco.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:10.700
And so it's where people that are looking for our API documentation and SDKs and sample code and sandboxes and resources.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.820
That's all of that's available up on DevNet.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:18.180
And my team of evangelists are like you would find in any of the developer enablement programs.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:23.220
As we go out and we help people better make use of and understand what's possible with the tools.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.540
Cisco has a huge portfolio of products from networking to security and collaboration.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:34.300
I focus really, really fully in the network automation, network programmability space.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:48.440
And so there's tons to keep us busy and there's tons of work out there helping all of these enterprises and the network engineers inside of the enterprises figure out what automation means and how they can start to automate their deployments.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.880
And what does it take to skill up and make changes?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:57.300
And these are the types of things, resources we build, as well as kind of events that we hold and discussions we give.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:13.280
So you might be going out and visiting like a group of network engineers who maybe haven't done a lot of programmability automation of networks and you help sort of bring them along or maybe help them design how that applies to their infrastructure or something like that.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:13.860
Exactly.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:22.360
Yeah, there's there's I usually I frame it in two two cases where it goes through most days these days organizations are recognizing they need network automation.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.480
And so they're going to their networking teams and saying, OK, we need to figure this out.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.760
What resources are available?

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:35.780
And so I can I go into some of those organizations and I'll spend a couple of days helping them and kind of leading introduction to programmability classes.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.600
And so just last week, I actually spent an entire day with one of my customers.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.200
We had about 20 engineers in the room and we were going through basics of Python.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.900
And so what is a Python script?

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.280
How do you create variables?

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.140
What are libraries and what libraries are interesting for the network engineer?

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.980
How do you parse data that comes back?

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.660
Because that's a big part of dealing with clear text versus JSON and all these other.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.660
Yeah.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.480
What is JSON?

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.440
How do you process it?

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.000
What is XML and what's a YAML file?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.540
All of that goes through.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:15.620
And that's a big part of this bringing Python into the network engineering field is network engineers have been in IT for years and many of them took comp sci classes way back when.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.820
And they may have done similar cases like I did.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.460
Didn't like Java a whole lot.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.400
And so went into networking.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.780
Program is not fun.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.180
I'm out of here.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:22.460
Yeah.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:22.820
Yeah.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.540
Enough of that.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.220
I'm going to go make packets go across the network.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.840
So what we're doing now is trying to help remind them kind of some of these skills that are there.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.480
They start to like knock the cobwebs off some of the fundamental programming stuff they had for maybe 20, 30 years ago when they went to school.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.420
And then start to add these new elements that are there.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.340
XML didn't exist for some of these guys when they went through it.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.900
And YAML certainly didn't.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.600
And so showing them the value.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:51.620
And so showing them the value, showing them how to use it, how to connect to a device through Python using one of these APIs that are available.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.180
And why is that better than doing it the way that they're doing it today?

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:01.300
Because that's a big part of the discussion often is showing them that there is value in making this journey.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.980
Right. Because a lot of them probably didn't decide to be programmers.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:10.080
I mean, maybe that's a good way to segue into like what is the background of a typical network engineer?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:17.720
Like you said, maybe they have some programming experience, some technical experience, but they probably didn't choose networking because they wanted to be a programmer.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.280
So what's the story there?

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.200
What do you experience?

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.020
Yeah, they absolutely didn't choose networking because they wanted to be a programmer.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:36.240
In fact, one of the things I hear an awful lot when we start to have these discussions is in some cases they're coming kicking and screaming because they really don't want to be a programmer and they don't want to learn these new skills.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:48.460
And it's helping them recognize that just because you're going to do some automation, you're going to learn some Python, doesn't mean that you're now a software developer because these skills are becoming relevant to data scientists, to engineers, to everybody.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.160
And so there's this blurring and the gap.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:58.320
A typical network engineer has a foundation in kind of network theory and connectivity areas that are there.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.780
So there's the typical kind of OSA model of layer one, two, three, all the way up to seven.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.040
So they understand the fundamentals of how network traffic works.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:15.500
They spend their days dealing with networking concepts like IP space and ports and firewalls and load balancers.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:22.800
So all of these elements, these foundational elements that help make applications function that the cloud relies on to go through.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.840
The network engineer is coming in these discussions with this understanding of how kind of this foundation goes through.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:37.400
And despite the fact that in many cases they don't think that they've done a lot of automation or they've done a lot of programming or scripting in their previous life, let's say,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:45.500
many of them have because every network engineer I've ever known has been a problem solver and is always looking for ways to do things a little bit better.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:51.180
And so for the longest time, and in some cases still today, it's a CLI interface.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.540
A command line interface is how we configure a network.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:59.340
Maybe a bash script or something like that that'll like process, you know, like automate that in that sense, right?

00:12:59.340 --> 00:12:59.860
Exactly.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.820
There's there's expect scripting, right?

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:07.240
So send this and expect to get this back and then send this other one away because there's network.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.120
Every network engineer I've known really hates having to repeat themselves over and over again.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.740
And so they've figured out ways to make their jobs better.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:26.200
And so that's the big thing I'm trying to show them is this move into using Python is actually going to make what they've done in the past simpler and actually a little bit more pleasurable because we can take away some of the challenges that were there.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.880
There is a bit of that, I don't want to say hurdle, but like a plateau to get people over.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.800
And that first aha moment, that's one of my favorite things to see when I'm working with somebody is when they get it.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.100
They understand the value.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.240
They understand that it's not this thing to be dreaded.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:39.480
Right.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.440
They're like, I don't want to do this.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.280
This is not my job.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.320
This is not what I signed up for.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:42.760
Wait a minute.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.520
That's pretty awesome.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:43.800
Yeah.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.200
Okay.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:44.860
Maybe it's worth it.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.540
Something like that, right?

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.080
Exactly.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.740
Exactly.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:54.680
So you talked about getting into Python almost because of the cloud and things like that.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:05.500
It seems to me the cloud movement itself has probably dramatically changed what it means to be a network engineer in the first place, right?

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.420
Like there used to be these physical things.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.500
You could log into them and mess with them.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.820
And now it's APIs and VMs and data centers far away from you.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.060
Yeah.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.480
It's completely accurate.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:23.760
I mean, it comes back on network engineers ourselves to some extent that it seemed that we got so far away from what a network really was.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:32.380
And we started to see a network as these physical routers and switches and firewalls that we touched rather than the act of connecting together the pieces that are there.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.140
And so I talk a lot.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.420
One of the conversations I give is this evolution to networking in the programmable age.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.040
And I go back in time to when the network really was just routers and switches and servers.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.100
Yeah.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.220
You refer to that as the four ages of networking.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.300
Do you want to take us through it?

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.280
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:56.100
And so originally, right, in what I often call kind of like the stone age of networking, things were simple.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:02.500
We had servers and workstations and printers, and they connected into switches, and then maybe we had a router to communicate with them.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:13.340
And the biggest thing network engineers were focused on is kind of like making sure that spanning tree didn't cause issues in the network and that if they were going to have to use some VLANs to carve computers and printers off.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.520
Because at that point, the network was you could walk into any closet and you could reach out and touch it.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.340
It was usually like teal green and had Cisco written on it, and that was the network.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.660
And there were cables, and it was really easy.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:36.600
But over time, the first hint of the kind of the changes to networking that I started to see, and many of us did, was virtualization, x86 virtualization with VMware and these other things.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.580
And the concept of a V switch came out.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:50.580
And it wasn't even that long ago, I would have heated discussions with networking and server teams about whose responsibility it was for the network inside of a hypervisor.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:58.580
Because the network guys didn't want to do it because it wasn't a physical switch, and the server guys had no idea what a VLAN was or what a tag was.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.520
And so there was this huge challenge that went through.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:10.480
And sadly, in many of those cases, the networking guys just stuck their head in the sand and said, you know what, I'm just going to let the server guys deal with it because it doesn't really matter.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:20.460
And then as we moved from kind of that stone age, that early piece that went in into the dot-com era and all of these other pieces, new things went after us.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.300
After x86 virtualization, we got blade switches.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.560
And so we had these new physical pieces.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:33.680
But rather than buying a blade switch from a networking vendor, maybe it's being bought from a server company.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.420
And so networking guys were once again saying, you know what, that's not my stuff.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.520
I'm not going to deal with it.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.940
And then what was it, two years ago, we started to see kind of the container explosion.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:51.920
And so now we've got networking inside of Linux servers that are behind virtual switches that are running embedded inside of a blade server someplace.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:59.000
And the networking guys are finally realizing that there is a lot of networking that is happening outside of their physical switches.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.920
And that's been a big kind of aha moment.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.200
And then we can bring in the cloud elements.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:11.500
Because when we talk about the cloud, if we're talking public cloud, in these cases, now we're sending workloads and resources up there.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:17.260
And we don't even have the luxury as a network engineer to know that at some point that traffic will go through my physical switch.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.640
Because you don't own those physical switches.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:25.600
Yeah, the one final bastion of thing they claimed is theirs has now been virtualized and moved out.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.760
And so now it's all the other stuff.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.140
They're like, well, that's not really my problem.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.980
Like, that's like what's left that they now need to work with, right?

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.200
Exactly, exactly.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:50.900
And so as the evolution from virtualization to containers to cloud, and I love the fact that cloud is now starting to turn into this, rather than people thinking of the cloud as a place, like AWS is the cloud or Google or Azure or one of these other cloud providers.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:56.380
This idea of cloud is just kind of an approach, a fully programmable approach to infrastructure.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:01.800
And so I've got customers today that consider their data centers their cloud on that side as well.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.340
And they want to manage their clouds the same way that they consume and manage their other ones.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.340
This is with this huge pressure.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.280
Yeah, I think it is.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:19.140
And I think what's really interesting is, you know, there's this joke or, I don't know, sarcasm or whatever that says, you know, the cloud is really just somebody else's computer.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:19.440
Yeah.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.300
Right.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.820
Which I think that's a little bit disingenuous.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.640
Technically, it's true.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.560
Someone owns the computer.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:32.140
But I think fundamentally, the cloud is a programmable set of infrastructure that you don't have to go touch, right?

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.760
And that programmability could be within your data center.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.620
It could be AWS.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.360
It could be somewhere else like Linode or something, right?

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:46.900
It's the ability to write some code and servers and switches and networks come into existence, I think, in my mind, at least.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.220
Yeah, I think that's accurate.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:54.480
The idea that the cloud, you don't have to worry about the infrastructure is true if you're consuming cloud.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.260
But there's also this other group of engineers that are building clouds, right?

00:18:59.260 --> 00:18:59.760
Right.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.060
And somebody has to do that.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:12.240
And it's been interesting to watch the pendulum swing from 100% public cloud strategies to 100% hybrid cloud and then some people coming back to fully private cloud.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:23.580
If any part of an organization and enterprise strategy involves some element of private cloud, be that for data sovereignty or security or cost, because that does come up occasionally.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:32.400
Well, now the people that are writing and deploying apps want to consume the cloud inside of your data center the same way they did it in the public cloud.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:38.120
But now you have to have a team that can build the infrastructure that can offer that service.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.980
And that, I think, is the huge pressure.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:45.260
And that maybe means programming API, like creating APIs for them to consume and stuff like that, right?

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:45.940
Exactly.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:53.760
It hasn't come up a lot, but I've had two cases specifically with enterprises where they had taken on, they had done some automation of their own.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.640
They were doing a lot of work in the networking space.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:06.040
But they were starting to get requests from application teams and systems and services teams to offer the network services through an API interface.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:17.140
And so they were starting to build an API that their application teams could consume and their operations teams could consume to make general connectivity or logging requests or information.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:23.240
And so we got to actually, it was a really fun project we did because we got to show, okay, well, let's talk about API design.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.940
How do you build an API?

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:34.260
What makes an API good so that your developers who are used to consuming APIs from Google and Azure and all these other folks will be happy about consuming your API?

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:48.520
All of a sudden you're put into the place where like you have to compete on API design with Google and Amazon, which, you know, just a while ago, maybe you were even really interested in writing APIs and you're kind of in the deep end at that point, right?

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.120
Exactly.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.440
And those are the interesting pieces that are coming at it.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.840
And organizations are getting these changes and these adjustments so fast these days.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:02.020
And I think that's a big challenge that every industry has, but certainly the network engineers have.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.340
It's trying to figure out how do they keep up?

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:09.340
How do they, it's, there's always that analogy of you're laying the track as the train is kind of approaching.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.740
And I think that that's never going to change in the IT space.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:21.500
And that's been a big struggle because for better or worse, the networking industry didn't have a lot of adjustments for several years, let's say decades in some cases.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.480
And this adjustment to cloud and programmability and automation is this massive pivot.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.940
And so now we've got a lot of engineers and network engineers out there just trying to figure out how do I keep up, right?

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.760
What do I learn next?

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.060
Where do I go through on this area?

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.280
And that, that sense of overwhelming nature.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:42.260
And my, my advice to them is, okay, yes, there's a lot, but remember this is an exciting time, right?

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.560
We were talking about how bored we were two years ago.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.840
Now you've got cool stuff to work with.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.620
Let's look at the value of what all of this new stuff has for us.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.740

Just visit talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.840
Yeah, that's got to be interesting to be in that position.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:57.340
Because I feel like network engineers were fairly, they didn't feel the full pressure of all this stuff.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.460
Like the changes that we feel constantly in software development.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.160
Like, I mean, imagine you're a JavaScript developer.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.640
Like, you just learned one front-end framework.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.080
And it's like now ridiculous to use it.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.900
There's a new one, right?

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.000
Yeah.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.160
That's like three weeks together.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.840
It's just constantly like that.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.300
Python's a little less bad.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:18.780
But this does sort of hit them, not out of the blue, but I think it's kind of a wave, a tidal wave type thing.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.880
I think also like sysadmins probably had a similar experience as well.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:32.320
I've seen it in the same, I mean, the installation, I think the farther you get from the end product, and the end product for most of these cases is some piece of software someplace.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:38.860
And so the farther you are from the end product, the longer it took for some of this pressure to kind of go through.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:45.740
Because software developers solved a lot of the things on their own, and then eventually it kind of overflowed into the systems teams.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.920
And so now the server teams had to figure out how to deal with the capacity and the agility.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.120
And then eventually that overwhelmed them to storage.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.100
And we're getting it into security now, security and networking now.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:03.500
And that's where this insulation is breaking down, because it was this like tidal wave that was just pushing and pushing and pushing.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.500
And eventually it just kind of knocked the wall over.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:13.960
And all this demand is coming at network engineers to be agile, to be secure, to offer segmentation, to be able to implement.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:19.680
We're getting requests for machine learning and artificial intelligence inside of the network now to make network decisions.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.480
And I'm still teaching Python 101 to folks.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.460
And they're also asking, well, where does blockchain fit in?

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.260
It's all of these topics that are coming in at the same time, which is good and bad.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.600
Certainly keeps the job interesting.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.480
Yeah, you've got to have the right mindset.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.140
But it definitely sounds like a fun and exciting time.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:43.520
So that's some of the ways that automation and Python have sort of changed the role for network engineers.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.420
What else is changing for them?

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.180
What else is Python sort of changing that I don't even know to ask about?

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.720
Yeah, I mean, I think that's the interesting one that goes through.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:58.640
One of the impacts of using Python to automate your network is kind of all of the things that come along with that.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.200
Because now they are writing some code someplace.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.480
And so there's all these new strategies around kind of where do we put code?

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.320
And so at the same time we're teaching Python, we're teaching source control strategies.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:09.940
Of course.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:20.100
We're showing folks how to deal with branches and how to use issue logs and pull requests to go through, which then gets to take us down kind of a pipeline path and go in.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:33.140
One of the interesting pieces that often comes quickly is how fast an engineer goes from thinking Python is going to be their answer and then reaching out to some other management tool like Ansible, which is written in Python.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.100
But they say, you know, I don't have to learn Python.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.080
I can just go learn Ansible and fix all these issues and I'll just go down that path.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:49.600
And that goes for a little while and then all of the challenges that potentially come out of that come through and then eventually they're back to, okay, maybe I do really need to understand the Python under the hood.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.320
I can't just kind of absorb some new open source tool to make everything better.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.240
Yeah, for sure.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.000
Of course, that whole software carpentry side of things has got to come in, right?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Like as soon as you start to depend upon Python scripts to do your job, it's like, well, we should actually version control this and how do we share this together and how do we test it?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.820
And just, you know, all those layers just start to come crashing in.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:11.820
It's pretty interesting.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.240
I had a question came in to me over LinkedIn.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.400
It was two days ago and it was from a network engineer who I've been talking with for a while.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:26.160
And he's like, all right, here's the challenge we have is I've got people across my organization writing automation scripts to do really interesting things.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:34.460
And we've made a lot of progress, but now we've got islands of automation and everybody's automation looks different and nobody can use everybody else's automation.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.640
So how do we, how do we bring these things together?

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.740
And so we started to talk about things like coding style guides, right?

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:47.800
You have to come up with some, some approach and styles, not syntax, which means there's no right or wrong way.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.280
It's, it's kind of a consensus.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.300
Somebody has to say, this is how we do things.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:27:02.300
And then kind of making sure that people aren't porting their code and their scripts kind of on their machine and start to collaborate through repositories and go down that path.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.960
And, and that's an interesting piece that goes in.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:13.680
Moving network engineers away from the days where they, they would store their information in text files that were their version control was .v1, .v2, .v3.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.980
You really got to save it and zip it up.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:16.360
Yeah.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:16.900
Yeah.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:17.000
Yeah.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.220
And then teaching them just the magic that's offered and available inside using some sort of source control and version control system goes through.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:36.900
We spend probably just as much time trying to teach fundamentals of source control as fundamentals of Python and some of these early workshops, because that's what it takes to be successful in these areas.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:50.840
And having, having, having approached this myself and kind of stumbled my way through it, there's, there's things that I wish I would have started doing sooner that I'm trying to help network engineers today kind of learn from the mistakes that I made rather than having to go make the mistakes themselves.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.220
Yeah.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.240
Coming through this path, it sounds like many of them do.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:04.760
I'm sure they go through the experience of creating what you would think of as a script that does a very specific thing that you can run to.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.840
Well, there's actually this algorithm in here and these are the inputs of the algorithm.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.940
How do I turn this actually into say a library or a project someone else could consume?

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.300
And how do we start to build these building blocks?

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.260
I think that's probably an interesting transition as well.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:19.600
Yeah.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.540
It's interesting to go through.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:33.880
I mean, one of the, one of the strategies we use to try to break down the learning of automation and the value, the value prop that's there is, is we sit down and we say, okay, well, what are, what are like the five things that you spend almost every day doing?

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.640
Or maybe we take a trouble ticket.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.580
What every trouble ticket comes through.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:43.920
Every organization usually has like, these are the information you need to gather before you ever start working on a trouble ticket.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.300
Well, let's, let's figure out how we can automate that.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.380
And then we break those up into these little pockets.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:56.840
And so maybe we've got a team of a dozen engineers and three of them work on step one, three of them work on step two, the rest of them that go through.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:05.600
And then the goal is by, is to show them how they can then consume everybody else's work and say, okay, well, we can pull in this other person's piece of code.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.860
And so you don't have to do that.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:13.980
And so you don't have to redo that yourself as long as you're kind of abiding by these kind of ideas of how these libraries work or inputs and outputs that go through it.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.020
You don't care.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.480
Like, it doesn't matter what happened inside of their function.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.860
You just know what you need to send it and what to expect to come back.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.660
And if we all agree on that, well, you saved yourself two hours worth of work.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.180
Every day.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:25.620
Yeah.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.400
Or something like that, right?

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:26.780
Absolutely.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.920
Yeah.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.720
That's pretty awesome.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:36.480
So maybe now's a good time to talk about some of the major packages that people might use for in this programmability space.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:45.160
So, of course, probably a lot of these devices have direct APIs and you could, you know, create a JSON request and like send a post or something over.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.240
But it's probably better to use some higher level library, right?

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:48.680
Yeah.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.340
So there's a bunch of them that go through.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.240
And so we've mentioned Ansible already.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.440
Ansible is written in Python.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.120
Most people just use it as a program rather than as a library.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:03.140
But we do have some folks writing Ansible modules to extend out the capabilities that are there.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:03.420
Right.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.740
Most of the time, programming Ansible is like constructing YAML files, right?

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.340
Exactly.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:13.700
And until the module you need isn't there or it's not working exactly right.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.760
And so those go through.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:22.040
But for folks building kind of the raw Python and they want to go down that path, I always start with the fundamental toolkits, right?

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.240
You mentioned the APIs.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:28.160
And so the key networking APIs today are basic REST fundamentals.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:34.420
And so REST APIs, we're going to consume them the same way that anybody else is using requests library is going to go through.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.700
So that's an early one we teach.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:43.660
Inside of the networking space, the long-lauded and also kind of disparaged API of SNMP still exists.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:49.620
And so occasionally we work with PI SNMP to work through and bring SNMP details in.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:31:06.060
But frankly, the newest interfaces, and these are new standards that were developed by the IETF for network programmability specifically, are netconf and restconf, which are model-driven programmability interfaces based on data models that are agreed upon and well understood.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.020
And then these interfaces return data either in XML and JSON.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.240
So now we're getting into kind of true programmability interfaces.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:20.700
And so the NC client library is what we use to communicate with netconf at their, with the netconf protocol.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:34.900
And then after we get kind of, let's say, the hammers, the screwdrivers, the nuts and bolts, kind of understanding those pieces, then we can step up to some of the libraries that have been developed to kind of consume those and offer an easier way to go through.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:41.520
And so in the netconf model-driven programmability space, there's actually an open source project called YDK.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:54.540
It's Yang Development Kit that was spearheaded, and most of the development actually comes out of Cisco, which aims to wrap up the data models in a Pythonic library so that you don't have to make native API calls.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.220
You can just work with them through a Pythonic library.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.920
Then there's the configuration management tooling that's out there.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:08.820
And so the good folks over at Spotify started out the Napalm project, which is all about multi-vendor kind of network configuration pushes.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:16.200
So that's a library that's often used by a lot of organizations trying to actually push out and maintain true configuration standards across.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:22.620
And then there's some newer ones that are popping up here and there, kind of as new challenges are being designed and extended out.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.120
Yeah, Napalm looks pretty interesting.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:28.000
I had David Barroso on episode 128 to talk about that.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:34.640
The idea is there that you have a unified API regardless of the underlying devices, right?

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.200
So it kind of handles the inconsistencies across the different providers and such, right?

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:44.500
Yeah, Napalm is one of a handful of libraries that aim to do that same thing.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:50.340
As many organizations and engineers have to deal with different network platforms from multiple vendors.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.600
Or even if you're just Cisco, we've got multiple platforms that are there.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:33:01.580
And so within Napalm, and then there's another tool called NetMiko that tries to kind of say, okay, let's have standard ways through Python to write the code.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:08.480
And then the libraries themselves understand the intricacies of interfacing with a specific platform or specific software version.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.800
And you can focus on kind of very consistent commands and capabilities.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.220
Yeah, I feel like the cloud is the new lock-in.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:23.880
If you're on AWS and you deeply use their APIs, it's extremely hard to move along, right?

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.840
And same thing for Azure, right?

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.380
They're all different APIs and they all have different capabilities.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.180
And I'm not thinking just VMs.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:34.760
I'm thinking like their cloud storage, their database offering, all these different things, right?

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:40.920
I think that's why we see Microsoft just go, yeah, we don't actually care if he's Windows or not or Office because we got something better.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.340
Thanks.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.920
Well, I think that's the piece that goes through.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.140
I mean, everybody's always, there's this, the nasty term of lock-in.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.720
Nobody wants to be locked in.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.440
And I think the dirty secret is you're always locked into something.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.480
You just have to pick where you want your flexibility to be, what you're willing to be locked into.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.860
And then know that you've made a commitment there.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:05.340
I had an interesting conversation with one of the, a director of cloud and one of the customers I was talking through.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:09.160
And he said, look, we made, and this was an organization that had been around for a hundred years.

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:16.120
We made the decision decades ago that we were going to go into the mainframe and we were locked into the mainframe and it served us well.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.920
And there were ups and downs, but, but that worked well for us.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:27.720
And at this point they were making the decision to lock themselves into a cloud provider because they knew if they jumped in and they took advantage of all of the,

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:37.780
the value added services that the cloud provider had, and they embedded those into their applications, they knew full well, there was no way that they were going to be able to move without some significant cost.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:43.680
It was like when the days when they had to transition from a mainframe or Itanium onto x86, right?

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.700
That was a big project.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.580
It was, it was a huge thing.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.740
There had to be some massive component event.

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.340
The cloud is doing the same thing.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:58.700
Organizations that want to take advantage and accelerate their development by taking advantage of all of the services that AWS or Google or Azure offer.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.560
They do that hopefully knowingly at the price and at the cost.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:08.400
And with luck, the person that made that decision for the organization kind of had the right to make that decision for the organization.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.040
Yeah, that's an interesting point.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:17.000
But I definitely do see that as like, if you're willing to commit, you get full advantage of it, but you are committed.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.340
Yeah.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:17.640
Yeah.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.020
You're there.

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:18.360
Yeah.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:23.040
But locking themselves into mainframes, that was a good idea for many years for a lot of these companies.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:23.620
Right.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:27.760
So it's just, that's a choice, but it is interesting, I think.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.600
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Brilliant.org.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:40.800
Many of you have come to software development and data science through paths that did not include a full-on computer science or mathematic degree.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.420
Yet, in our technical field, you may find you need to learn exactly these topics.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.080
You could go back to university.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:51.000
But then again, this is the 21st century and we do have the internet.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.700
Why not take some engaging online courses to quickly get just the skills that you need?

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.940
That's where Brilliant.org comes in.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.380
They believe that effective learning is active.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:05.100
So master the concepts you need by solving fun, challenging problems yourself.

That's talkpython.fm/brilliant.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:34.800
So I guess the reason I bring that up is like Napalm having the ability to have this unified API kind of lessons that lock in just a little bit.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.760
And I think that's something that a lot of customers and engineers are looking at network programmability to give them that feature set to go through.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:48.480
And so it used to be that you were locked into a networking platform because that's what you built your automation around.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.160
Or that's what you knew how to configure.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.380
That was the tooling that you had.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:56.080
So today, if you say, okay, my lock-in choice is we're going to use Napalm.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.420
We're going to use Ansible.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.840
We're going to use Puppet or Solved or Cisco's NSO platform.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.540
One of these tools, that's going to be our point of interaction.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.000
As long as you work with those, then we're happy with it.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.800
And so that's the thing we're starting to see is organizations say, this is our tooling choice.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.040
How do you fit into this tooling choice as it goes through?

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:23.300
Because they want the ability to kind of Lego block and swap in and out underneath the tooling choice because that's their entry point.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:23.940
That's really interesting.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.480
Another one that you brought out was Nornir.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.180
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that right.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.020
But that seems like a very Pythonic one.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.200
They're like, they're deeply embracing Python as the way.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.140
Do you want to talk about that a bit?

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:36.460
Yeah.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.540
So I'm not super familiar with it.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.700
I'm just starting to learn it myself.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.220
And it's a new one that came through.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:46.600
David from Napalm, as well as Kirk Byers, who did the NET NICO program and some other pieces,

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.240
have kind of joined forces to build up this new automation framework for Python.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:56.160
And it's very much designed to be a Pythonic mechanism to go.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:01.600
A lot of the stuff that it talks about is rather than working in some domain-specific language

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:07.140
where you're limited by what that domain-specific language is capable of, what you're able to describe.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:12.380
With Nornir, the idea is we want to give people the full power of Python, right?

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.160
Let's not rewrite programming.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.240
Let's not shackle what's possible.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.380
Let's say, here's how we'll go through.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.100
And Nornir is a library that goes in.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.700
And what's been interesting is we talked a little bit about the levels of abstraction

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.360
and consumption.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:30.460
As I looked at Nornir, under the hood, it's leveraging tools like Napalm to actually do

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.640
the interface configuration.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.640
And so it seems like we're getting these kind of rushing, nesting dolls of libraries.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.560
It's turtles all the way down.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:38.840
Yeah.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.380
You just pick up, okay, we're going to use this one.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.500
And then when you look under the hood and you do like a pip freeze, you realize all of

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.040
the other things under the hood it's using.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:52.620
And this new fancy library is actually not doing all that much on its own, not to limit

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.680
or minimize what these libraries do.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.220
But that's the idea.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.540
And I think one of the values that these offer is they're building on top of the foundation

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.480
that's already been laid.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.340
And so we see that inside of all of these tools that go through.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:10.080
What I think is really interesting about Nornir is the fact that they have fully embraced

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:10.540
Python.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.780
Because one of the comments we see kind of over and over, and you'll see the Twitter

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.720
debates on these one, is don't use Ansible as a programming language.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:20.860
And then people are like, why not?

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.840
I can program in it.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.580
It's not a big deal.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.280
It's like, but you can't really do it.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.040
And then there's the debates that go back and forth.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.920
And it seems like in the networking space, there is starting to see this push for some

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.580
of the early adopters, the folks that have kind of got tons of battle scars from trying

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.120
to do things in an interesting way, saying, you know what, we need to go back.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.780
We need to make sure that we've got more control over what's possible.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:48.780
Network engineers at our heart have always really enjoyed toying with nerd knobs, having

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.420
access to all the features, understanding what's going on.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:57.160
And I think we're starting to kind of get that maturity level across areas of the industry

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.000
to say, okay, we need to really, we need to dive into this a little bit hard, have a little

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.840
bit more control, have a little bit more flexibility with what's there.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.380
Because despite the fact that they don't want to be locked into a platform, they also want

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.400
to be able to do whatever they can with those platforms that they've chosen.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:16.500
And if you're limited by what you're allowed to do inside of your infrastructure, because

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:21.000
some automation tool doesn't support it, well, that's now we have to extend our

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.660
automation tool and make some other choice.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.060
Right.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:28.300
They highlight a lot of interesting, what they call benefits on the Nornio project, like

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.500
a domain-specific language.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.140
A DSL can get complex when you've got to do advanced stuff.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:37.320
So avoiding the complexity of code might not be avoided anyway, right?

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.060
Code is easier to debug.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.840
Like you can actually just set a breakpoint and debug it.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.680
You might write code anyway.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.880
You can leverage your IDE for linting.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:51.020
And I think the final one is like a pretty interesting that they list here.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:55.600
And it says a side benefit of using this is it'll also teach you Python, which you'll find

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.160
to be a lot more useful than just knowing like a DSL.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.060
So for example, like you might learn Nornio, but now you know Python.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.680
And if you need to get another job, it's not, well, I can program Ansible.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.140
I can actually program full stop, right?

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:08.800
Exactly.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.600
Exactly.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.240
And that's the piece that comes through.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.340
I'll have folks ask me, should I learn Python or should I learn Ansible to automate my network?

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.960
And my answer to most folks is you need to learn both, probably.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.720
Ansible is a great tool.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:25.120
It's super popular in the network automation space today for a variety of reasons.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.340
And I don't see that popularity going away.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:33.940
But one of the things that comes up time and time again is engineers and enterprises will

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:39.100
get to a point with a tool like Ansible and then figure out, okay, I can't go any farther.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:44.000
And it's one of the points that you call out is they need an advanced feature or they need

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.600
some piece of logic element or they need to do something.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.260
And they just can't do it with a tool like Ansible that's there.

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:56.540
And so now they're either writing their own Python code to consume it as Ansible or they

00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:01.480
revert back and they start doing something else with a tool like Napalm or Dornier as it goes in.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.300
And I think it's going to be this pendulum swing that goes back and forth.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:09.000
As we start a little bit with Python, we get frustrated because it seems like we're doing

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.760
a lot of stuff that should be easier.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.100
You move to a higher level tool.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.100
You get frustrated because now you're limited with what you can do.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.080
But now you've learned a little bit more and you go back and forth.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.480
I think every organization and every engineer will find this sweet spot of what to consume

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.420
and what to build yourself.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:24.760
Yeah.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.540
I don't think it's only going to get better, right?

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:30.100
Like there's only more stuff on PyPI that you can pip install.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.180
Absolutely.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.280
Absolutely.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:38.120
I think last time I looked, it was like 147,000, but I haven't been counting for a few weeks.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.560
So it's probably even higher.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.260
It's insane.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:40.740
It's great.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.360
It's getting to the point now where you've got to be careful.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:47.340
The number of times the pluralization of a package has thrown me off where I swear I installed

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:52.140
the package I wanted and then come to find out I, instead of installing requests, I installed

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:55.880
request, which is a completely different library and works completely differently.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.640
What do you mean this function's not here?

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.760
I know get is on request.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.200
No, that's plural.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:00.780
That's right.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:01.060
Yeah.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:01.380
Yeah.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.340
Those come up time and time again as it goes in.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.040
And I love the fact that anybody can build something and post it to PyPI.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.360
That's awesome.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.060
The barrier of entry is so low.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.220
I think that's what's part of what makes Python kind of Python.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:19.240
But there's also that piece that I have to remind folks is just because you can pip install

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.480
something doesn't mean that you should necessarily trust it with what's going to go on.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.980
Do a little bit of research.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.220
Go figure out what's there.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.960
Is this a mature library?

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.860
Are there other people using it?

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.500
Is it maintained?

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:35.880
And that's another skill set out of programming that network engineers need to start to learn

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:40.040
is that it's very easy to grab something and not understand what it is.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:44.560
And the skill set of not just copying and pasting from Stack Overflow is one that we have to

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.800
remind people over and over again.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.060
Yeah.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:50.520
That's a super interesting thing to evaluate an open source project, whether you want to

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.140
take it as dependency, right?

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:57.780
Because if you have a billion dollar company that depends upon this thing, but it's actually

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:03.100
some freshman students' little project that they threw up there that has four stars on

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:07.900
GitHub and they've since moved on to some other language and they don't even care about

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:08.240
it anymore.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.760
Like that's a shaky foundation.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.320
Exactly.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.860
But you got to know to look, right?

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.160
Audio bloop there for a second.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.540
The other piece that comes in that's very related to just like the reliability and the

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:23.980
upkeep for it is the impact of open source licensing that goes in at some of these areas.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:28.420
We're starting to get more and more conversations with lawyers getting involved to say, okay,

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.700
well, what is the impact of using that open source library?

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:36.220
Is there something in there that says that they have a portion of our company now because

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.540
we happen to use their library to configure our network?

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:44.420
And those are interesting discussions that as we start to code and just use community delivered

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.300
applications that I think it's not limited just to network engineers.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:53.220
But because we're new to the programmability space and we didn't cut our teeth through some

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:58.960
of these other areas, I've seen several folks kind of be very surprised to find out like

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.100
what the impact of some of these choices they've made has been.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.720
Yeah, it definitely can catch you off guard.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.040
So while we're talking about learning these new things and stuff you have to learn, maybe

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.120
it's worth highlighting this project.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:10.580
I don't know.

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:14.800
Would you call it a proper course that you created called Learn Network Programmability Basic?

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.700
Yeah, it's a great one that goes through.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:22.940
And so the Network Programmability Basics video course was designed very specifically to help

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:27.000
network engineers jumpstart into programmability and automation.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.060
The question we get more often than not is how do I get started?

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.520
Because there's this overwhelming nature.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.300
There's so many topics that are out there.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:40.140
And so what I did inside the course was kind of say, okay, let's break down the basic fundamental

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.540
information that you should know.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.700
So we talk about programming basics.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.680
So we go through some Python fundamentals.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.100
We go through what are APIs.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.720
We talk about those elements.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:55.960
And then we walk up the network structure tree, starting with device level APIs and then going

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.020
into like SDN controllers and network controllers.

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:05.820
We talk about capabilities around hosting applications at the edge, so some five computing pieces, and

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.780
then even get our way into kind of this net DevOps space where we're starting to treat the

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.780
network as code.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:15.460
And we're adopting things like configuration management strategies and CICD in the network.

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:20.480
The Programmability Basics video course is definitely not designed to turn someone into an expert.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:33.500
My goal when I put it together was to give enough background knowledge, define enough terms, expose people to some concepts, and give them a chance to run code themselves against infrastructure, kind of in a controlled fashion.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.280
And so that they can, they're more prepared to take that next step.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.760
To say, okay, I've seen a little bit of Python.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.260
I know what these APIs are.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.360
I know what the library does.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:52.980
Now I'm a little bit more comfortable to go kind of do a little bit of Googling and research to take a class on Udemy or go grab something off of another area or sign up for another piece.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:57.680
And that's really the focus of the material we have there is to do that jumpstart.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:03.380
I like to joke, my goal is to speed people up somewhere in the two to four months range, right?

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:08.200
Let's cut two months off of your journey to understanding network automation.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.840
If I can help you do that, I've been successful inside of that course.

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:12.700
Yeah, that's really awesome.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:26.540
And I think one of the jobs of the most powerful courses is not to teach you all the way down through the stack of what they're doing, but to expose you to just enough of all the things so that you're like, I know there's this thing that solves my problem.

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.120
And I know a little bit about it.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:35.660
And I now know where to go to look to learn it because it's almost like this paradox of choice or like this overabundance, right?

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.520
There's not a scarcity of things you can use.

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.300
It's there's so many things I could use.

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.420
I don't even know where to start.

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:45.240
And so having that like first step in the right direction for all these different things is really powerful.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:45.800
Exactly.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.220
And it's so easy to be overwhelmed in any topic today.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:53.100
I mean, the Internet just makes it ridiculous for how much information that goes through.

00:47:53.380 --> 00:48:02.020
And so that's been the purpose of the video course, as well as the other resources that we put together and we kind of curate up on DevNet to say, OK, let's give you let's give a network engineer.

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:12.820
Let's give a collaboration engineer or a server engineer kind of a somewhat curated entry point so that we can start to define those terms and expose them to what the art of the possible.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:13.180
Right.

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:16.320
I like to say my my job is an evangelist.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:22.400
The evangelism side of my job is to kind of show people what's possible, give them a glimpse of the future and get them excited for it.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:26.880
And so they're willing to invest more time and to go figure it out themselves and put the time.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.840
Yeah, I think that really sums it up perfectly.

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.060
So I think maybe maybe we should leave it there for the networking.

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:38.780
But I did want to ask you a question about PyCon because you're you're in Ohio and you were just at PyCon.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.680
It was in Cleveland this year, which is a great experience.

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:54.340
I feel like a lot of people don't go to PyCon because they're like, oh, that's for the hardcore developers that only like maybe speak to the people who are somewhat in your space who feel like PyCon isn't for them.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.320
What was your experience there?

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.900
I love my experience of PyCon.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.520
This was my first year going to PyCon.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.000
I'm looking forward to next year and going back.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.220
It's back in Cleveland again.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.880
So it's going to be super easy for me to get to.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.880
So I'll definitely be there.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.260
The organizers were super friendly.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:10.760
All of the presenters were amazing and going through.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:14.420
And that's one of the things I've really loved about the Python community in general.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:19.780
And it certainly showed at PyCon was the inclusive nature of where everybody's at.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:26.940
It doesn't matter if you have written a library that that 150,000 people are using on a daily basis.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:33.240
Or if you you've just written your first Hello World app, you will have a good time at a conference like PyCon.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:39.380
And then what was interesting for me from the network programmability perspective is I was just there kind of as an audience member.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.240
I was going through.

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.400
I was attending talks.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:47.740
And then they had open spaces where people could anybody could sign up for a topic, grab a room, and then people could go talk about stuff.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.620
And I noticed that somebody signed up a Python for network automation open space.

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:54.440
And I was like, wow, there's other people here doing this.

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.620
And so I went and kind of sat through it and talked with a whole bunch of other people.

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:07.940
And I was excited to see that there was probably 30 or 40 people there just at the open space part of it that were interested in using Python for network automation.

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:24.620
And these range from engineers from companies like Facebook and Netflix and Amazon, all the way down to small mom and pop shops that are just using a little bit for their own automation, as well as students that are just interested in networking and trying to figure out a kind of where Python fits in.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:38.200
And so I encourage everybody, if you have the opportunity to go to Python, whether it's the big global one, a regional one, or even one of the regional conferences that we just had, PyOhio here in Ohio, go become part of the community.

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.240
It's a wonderfully inclusive and welcoming community.

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.580
And you'll meet some really good people.

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.380
Yeah, that's great.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:51.180
I'm glad you brought up the open spaces because from the outside, the conference probably feels a lot like, well, there's these talks and the talks are on YouTube, so I don't really need to go.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:56.940
But I find the talks to be interesting and powerful, but actually, it's all the other stuff that makes it worth going.

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.620
Like, it's really amazing.

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.300
I think they called it the hallway track.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.880
You can't do the hallway track on YouTube after the event.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.440
You can only get that while you're there.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.980
Not unless you get a friend to stream it live or something.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.080
That'd be interesting.

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.020
Yeah, actually, it would, wouldn't it?

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.980
But like the open spaces are not recorded.

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:16.080
And you don't have to have any particular skill to run an open space.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:21.460
You have to have the willingness to put it on the board and the willingness to kick off the topic.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.740
But you don't even have to lead it.

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:26.480
You just have to say, I want a bunch of people who are interested in network programming to get together.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.440
And that's it.

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.700
You could be like, I have no idea, but I wanted to talk to you all.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:30.280
So here we are.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:30.880
Yeah, yeah.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.700
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:32.720
It's great to go through.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.140
So it's an awesome conference.

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.400
So I encourage everybody to go.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.900
If you're on the fence, sign up.

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.600
Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to going.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.260
I'll get my ticket soon as it opens up.

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:40.600
Exactly.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.480
All right.

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.700
Well, I think we'll leave it there for the topics.

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.820
So now we're down to the final two questions.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.720
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.100
Yes.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.800
So I go back and forth depending on what I'm writing.

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:57.760
If I'm writing Python code and it's focused on kind of a sample or demo or just kind of proof of concept,

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.600
I go pretty lightweight these days.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.380
And I use Adam because it opens quick.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:03.900
It has exactly what I'm after.

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.380
And no more, no less.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:10.320
When I sit down to work on an actual Python project, there's a couple of libraries I work on.

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.900
There's a couple of programs that I go through.

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:16.300
I always go back to kind of the first editor that I fell in love with, which was PyCharm.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.740
And so I always find myself back into PyCharm.

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.360
I love the integration capabilities that are there.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.800
I love being able to work just within the interface and go through.

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.920
And so I bounce between the two of those depending on which project I'm working on at a given point in time.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.440
Yeah, that's cool.

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.560
I do that with VS Code and the Python plugin and PyCharm, of course.

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.120
So something really, really quick.

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.700
I just want to open it up and look at it, probably throw it in VS Code.

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:37.960
But otherwise, PyCharm as well.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:38.360
Nice.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.060
It seems like there's a big debate in my team.

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.700
There's half of us that like Adam and the other half of us are big VS Code folks.

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:50.540
And for me, it's one of those like, if I've got something that works for me, I'm perfectly happy to use it.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.760
I don't need to go explore other tools that are there.

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.220
Yeah, sure.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:57.020
Well, you guys can at least now rest assured that they're owned by the same company.

00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:57.860
That is true.

00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:58.620
That is kind of funny.

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:01.300
I'll be interested to see if they end up merging as products.

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:07.340
I don't know if they will, but Nate Friedman, Nat Friedman, the guy who's going to be the CEO, maybe is the CEO of GitHub.

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:12.380
Now, I don't know when he officially starts, but he came out and said, we're not dropping Adam.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.400
We're going to keep working on it.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:13.980
People love it.

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.400
We're going to do these things at least in parallel now.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:16.780
That's good.

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:17.320
Excellent.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.100
Yeah, good to hear, right?

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:18.660
All right.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:19.340
Last question.

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:20.700
Notable PyPI package.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.440
I'm going to call out NC Client for me.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.560
NC Client's the NetConf client for Python.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.180
And I go back to it time and time again for my automation these days.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:37.040
Because as much as I love the higher order packages that we talked about, like Napalm and Nornier, I'm still kind of at the tinker level.

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.160
And I like being able to get right down into it.

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.760
So that's always one that I go back to.

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.120
Okay.

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:41.700
That's awesome.

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:42.880
All right.

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.980
Well, Hank, thanks for being on the show.

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:46.660
It's been really great to talk to you about all the stuff.

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:55.760
And I think there's a lot of interesting lessons people can take away from learning how network engineers are moving into this programmability because so many different disciplines are.

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.380
Absolutely.

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.120
Absolutely.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.100
Well, thanks for having me, Michael.

00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.060
I appreciated the opportunity.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:53:59.520
Yeah.

00:53:59.520 --> 00:53:59.940
You bet.

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.380
Talk to you later.

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:04.260
This has been another episode of Talk Python to Me.
