00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.860
Learning about programming libraries and languages is useful and interesting,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.920
but sometimes knowing why certain decisions were made or the history leading up to some change

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.280
or a package being created gives you a deeper understanding.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.540
And that's what this episode is all about.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.960
You'll meet Mike Driscoll, who runs PyDev of the Week.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.020
He also just published a really relevant book,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.200
Python Interviews, Discussions with Python Experts.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.080
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 156, recorded March 21st, 2018.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:45.960
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.020
the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.160
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.140
Follow me on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.020
Keep up with the show and listen to past episodes at talkpython.fm

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.580
and follow the show on Twitter via at Talk Python.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.820
Before we get to our conversation, I want to tell you about a project I've been working on for the past three months.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.720
Do you remember Bob and Julian from episode 140,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.860
where we talked about the 100 Days of Code challenges and their projects around it?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.540
Well, since then, we've teamed up and created a new course, 100 Days of Code in Python.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.180
This course has 18 hours of video lessons and around 80 hours of guided exercise.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.460
That's 100 hours, one for each day.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.400
If you're considering doing one of these 100 Days of Code challenges,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.620
please have a look at our course over at talkpython.fm/100 days.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.180
Now, let's get on to the interview.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.060
Mike, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.160
Thank you for having me, Michael.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.080
Yeah, it's great to have you here.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.680
I've been a fan of your Python Dev of the Week project that you've had going for a long time and things like that.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.020
How long has that been running?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.820
I think it's been going on now for almost three years.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.920
Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.900
That's like 156 interviews or something on that scale, right?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.360
That's cool.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.020
Yep, yep.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.560
That's correct.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.660
Yeah, nice.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.960
Awesome.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.960
We're going to talk about some of the interviews you did,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:14.720
not necessarily for that project, but somewhat in the same vein as that for this really cool book that you put together called Python Interviews,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.740
which I think is a great idea.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.180
But before we get to it, let's get started with your story.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.420
How did you get into programming in Python?

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.320
Okay, so I started out with your traditional languages in school like C++ and COBOL.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.320
I know COBOL isn't really that interesting anymore, but that was what I was learning back then.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.920
There was a part of the time where it was really good consulting, right?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.240
People really needed COBOL to help the transition, right?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.940
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.780
I do know a contractor who makes really good money doing COBOL for the government.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.700
So there's definitely a job still out there for you people who want to learn ancient, dead languages.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.840
I guess so.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.760
All right, so you started with those languages, right?

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.800
And you studied comp sci in college?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.880
Yeah, I went for computer science, and then I transitioned to MIS.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.580
Then I graduated, and the dot-com bubble burst, and there were no jobs.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.560
Oh, that hurts.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.840
And probably while you were in college, you were like, oh, my God, the jobs are so hot.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.260
I can't wait to get out there and work with a place with volleyball and massages.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.160
All the excesses of the day.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.300
Yeah, it sounded like it was going to be an awesome opportunity, and then I get out, and

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.720
I'm like, wow, I can't get a job anywhere because everyone has to have five years' experience

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.740
or more.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.760
Oh, that's rough.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.260
So what did you do?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:34.460
I actually worked kind of as a so-called webmaster doing front-page-based websites for an auction

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.800
company.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.920
Front-page is a product, right?

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.480
Like the thing that looked a little like Word but made websites?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.660
Yeah, the Microsoft product that's now dead.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.620
But yeah, I had created templates, and it was kind of pathetic.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.640
Yeah, it was a really interesting take on how you make the web.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.680
And of course, it was pretty typical of how Microsoft thought at the time.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.000
They don't do that anymore either.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.620
No, they don't.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.880
But anyway, I did that, and then the local county actually was hiring.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.740
And for some reason, they ended up choosing me, and they said, we're transitioning away from

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:11.460
Microsoft because every time we upgrade our VBA applications, like Office, it breaks all

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.160
of our apps.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.720
And we want to go to open source.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.680
And the language that my boss had chosen at the time was Python.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.720
And so he said, you can learn Python or, you know, you won't be able to work here.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.220
So I picked up Python on the job, and I got really good at it, and basically fell in love

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.800
with the language.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.720
That's really cool.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.340
What was your first thought when you kind of got that news?

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.220
Well, I was pretty nervous because I was like, I studied all this stuff in college, and now

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.420
I'm going to do a completely different language, which is very different than what they were

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.280
teaching in college.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.140
And they're just like, whoa, transition shift, you know?

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.340
It was a little trial by fire, but it worked out in the end.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.240
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.500
And then after that, you pretty much have been just sold on Python?

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.680
Yeah, I'm definitely a Python advocate.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.780
Yeah, of course.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.200
That's awesome.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.440
All right, so that's how you got into it.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.380
How about today?

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.280
What do you do day to day?

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.460
Currently, I'm working for an aid company that creates tools to actually kind of automate

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.300
and track what you're doing when you're planting and when you're harvesting.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.500
And they can basically plant your corn or your beans or whatever down to the centimeter,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.540
depending on your GPS quality.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.820
And what's cool about that, yeah, I know.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.380
And when I got into this, I was like, I didn't know that tech had reached the far world.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.680
That's really amazing what they are doing now in agriculture and, you know, in food produce.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:44.700
Yeah, one of the things I think is super interesting is just how diverse the uses of Python and programming are, right?

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.920
Like, I suspect a lot of people, when they think of farming, they probably think of large farms.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.900
They probably think of, like, John Deere tractors and stuff doing their thing.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:01.040
But they probably don't think deep IoT and a lot of code and automation and all that kind of stuff, right?

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.740
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.300
Yeah, I know I didn't.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.520
Yeah, I think there's actually some really cool stuff in IoT and farming, for sure.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.820
Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:20.340
They're getting more and more connected so that you can track what you're doing on your iPad and the display in the cab and on your phone, too.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.820
And everyone in the business or your relatives can kind of see how you're doing, basically.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.860
Yeah, that's cool.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:35.680
Yeah, there's a guy who was listening to this podcast and sent me a picture of, like, it being played or something while he was plowing a field in his John Deere tractor.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.900
He's like, yeah, man, I'm studying up while I'm working on the farm.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.860
I'm like, wow, that's really cool.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.620
So tell us about the app that you work on.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.600
What I actually work on is the testing of the applications that we work on for the agricultural company.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:56.080
So I write Python that uses a tool called Squish that connects to the C++ embedded application that we've written.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.260
And it'll actually instrument it and be able to press any buttons or grab any information out of it.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.840
And it allows us to test all of our different configurations.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.900
And do the buttons exist when they're supposed to or not?

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.160
Because we have permissions related to the type of owner or operator who's using the tool.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.100
Stuff like that.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.240
Basically, it gets pretty complicated.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:25.480
We have probably, you know, 300 or 400 tests just for the UI, not counting all the unit tests and other things underneath the covers.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.320
Right, yeah, that sounds pretty awesome.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.840
Sounds like a fun project.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.220
Yeah.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.880
Yeah, so let's talk about some of your books.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.880
So we talked about the Python Dev of the Week project, which is on the web.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.780
But you've written a number of books, right?

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.400
Yeah.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.180
My audience for my blog had been encouraging me for a couple of years to write a book.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.820
And I finally took them up on that and wrote Python 101, which was pretty well received.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:55.880
I did a Kickstarter for it to help get some publicity and just to see if there was any interest in it.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.320
And that was by far the book that got the most interest of any of them that I've written.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:08.160
And people are still buying it and reading it and, you know, telling me that they like it for the most part.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.360
Yeah, that's really awesome.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:18.840
So I definitely think these, like, if you look at what people are interested in, it seems like it might be most amazing to write some really advanced book.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.120
But it's really the foundational stuff that actually most people are interested in, right?

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:31.560
Like, if you wrote, like, the internals of AsyncIO, even though it might sound cooler than Python 101, like, it wouldn't be the same, right?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:31.880
Yeah.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:41.820
I've noticed that with the more specific topics you get, the smaller the audience chunk is because there are just less people that are going to be interested in that specific topic.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.580
Yeah, for sure.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.280
So I think launching it on Kickstarter was a really good idea.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.320
You know, I launched my training company on Kickstarter as well.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.280
And it just was really surprising.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.200
But it was also, it really took a lot of the edge off.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:04.860
Like, after a week, you're like, okay, there's enough interest in this for me to pursue this project that it's not just me thinking of an idea and going, I hope it's good.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.320
We'll find out in six months.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.900
But, you know, you put it up there, people, like, commit to it right away and give you feedback.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.040
And it actually guides a little bit of what even you might build, right?

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.360
Yeah.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.280
That's actually why I liked Kickstarter is that I got to work with the people.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.120
My early readers got to have feedback early on in the process.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.380
And I was able to actually take some of their ideas and be like, this is awesome.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.580
Let's add this to the book.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.620
Or let's add that to the book.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.340
Or this actually isn't a good idea to talk about.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.620
Nobody's interested in this topic.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:33.880
Yeah.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.980
Yeah, that's really, really cool.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.140
So then you also did Python 201, Intermediate Python, right?

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.120
Was that also on Kickstarter?

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:40.740
Yes.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.640
It definitely was.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:49.000
And it got a lot of interest as well, although maybe not as much as, of course, the first one.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.400
But a lot of people thought it was really interesting, and they took it as a good stepping stone to the next level, I think.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:02.320
One that you did that really sounds super interesting to me these days is WX Python Cookbook and Recipes.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:02.860
Yeah.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.700
So Daybreak's Python Cookbook.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:10.340
I've been working with that community practically from the beginning of my time starting with Python.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.180
And I thought, you know, I've written a lot of recipes on my blog.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.160
I should clean those up and write some new ones and create a book around it.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.420
And so that's kind of what I did.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.700
And then A-Press came along and said, hey, we like that book.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.100
We want to compete with Pact.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:30.560
Could we, you know, license it and give it our brand and call it Recipes instead of Cookbook?

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.440
And so...

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.040
That's interesting.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.080
That's kind of how that ended up happening.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.640
Yeah.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.120
So does this cover the WX Python Phoenix or does it predate that?

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.620
And how different are those?

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.360
Yeah.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.680
It does cover Phoenix, which is now WX Python 4, actually.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.280
I tried to do both 3 and 4 when I wrote the cookbook itself.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.960
And then when A-Press came along, I kind of updated it.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.880
So most of it is just for 4.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.160
But I did leave a little bit of legacy code in there to kind of show the difference.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.380
The big things that have changed is that Robin Dunn, the creator of WX Python, switched from SWIG to SIP.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.820
And so the layer between Python and C++ is thinner.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:18.040
And it makes doing Python 2 and 3 a lot easier for him.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:28.520
But otherwise, it's just like, you know, he deprecated some certain naming conventions and just little things that have bothered him for, you know, who knows how long.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.020
Probably a decade.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.620
And now he's finally gotten it nicer.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.040
Yeah.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.680
Yeah, that's cool.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.800
All right.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.960
I want to talk about your main book and really dig into that one.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.480
But you have one that also was on Kickstarter.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.740
I know because I backed it.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.400
And I don't know if the – I think the Kickstarter is done, right?

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.320
Called Report Lab.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.920
Want to tell us about that?

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.340
Yes, that Kickstarter is over.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.780
Okay, cool.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.140
How did it go?

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.060
I thought it went okay.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.240
I thought it might be a little bit more interest than the WX Python one.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:04.140
Because my Report Lab articles on my blog get way more hits than my WX Python ones do.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:11.500
So I just thought, you know, Report Lab is going to be more interesting than WX Python is, at least book-wise.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.600
But, oh, well.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.260
It's been really good.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.000
I've gotten good feedback.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.920
I've got good people telling me some good ideas.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.240
And the book itself is coming together really, really well.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.660
And since a lot of it's like brand new content, I feel like that – I just feel really positive about it.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:32.980
Because usually when I'm writing everything from scratch, it takes a lot longer.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.620
And it's just kind of like coming right out really smoothly for me.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.000
Oh, yeah.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.960
That's really great.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.540
And so this basically teaches you how to do PDF processing in Python, right?

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.140
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:50.680
And Report Lab is for creating PDFs and basically laying out the page in your PDF.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:13:07.220
I also have a part of the book that's going to talk about some other Python-related PDF tools like PyPDF2 and PDFMiner that will show you how to export data from your PDF or split your PDF into multiple pages or join multiple PDFs together.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.020
Different things like that that Report Lab doesn't really do natively.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.200
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.420
I definitely want to study this because I need to create some PDFs for various things on my site.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.800
So I'm excited for this to come out.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.380
When's it coming out?

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.460
It'll come out in June or maybe even May if I'm lucky.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.720
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.800
All right.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.220
So let's talk about your book that you do have out.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.160
This is probably the most recent one published, right?

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.680
The one called Python Interviews, Discussions with Python Experts?

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.180
Yes.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.720
That one was released earlier this month, actually.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.500
Yeah, nice.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:44.920
And this one is published through PAC, whereas your original WXPython cookbook and your other ones as well, were they self-published?

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.060
Yes, that's correct.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.940
Interesting.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:47.400
Okay.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:54.100
So maybe give us the quick trade-off between self-publishing and, say, working with PACT or someone else.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:01.100
The main thing I like about self-publishing is I know when I release, I know the name of the book.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I have the control over the book.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:15.780
I have the control over the quality of the book, and I can also see how it's selling at any moment in time because Amazon and LeanPub, the two primary places I sell my book, actually have graphs.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:25.200
And they can tell you in real time how many units have sold in a day, whereas if you work with a publisher, you have to wait quarterly for updates.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.840
Right.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.320
So you have no idea if the book is selling well or not.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:35.320
And you have no idea how much of that cut you're going to get either, depending on the sales that were done during that time period.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:35.720
Yeah.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.160
So.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.000
Yeah, interesting.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.520
Okay.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.680
So this one is with PACT, and I think it's a really interesting idea.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.220
So you went through and you interviewed 20 notable experts in the field.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.300
I'll just read off some.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.520
Mike Bayer, Brett Cannon, Nick Cogan.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:57.000
You had Jessica McCuller, Carol Willing, Al Swiger, Jake Vanderplast, and a bunch more.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.560
All those people I named, by the way, have been on the podcast.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:06.300
So I feel like you've done this sort of interesting book equivalent, sort of a podcast, right?

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.060
Like I'm going to go inside and get the stories of these people behind these major projects, right?

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:11.800
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.560
Yeah.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.220
Nice.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.200
So I guess maybe let's start at kind of a high level.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:24.040
One thing I wanted to ask you is like, what's your takeaway from all the time you spent interviewing these people?

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:33.240
Like what perceptions or thoughts maybe changed about ideas that you had going in that afterwards you're like, oh, no, actually, this is totally different than what I thought it might be.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:42.380
I think the biggest takeaway for me is how big AsyncIO has gotten in asynchronous programming in general.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:49.700
A lot of the people I talked to were excited about it and excited to have it added to the standard library.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:58.240
I think I had a couple people who were pretty kind of cautious about AsyncIO and they thought its implementation wasn't as good as it should be.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.460
Or they just didn't think it was a good idea in general.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.660
But overall, I got a kind of a positive feedback loop from that that, hey, this is really good.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.420
It needs some improvement.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:14.080
We're going to make Python use it in a way that is really easy to use.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:26.240
Yeah, I feel like if you're in a situation or position where AsyncIO will really solve the problem, it's like such a great thing to have it.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:33.500
But a lot of people write code that has no use for it and it just seems like confusing.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.680
It adds complexity and why is this thing here?

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.280
But if you happen to need it, then you definitely, definitely can benefit from it.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.120
Yeah, I totally agree with that.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:50.580
Yeah, I think the one area that we could use some more help on to really jumpstart this is really the major web frameworks.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:55.080
If they could somehow be like natively Async capable.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:02.320
Yeah, I know Glyph was trying to do that, but he was trying to make Async native.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:10.440
Even though it is technically the Async socket library already, he's going to start using the Python Async library in the internals of Twisted.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.360
That's pretty awesome.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:18.740
That way you can chain your Async stuff with the lower level Async stuff in a more continuous way.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.140
Yeah, I thought that was a really neat idea.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.120
Yeah, pretty cool.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.260
Okay, other takeaways?

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:31.460
The other takeaway, and I kind of noticed this at PyCon last year, is that machine learning and data science has gotten really big with Python.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:40.860
And so there was a lot of excitement about that and how Python is just like kicking butt in that sphere, that business area.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:46.460
And it's bringing in a lot of new people that don't really know Python at all or programming in general.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.200
And they're getting introduced to Python, which I think is really cool.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.980
Yeah, I think it really has opened up a whole other aspect.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.860
And you're right, it is a big theme in the book from what the people talked about.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:10.000
So what I want to do is just go through and we'll pick out a couple of the folks you interviewed and some of the things that I found notable in your conversation with them from the book.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.500
And maybe we could just touch on those a little bit.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:17.920
So there's 20 people here, and we can't go through all 20 of them, I don't think, unfortunately.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.840
So people are saying, if I don't cover your thing, it's not that I didn't like it, just like I ran out of time.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.280
So time and space.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.500
So let's start with one of the core developers.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.700
I really like Brett Cannon.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:36.080
So yeah, Brett, he lives sort of in my neighborhood, if you think globally and define a sufficiently large neighborhood.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.700
Sort of the Pacific Northwest area anyway.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:49.820
And so one of the things that he touched on that I thought was pretty interesting was the sort of idea of like, can you know it all, even within this Python sphere, right?

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.800
Like, can you know all of Python?

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.780
Like, should this even be a goal?

00:18:53.780 --> 00:19:00.980
And of course, like, there's the Python and the runtime, but then there's also all the libraries and external stuff, right?

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:01.540
Yeah.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:09.220
Talking about that, he said something to the effect of, Guido famously was once asked at Google, on a scale of 1 to 10, how well do you know Python?

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:09.980
He said 8.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:15.200
Yeah, I've noticed that Google has that on one of their, and part of their interview processes.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.240
You know, how well do you know something?

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:22.780
You know, one is, you don't know it at all, and one is you wrote the book on it, or you wrote the language.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.440
So I find it really interesting that Guido himself is like an 8.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.300
But I totally agree with that.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:34.500
While I consider myself to be really knowledgeable in Python, there are libraries that I've never used in the standard library yet.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.400
Yeah, same here.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:35.700
Yeah.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.180
I think it's really interesting, right?

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.860
And at first you might think, well, how is that possible?

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.020
He created Python.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.940
But he's not the only one, right?

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:53.320
There are tons of people working on major changes and optimizations and whole new aspects of Python that maybe he just looked at the PEP and said, that's a good idea.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.560
Send us a PR.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.180
Yeah.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.580
Yeah, I totally agree with that because there's a lot of people who did it who worked on it.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:08.300
And I think even Brett would say he doesn't know it all, even though he did claim, I think, during the interview that he had touched pretty much everything in the Python internals at one point or another.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.860
Right, but how much of that sticks, right?

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.380
Yeah, I know.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.140
So another interesting –

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:14.820
I just have to look up stuff.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.040
Yeah, of course, like distributed cognition.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:17.800
We have the internet.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:27.140
So another thing that he touched on that's really important right now and is going to be increasingly important over the next year and a half is moving to Python 3.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:32.460
He said, I hope people realize that you can transition to Python 3 gradually.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:41.520
It doesn't have to be abrupt or painful, and he referenced the Instagram thing where I was actually at the keynote at – what was that, 2017?

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.340
PyCon 2017?

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.440
I think it was.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:43.880
Mm-hmm.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.680
Definitely in Portland.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.180
Yeah.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.840
I was actually doing this at work last year.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:56.060
I was trying to transition our automated test framework from Python 2 to Python 3, and it really wasn't that bad.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:02.280
I got the code working, but I wasn't able to get all the tooling to work because of issues with our vendor.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.880
But it really isn't that painful.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:12.040
I thought it was actually fairly easy, and we have probably 10,000 lines of code or more just in that one testing framework.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:17.400
Yeah, I think to me, when I look at the changes, I'm like, none of these are major.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.720
They're really, really not.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:28.920
The one place where it gets really kind of tricky is at the network layer where you're trying to sort of switch to Unicode versus bytes and strings and all that.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.280
But other than that boundary, it's really not that big of a deal.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:37.500
I think part of the major challenge for people is we have this huge thing.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.260
It's working.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.780
Please don't touch it.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.140
Yeah.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.180
Yeah, I agree.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:51.560
The issue that I think we found the most painful was writing binary files out, and we were using byte strings, and we had to convert one way or the other.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.080
And that was a little bit trickier in Python 3 when I wasn't expecting that.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.600

Just visit talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:56.120
So another thing that Brett talked about that was pretty interesting was the mythical Python 4.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.720
Like, will it be a Python 4?

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.160
What's going to be in Python 4?

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.500
Will it be as painful as 2 to 3?

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.680
Yeah, so he had some interesting ideas.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.780
Obviously, it's not going to be any sort of thing like going from Python 2 to Python 3.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.220
But he talked about some things like switching to a tracing garbage collector instead of reference counting.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.900
To help with things like parallelism and stuff.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.960
And this parallelism is another theme that actually came up a lot in the book.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.520
Basically, taking advantage of multi-core processors.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:37.200
Yeah, there was several people who were bringing up that topic and how Python is usually kind of given a black eye about being too slow in a lot of cases.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.800
When in actuality, if you use it correctly, you can get a lot of speed out of Python.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:48.220
Or write your stuff in Python and then switch to PyPy or some other type kind of thing like that.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:54.760
And you can quadruple your output or your speed just by little tiny changes like that.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.060
But yeah, Brett was definitely talking about that.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.640
And I think Barry Warsaw was talking about removing the GIL.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:07.800
So yeah, there was a lot of different back and forth about how we could make parallelism in Python better.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.620
Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.440
So let's switch on to another one of your interviewees, Steve Holden.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:21.440
So one of the ideas that I thought was really interesting, and I touched on it recently in another episode,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.760
and I can't remember who I was talking to about it, which is really unfortunate.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:33.300
But it's the idea that the sort of forward progress and overall maintenance of Python and the ecosystem and whatnot

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.380
continues with no professional organizers, right?

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:43.840
Like you've got Microsoft completely controlling something like C#.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:52.260
And anything that happens, there might be community input, but there's this giant company whose job it is to decide what the next steps are.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.020
Whereas with Python, I guess there's just none of that, right?

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.680
There's just us.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:58.620
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.540
The only thing that's really behind Python is the Python Software Foundation.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:08.320
And it just kind of guides the community into how things should work.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:15.100
Yeah, they're more to support things than it is to specify directions, right?

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:22.440
Like the PSF doesn't go, we need these three features and this library upgraded and this thing done for Python 3.7, right?

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:22.960
Yeah.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.740
Yeah, they just provide funding and protect the Python brand.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.300
They don't really say, we need X, Y, and Z.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.280
Exactly.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:42.260
Yeah, they actually have a, they kind of handle the corporate details and like chasing people down if they mess up with the copyright and funky stuff like that, which is a bit of an odd job.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:47.960
It struck me as odd when I first heard it, but it's, you know, if someone's got to do it, like they're the people to do it, right?

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.440
Yeah, someone's got to do it.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.380
You don't want people using the Python name inappropriately.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.420
Yeah, for sure.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:26:04.540
So another thing that Steve Holden talked about was also the mythical Python 4, but he had a different take, which I like this idea in general.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:12.260
So he said, basically, you hear loose talk of Python 4, but to my mind, Python is now at a stage where it's complex enough.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:19.780
There's so many languages that just seem to like need another feature every release.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.280
We're going to have four new keywords and you're going to use it in this way.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.360
And it doesn't matter if you really need those keywords.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.420
Like there are language designers whose job it is to design the language.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.840
So when a new version of language comes out, like they have new features, needed or not.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.360
All right.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.800
I'm thinking like JavaScript is a little bit like that.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.420
Maybe C# is definitely like that.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:42.840
There's a number of languages where there's just this expectation that there's always new stuff.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.960
What do you think about that?

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:50.560
Yeah, I kind of feel like we don't really need anything brand spinky new in Python anymore.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:57.080
There's some controversy over adding f-strings because we already had two or three ways to do string interpolation already.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.840
I think f-strings are kind of cool, but did I need them to do my job?

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.280
No.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.520
So I can see where Steve's coming from with that.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.940
Yeah, I feel the same way, actually.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:13.900
The one language feature that comes to mind, I'm like, yeah, that really does something different is the async and await keywords.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.680
Yeah, that one is definitely new.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:22.460
And while, like I said, a little bit painful, especially with the first implementation, it is getting better.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.460
And it definitely does something new and different in the language.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.120
Right, right.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:30.140
Whereas like the fifth way to format a string is certainly debatable about whether it's needed.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.420
There's not a fifth way to like asynchronously work with I.O.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.580
That is part of the language, right?

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:35.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.020
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.620
Obviously libraries.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.340
Yeah.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:45.140
I kind of wonder sometimes, though, why they didn't continue working on the futures library because it seems to be kind of just kind of died off now.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.540
Oh, yeah.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.540
That's a really good point.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.760
Like maybe put some trial stuff.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.360
Float some trial things.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.120
Maybe even an external package that you can bring in and try and see what sticks.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.960
That'd be pretty cool.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:07.060
So another thing that Steve talked about was sort of the excitement of Python being the main programming language for people coming in in education.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:17.560
And I think this touches back to his previous comment as well, which is like hopefully this will keep Python in a space where it's relatively comprehensible.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:25.720
And these like easily accessible tools for building rich applications will be available to people for like the next 20 years at least, right?

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:30.780
So like really having a – not losing the ability of people to get into Python easily.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:37.600
Yeah, I think that's really awesome that Python has gotten a hold in the education sphere so much.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:43.580
I think I read earlier this year that MIT, all of its intro stuff is in Python now.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.060
Oh, that's sweet.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.600
And I think I was at university, which is where I did some of my studies.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.900
They're starting to use Python now in some of their intro courses.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.300
And I just think it's really cool that it's spreading like that.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.820
People have asked me if they can use my book as kind of a trial run in their classes.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.940
And I'm like, go for it.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:28:59.720
See if it works.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.720
If it doesn't, let me know.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.920
So it's just really cool what's going on with Python in education.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.940
Yeah, and I think – absolutely agree.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:14.360
And I think part of what he was touching on, you know, I called out JavaScript in particular earlier about gaining all this complexity.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:20.660
Like before Node.js, JavaScript was this incredibly easy place to get started.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.440
Like maybe you'd go crazy and throw in some jQuery or something.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.460
But you write a few functions.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.500
You do some stuff.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.300
And now, you know, you're requiring this.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.580
You're injecting that.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.800
You're transcompiling that other thing.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.680
It's just like, whoa, this is like not the same space.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.620
It's quite complex.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.320
In a couple years.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:54.140
Yeah, JavaScript is kind of mind-bending right now with which products do you need to know to actually produce a website that's, you know, cool and useful that isn't full of a bunch of buzzwords and broken pieces in a year or two.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:30:00.060
Yeah, it just seems like this went so far off the deep end of going, oh, we're going to do all these things and bring all this stuff in.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.540
And there's also not consistently one way to do things.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.240
It's just, it just seems unnecessarily complicated.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.780
Like I think one of the powers of Python is it starts super easy.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.480
You can have a really complicated, complex architecture, but it's not required.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.020
You know, where it almost is these days to use a lot of the web stuff.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:24.460
Yeah, Python is definitely has a nice easy learning curve until you hit some of the more advanced topics.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:24.700
Yeah.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.020
Which is what you'd expect.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.120
It's ideal, yeah.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.720
So let's move on to another interviewee, Carol Willing.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:36.180
So she ran the PSF for a while and she's done a bunch of cool stuff.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:42.940
And I think the first thing that I noticed from your conversation with her was the concept of Python as a mosaic.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:49.000
And this was really laid out super clearly by Jake Vander Plaas at PyCon 2017 at his keynote.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.640
Where it's just these people are coming from all these different disciplines.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.280
And you touched on this as well at the beginning.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:02.360
That like all these different ways and types of programming and areas of programming are coming into Python.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.760
And probably making it stronger for giving it these different perspectives.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:12.820
Yeah, I've noticed, especially like I said at the last PyCon, you had data scientists, astrophysicists.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:19.700
People, they had a course for middle school and teenagers to learn Python at PyCon.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:24.180
And then, of course, you had the people like Glyph who does Twisted.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:28.640
You have all these asynchronous people and people from Instagram and the business side.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.380
And it's like, wow, you have all these disciplines.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.920
And they're all using the same fun language to do really cool things.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.500
Right, exactly.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.420
You had Instagram talking about how they were running their whole thing on Python.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:45.680
But you also had Jake Vander Plaas going, these three major telescopes that are being launched in the next couple years.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.180
Here's their API.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.620
It's in Python, right?

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.320
It's just like the juxtaposition.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:51.880
It's amazing.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.700
You can go read their code.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.340
Exactly.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.480
Yeah, it's really cool.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.460
And you're just touching on astronomy for a minute.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.120
Like what's really cool is they had another language.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.580
It's still around, I'm sure, for astrophysics called IDL, I believe.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:08.400
And that was a commercial language.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.980
You wouldn't even compile your code.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.480
You pay money to get the compiler and the license just to work on that.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.720
And here you have, oh, yeah.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.820
Now we're just going to put it on GitHub.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:18.940
And it runs on Python.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.880
And now we're talking to space.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.500
Pretty cool.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:29.680
Yeah, I think a lot of the data scientists are getting away from that because they have Mathematica and some of those other math languages of sorts.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:35.920
And they have to pay big, big bucks to do their job.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.900
And now they can use open source and share it with the world.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.900
Yeah, it's super amazing.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.420
Like I came from a math background.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:47.880
I've worked at this company where we had to do wavelet decomposition of like time series stuff.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.320
And that originally was in MATLAB.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.920
And we were converting it over to a proper programming language.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:33:00.100
But just to get the little extension to MATLAB so that we could do that, I believe, was $2,000 a person.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.980
Just for the extension for the wavelet deco.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.820
Not the whole thing.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.160
Just that little bit, right?

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:05.820
It's like, wow.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.240
That is intense.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:21.540
Yeah, we have some tools in the agriculture field that are very similar to that where you have to spend a lot of money to compile from one language to another language or do exactly what you just said because we also use MATLAB as well.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:21.800
Yeah.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.120
Yeah, but we have things like SageMath, Jupyter.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.400
There's a lot of stuff that's coming along to disrupt that.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:34.080
I think those days are somewhat numbered except for maybe really niche stuff, which probably is for the better.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.580
Yeah, totally.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:41.160
So another thing that Carol touched on I thought was cool is what I'm going to call sort of Python for all.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:47.660
So she has a data science background and does a lot of stuff with Jupyter.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:59.520
And so she talked about the rise of Python in education, but also the rise of Chromebooks in education where you can't really install anything on your Chromebook.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:10.980
And so, you know, providing every student some kind of web account into something they can do Python on and give them the same tools and the same experience, which I think is really empowering.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:17.900
Yeah, I think if we had a couple more places where you could actually do Python in the browser, that would be really, really powerful.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.880
You know, I know that a little bit and it's pretty limited right now.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:32.420
But I think we're getting there to the point where we could actually start saving the Python scripts to the cloud and running them in the cloud in such a way that the student could learn how to do it.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.720
And that would be really awesome.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.660
I think it is really awesome.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.860
And I think at that level, the notebook type answers are really, really interesting.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.460
So like Azure has, I think, free notebooks.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.560
Google has a notebook solution.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.840
JetBrains just came out with Data Lore.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.680
All these like are hosted online.

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:54.980
You log in, you save your stuff, you know, you run and it runs there.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.900
So those are pretty cool.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:01.400
Even on the Google one, you could even hit like, you know how you like shift enter in notebooks to run it.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.760
There's like a modifier key to run this cell on a GPU.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.840
Like, and that's it.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.500
You just, you have like a different hot key to run on the GPU.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:14.020
I mean, it's like, wow, that's quite different than.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.040
Yeah, I hadn't even heard of that.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:16.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.920
So I covered it on Python Bytes a little while ago.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.240
I can't remember the name.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.320
I'll try to put it in the show notes.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.460
But yeah, there's, so I think some of these things are coming along.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.880
You have Python anywhere?

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.720
Python everywhere.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.480
Sorry, guys.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.820
It's actually, if you go to python.org.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.660
I didn't realize this for the longest time.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.800
If you go to python.org, there's those little screenshots of text.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.440
And there's a little like prompt looking button.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.180
If you press that, it'll actually open up a remote terminal, Python anywhere.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.240
And you just start typing.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:46.360
I knew it had a terminal, but I didn't realize Python everywhere was underneath it.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:46.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.840
So pretty, pretty.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.440
That's awesome.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.120
Yeah, it's pretty cool, right?

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.760
But I think we need to be aware that so much of education at the lower levels is running

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.500
on Chromebooks.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.940
And you can't pip install anything on the Chromebooks, right?

00:35:58.940 --> 00:35:59.900
You don't get a terminal.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.840
You get basically flavors of Chrome.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.740
So having a really good way to bring people on there is quite cool.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:10.560
So, you know, another thing that comes to mind is Anvil.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.620
Anvil.works.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.060
They basically let you create web apps and the whole IDE is in the browser.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.760
So you can pretty much do that from Chromebooks as well.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.500
It's kind of cool.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.320
That is really neat.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.180
So another thing that Carol touched on was the community.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.020
And so did Brev.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.980
It was basically, I came for the language.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.140
I stayed for the community.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.760
I think that's one of Python's superpowers.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.680
How about you?

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.100
Oh, yeah.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:34.940
That's definitely what kept me going with Python is, you know, I have questions.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.500
I go ask and I ask them.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.640
And you don't usually get into a flame war.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.500
You usually get people saying, hey, this is how you do it.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.860
Or ask the question better.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.540
They're not like, that's a dumb question.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.940
It's actual real answers the time.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:52.620
And I really appreciate that they're so helpful.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.720
And they'll sometimes even give you some sample code to point you in the right direction.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.820
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:04.180
Also, I think, you know, you go to the Python conferences and they just feel different than like a standard tech conference.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.760
They feel, I don't know, more representative of the general population.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.280
People seem quite open.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:17.940
And, you know, just the whole community seems to really carefully nurture that aspect more than other communities I've been part of.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:29.560
Well, what I really liked about it is that you'll sit down at a table with a bunch of strangers and you'll be surrounded by people who are just starting Python or people who are like working for major companies.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:35.380
Like I sat at a table with Apple and Pixar and major school, university.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.520
And I'm like, wow, I wasn't expecting to sit with these kind of people today.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:38.780
Yeah.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.880
You know, they're all friendly.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.280
Yeah, it's really, really cool.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.160
Definitely.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:47.440
So opposite of superpowers, maybe one of Python's weaknesses.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.360
And I've been on a bit of a rant about this as well lately.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.240
But Carol talks about, you know, we need a better story for mobile.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.720
And I'll throw desktop development in there as well.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:12.220
There's Kivi, which does let you create apps, but it's not the same experience as, you know, storyboards and Xcode stuff or, you know, IDE for Kotlin for Android, things like that.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.580
Yeah, Python really doesn't have much besides Kivi.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.880
And I think Toga is the other one that I've heard about, but haven't actually tried.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:27.460
But yeah, there's basically nothing besides those two and maybe some like underlying libraries that Kivi relies upon.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.400
And it would be awesome.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.680
Does that shock you a little bit?

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.820
Yeah, it does.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.540
And it kind of bugs me that that happened.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:42.020
And I think Alex Martelli said that Guaido had tried to talk to the people at Google when he was working there to get them to include Python.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.320
Right, right, right.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.560
And Andy Rubin, yeah.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.740
And the guy was like, we don't need more than one language for Android.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.160
Java's amazing, so we'll do that.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.840
And I'm just so disappointed that Google decided to do that, you know.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.440
Yeah, that's really, it really is unfortunate.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:04.600
Anyway, it just seems strange to me that there's such a hot development space and there's just not really an answer for it.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.200
And I think it's a couple of things.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:14.380
I think it's a little bit of the myth of boiling the frog slowly in the hot water type of thing in that.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:24.280
Like it's even hard to just take your Python application and give it to anybody like say on Linux or Windows or whatever and go here, double click this.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.360
Right, that's not an easy thing in Python.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.380
And it should be, right?

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:38.900
So if it's hard to even like move your code from one place to another, like to package it and compile it for another platform, it's just like, well, we haven't solved this like first step.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:43.140
So we're not going to go on the, you know, one mile journey to get to mobile.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:40:02.440
Yeah, that's something, and then we didn't really talk about it during the interview process, but that's something I think would be awesome in Python for is let's have that built into the library so we can actually export the application to any XE or Linux tarball or whatever you need to install on Linux, you know, because every flavor of Linux is different.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:17.680
That would be a game changer if you could just go Python space, you know, --build this folder with this entry point, and then you get a thing that you hand out and there's no dependency on Python, there's no dependency on the libraries, it's just packaged up, and it's ready to go.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:27.820
Like, I know there's PyInstaller and certain things, but there's just all those things feel 85, 90% done, but then there's this weird glitch on this one framework or on this one platform.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.800
You're like, why does this come on Windows show when I say no console?

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.180
Like, it's just, you know, just stuff like that makes me crazy.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.140
Yeah, those things are pretty aggravating.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:45.120
I think the Windows executables that they create are probably better than, I've had better luck with that than I've had with any of the other platforms so far.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:51.040
But it's just, it seems so fundamental that, like, I want to build a program and give it to someone else.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:58.920
Like, why is that not one of the first things that is, like, super focused on, I want to build a program and distribute it, right?

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:04.620
I know, it bugs the heck out of me when I first started learning Python was, how do I do this?

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.240
And it took a while.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.940
It took a lot of trial and error to get it right.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:08.600
Right, and you can't do it.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.420
I mean, it has just lots of sharp edges, though.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:25.860
So, yeah, if I can put in a vote for what is a major feature in the next version of Python, whether that's 4 or 3.8 or 3.9 or whatever, like, make this packaging thing just absolutely a non-issue.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:29.380
A binary comes out, you hand it off, it runs and all the, you know.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.720
Maybe you've got to build up each platform.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:31.140
I don't care.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:31.620
That's fine.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.360
But something you can send out, right?

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.100
Yeah, I totally agree with that.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.880
That would be wonderful.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.820
All right, two votes.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.040
I'm sure it's going to happen now.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.920
Fingers crossed, anyway.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.100
So, you already spoke about Glyph.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.560
Let's talk about Glyph Alipowitz.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:42:08.320
So, one of the things he talked about, and this was also touched on by Guido in the PyCascades keynote, which was in this past January, the transition of Python 2 to Python 3 as it was sort of managed by the core developers and the PSF and just generally.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:18.220
And I think the main takeaway was they didn't realize how popular the thing they had created was and how much code was already in place.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.720
So, basically, how much would have to be migrated?

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.500
Yeah, there's a lot of legacy Python 2 code.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:27.800
I've been doing Python since, like, 2.4, I think.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.520
And Python 3 came out, like, two or three years after I started doing Python.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:38.440
And I've never worked in my 12 years of doing Python in a company that actually uses Python 3 regularly.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.800
Everything uses Python 2.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.760
So, what do you think about the 2020 end-of-life date?

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.580
Do you think that's going to make a big difference for you guys?

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.580
If I'm still at my company, I'm going to make sure we're already on 3.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:53.400
But there are a lot of companies where I can see where they're like, it's going to cost a lot of money.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:43:00.700
And we're just going to keep running this code until we have to for security reasons or some other monetary reason for change.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:06.880
I wonder how well-managed that's going to be versus how, like, headline-driven it's going to be.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:20.160
So, for example, I think the biggest distributed denial-of-service attack that's ever been launched was because a bunch of Memcached servers were left on the internet unprotected.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:25.040
And they had this, like, vulnerability where you could send one UDB packet at it.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.820
And it would basically dump the memory contents at, like, an address you pointed at.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:39.660
So, you could get, like, a 50,000 multiplier of, like, your bandwidth against, you know, there's just, like, thousands of these on the internet that somebody pointed at GitHub and went after.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.380
Somehow GitHub survived, actually.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:48.560
But anyway, if there's something like that and you're like, oh, you just do this to all the Python 2 things running and you own it.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.680
Or, you know, you look at Equifax or something like that, right?

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.800
One of these really bad sort of headline-driven things.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.740
I mean, that would possibly get people's attention above the developer level.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:03.460
Yeah, I think that's what's going to be, you know, unless they can just, like, kind of sneak it in.

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:08.020
A lot of developers are going to be stuck with Python 2 for a long time.

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.580
And, you know, it's a good language, but they really need to move to Python 3 if they can.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:13.520
Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:19.480
And increasingly, there's a lot of things that are inaccessible to Python 2 developers.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.640
You know, API Star, Django 2.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:30.560
There's just a bunch of things that are coming along that are only Python 3, which is an interesting twist because the story is to be told exactly in reverse why you stay on Python 2.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:37.880
Yeah, we're finally at the point where Python 3 is getting all tools and all the tooling, and it's not always getting backboarded to 2.7.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:44.880
So, you know, if you want to use the new cool stuff that the cool kids are using, you've got to go to Python 3 right now.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.760
Yeah, for sure.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:53.440
So, another thing that Glyph touched on was a little bit of a similar idea that you and I were just talking about with packaging.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:45:03.900
And said, like, one of his main thoughts of where he thinks Python should go is to make PIP, to get away from using pip as a tool for installing apps for users.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:12.560
And also touched on just the GUI, like, there's not really any built-in way to create a Python GUI, be it mobile or be it desktop.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:17.660
So, I don't know what else to add to that, but we've kind of, you know, just one more voice.

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.520
Maybe he's a third vote for us in this packaging story.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:28.300
Yeah, TK Enter is still kind of ugly, but I will say it has gotten a lot better than it was when I first started using it.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:33.180
Yeah, I've definitely seen a few examples recently, like, oh, that's actually not as bad as I remember it.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:39.560
But it doesn't feel like, wow, this is an amazing UI framework that I just can't wait to build my apps on.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.940
It seems like, well, it's not as, I guess I could live with that.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.520
And that's probably not where you want it to be.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.980
What's funny is they added a new library called TTK to it.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:50.920
And there was, like, no advertising, no nothing.

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.780
So, I didn't even know it improved a lot.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:53.360
Yeah, I didn't either.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.420
And I don't think a lot of people realized that.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.700
Yeah, the only way I found out was I complained about it.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.220
And somebody said, hey, I made some pretty good-looking apps with it and sent me some GitHub repos.

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.640
I'm like, those are good-looking apps, really?

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.420
Oh, interesting.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:11.360
Another person you spoke to was Doug Hellman, who does the Python module of the week.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.100
And he's been doing that for 10 years.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.540
That's a pretty interesting series.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.260
His website is pretty good.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.980
I used to use it a lot for when I needed to look up something.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.780
Yep, it's definitely, definitely cool.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:27.460
So, you know, another thing, Doug mostly works on cloud and OpenStack and things like that.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:34.480
But, you know, just keeping with this theme, like, the main takeaway from your interview with him was that we need better packaging.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.340
Right?

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.660
We still need another way.

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:45.420
But his take was that this is not directly related to Python itself, but it'll get into all the tools, like set of tools, Twine, Wheel, Pip, Warehouse, and so on.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:54.000
Yeah, it would be really nice if we had a common base framework to just make all those tools work the same way.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.720
And we'd have a unified way of distributing and packaging our applications.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.380
Yeah, definitely.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.920
I could go, we could have an entire show on that.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.020
But, I don't know.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:09.360
I don't, I don't really like to complain without providing the answer.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.960
Like, at least a suggested, like, this is bad.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.220
Here's a possible solution.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:18.360
But, yeah, I think this, the packaging thing would really make a huge, huge difference.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:22.360
I was just going to say, I keep hearing good things about Briefcase, but I've not used it myself.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:28.680
So, that's something people could look at, I guess, or at least contribute to if they thought that would be helpful.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.720
Yeah, absolutely.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:36.740
I just, you know, it seems like something built in that you just know you have and it just works.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:37.200
I don't know.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.920
We need some advocates and the core developers to do that.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.020
Well, and that's why I said it's kind of like a boiling the frog problem.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:51.900
Like, as, by the time you get into, where, like, you're in a position you could make these kinds of changes, I feel a lot of people are like, well, we're kind of good enough.

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.640
I've got a requirements.txt or, hey, didn't we just create pip file?

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:56.760
Like, didn't that solve?

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:01.860
I feel like the pain, by the time you get far enough into it, the pain is not high enough anymore.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:10.540
But if you go and you, like, teach a little one-week workshop at a high school and the kids say, well, how do I share this with my friends?

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.360
Well, you can't share this with your friends.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:12.760
I'm sorry.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.540
Like, I mean, that's almost the answer.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:15.320
Not quite.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:23.700
But can you tell your friend to go, like, download Python from python.org, change the path, pip install the stuff, and then run?

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.920
Like, that is a large step if that's, like, a 12-year-old kid, right?

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:27.680
Yeah.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.540
And that just seems not amazing.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.460
Okay.

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.600
So let's speak about amazing stuff, though.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:37.620
Another person that you interviewed that had tons of interesting things to say was Alex Martelli.

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.060
Yeah.

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:38.900
Alex was awesome.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:39.480
Yeah.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:46.520
He really mentioned the Stack Overflow thing that talked about Python's incredible growth.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:57.300
He said, the forecast is that Python will become the most popular programming language and one of the most active, with one of the most active developer groups behind it by early 2019.

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.140
That's pretty awesome.

00:48:59.140 --> 00:48:59.660
Yeah.

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:06.260
I've been amazed just looking at the statistics about Python over the last, like, two or three years and how it keeps skyrocketing higher and higher.

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.840
And, you know, that brings back the data science part.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:15.700
I think that is driving a lot of that interest is we have a really big chunk of that now.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:23.120
And if everyone wanted to do machine learning and AI and neural networks, it just, use Python.

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:23.840
It's easy.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:28.380
And when you need to speed it up, you can drop back down to, you know, a low-level language.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.080
Or Cython or PyPy or something like that.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:43.180
So one of the things that I haven't heard talked about, I haven't talked about it before, but if you look at that Stack Overflow article, the incredible growth of Python, they have some really cool graphs, right?

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:48.320
And they show Python sort of just eclipsing Java and JavaScript.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:52.840
But then the predicted growth, like, the derivative is obviously much higher, right?

00:49:52.840 --> 00:50:06.360
But the other thing that I haven't heard anyone talk about is if you look at the Java curve and the JavaScript curve, they have huge, like, bi-yearly humps that are, like, many percent.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:13.240
And what I think those mean are those are the people taking the class at that time.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.500
So they go and they do a bunch of interaction with Java or JavaScript.

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:20.060
And then their semester ends and it drops back down and then it humps back up.

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.260
And you see these humps, like, twice a year every year.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.080
You don't see that in Python.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.140
Isn't that interesting?

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:29.820
I mean, it accounts for, like, 5% or 10% of the traffic.

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.280
And you look at Python.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.020
Python is a smooth curve.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:38.640
And it seems to me like people are made to take some of these courses voluntarily and voluntarily.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:39.900
They are part of their schooling.

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:46.640
Whereas Python doesn't have these humps, which I think means, like, it's more genuinely adopted.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.040
I don't know.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.460
I may be reading too much into it.

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.280
But I thought that was a pretty interesting thing.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.700
I could totally see that.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:56.020
I mean, once you've used Python, why would I use another language unless I have to?

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:56.980
Okay.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.700
So let's see.

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:02.180
I think one of the things you're kind of getting short on time here.

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:11.080
But one of the things I want to talk about that Alex focused on was what I'm going to classify as Python as a competitive advantage.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.340
I guess there's a couple of things.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:16.940
He said he ends up talking to these big internet companies.

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:23.680
And they seem to use Java or some other core language, Go maybe, I don't know, as their main language.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.840
But they're acquiring these other companies, right?

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:32.020
Like, they're buying these little startups that are, you know, getting ahead and creating amazing things.

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.700
He said a lot of them are buying these Python-based startups.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.040
And that's coming back in.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.440
And they're having to sort of absorb Python into them.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:46.360
But he said what's really interesting about that is an example with, say, YouTube.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:50.120
So before I read your book, I didn't know there was a thing called Google Video.

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.120
Had you heard of that before?

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.580
Yeah, I actually had.

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:54.340
I used it briefly.

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:54.800
Yeah.

00:51:54.860 --> 00:52:00.720
So Google Video was this thing that was a YouTube competitor or something to that effect, right?

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.620
And Alex was at Google at the time.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.800
I think he still is.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:11.020
Anyway, he said Google Video kept losing the feature battle to this tiny startup just a few miles away.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:20.840
Each time this little startup unveiled a new successful feature that the customers liked a lot, our engineers would scramble to pick up something similar in a few months, right?

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.980
And they said they were basically amazed that these 20 guys were outclassing hundreds of engineers at Google.

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:33.820
And, of course, he said, well, the reason they were so productive was they were using Python and Google Video was using C++.

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.220
And that's the thing that became YouTube.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:41.380
I've been trying to advocate in my current job that we might not be able to use Python in the embedded application side.

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:50.480
But we could do so much prototyping and other things with Python to help us figure out what works and what doesn't work before we go to the embedded side.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.380
We could be so much more productive.

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.720
We have so many more new features or products.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:59.900
And it's just a slow uphill battle when you have a lot of C++ people there.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:05.360
Well, and the people writing the embedded code are probably, you know, they've probably been doing C++ for many, many years.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.540
And, like, why would they change?

00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.820
Et cetera, et cetera, right?

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:08.100
Yeah.

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.660
Have you guys looked at MicroPython?

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.160
Is that relevant to you?

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:11.820
I don't know.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.040
It might be relevant to module side.

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:23.960
I don't think it would be for our actual main bread and butter display because that thing has to run really, really fast with the number of operations it works with.

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:24.140
Okay.

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:24.500
Interesting.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.460
All right.

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.000
I think there's still so many more things we could cover.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.680
I'm going to do one more, which I think is a really interesting and positive way to leave it.

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:38.740
So you also interviewed Barry Warsaw, who's been around the Python space for a long time.

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.980
And one of the things that he talked about was Python's strength.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:48.640
And he said, I think one of the real strengths of Python as a language is that it scales.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:56.820
And he's not talking about, like, well, on this Linux server and I add this many requests to it, it gets, like, this sort of scale curve or whatever.

00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:00.020
He says, I'm talking about the human scale.

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:04.200
So, for example, you can have one person write a little script on their laptop and solve a problem.

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.360
And Python's good for that.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:11.420
You can have a little startup or an open source project with 10 to 15 people working on it, and that's great.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:15.760
And you can have hundreds of people working on large projects, and it's still great.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:21.400
And it's sort of this idea of the elasticity of the architecture needed to build Python apps, right?

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:26.780
They can start really small, but they can stretch without breaking the language to things like YouTube.

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:27.300
Yeah.

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:34.140
That's something I've always liked about Python is you can start small and keep adding more and more to it.

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:51.460
And while there's a little bit of hesitancy on my part for the new typing module, I can see that that would be really helpful for people who are used to statically typed languages and how that might help them get into the Python sphere and, you know, get used to the language quickly.

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:56.800
We just have to be careful that they don't bring too many of their idioms into the Python part.

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.520
Yeah, it's going to be an interesting marriage.

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:02.900
You know, the more I play with the type annotation stuff, the more I like it.

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.880
But I find I don't cover everything with it.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:10.880
I cover just like a certain few functions, and then the types sort of flow to the rest of it.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.200
And I'm pretty positive on it these days.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:13.520
Yeah.

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.880
I think it has some downs.

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.600
But yeah, I agree.

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:15.720
Yeah, for sure.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.560
So I guess we'll leave it there.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.440
You know, I found your book to be really interesting.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:26.920
There's a lot of folks we didn't get to cover, and there's just a bunch of little insights like this.

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.420
So hopefully people will check it out.

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.280
Where can they find your book?

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.520
It's on the PAC site, I'm sure.

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.480
It's on Amazon, things like that.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.760
Yeah, it's on PAC publishing.

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.500
And yeah, and then Amazon.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:36.100
Yep, yep.

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:36.820
All right.

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:37.740
So well done.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:41.500
I thought it was a good book, and I definitely enjoyed the insights that you got out of it.

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:42.080
Well, thank you.

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.200
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:43.420
Yeah.

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:44.280
How long it takes to write?

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:49.600
I did the interviews over about nine months, and then you had to do editing after that.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:55.320
So we'll call it around 12, just to kind of even it out, even though it didn't really take quite 12.

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.140
It's a pretty serious project, though.

00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:58.200
It took some time.

00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.740
Yeah, it took a long time.

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:00.540
Yeah, cool.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.400
Well, hopefully you're proud of it.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.100
I think it came out good.

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:03.500
Thank you.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:04.200
Yeah, you're welcome.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.420
I think we have time for the final two questions.

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:11.120
So if you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you open up?

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.580
I usually use Wingware's IDE.

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:19.280
I prefer that, because I found the debugger to be the most useful for live debugging.

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:25.120
But I also use PyCharm, because we have to use it at work for the automated test stuff.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.700
And I can see why people like it.

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:29.460
So I'm a little torn at this point.

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:30.880
Which is my favorite.

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:33.360
Do you want some kind of offspring of the two?

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.180
Yeah, pretty much.

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:34.540
Yeah.

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.300
Someday.

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:36.700
Who knows?

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.880
Very cool.

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.380
Yeah, I definitely am a fan of those as well.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:43.800
And then notable PyPI package or packages.

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:48.340
So for me, I've been using Report Lab a lot because I'm writing a book on it.

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.480
But I also used it a lot in my previous job.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:54.160
And it's just incredible what you can create with Report Lab.

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:58.580
Pretty much any document you see, or even this book, the Python interview book, I could probably

00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:01.600
create with Report Lab with a little bit of time.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.780
Because you can just create templates and it'll whip through that and generate whatever you

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:06.060
want.

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:06.680
That's awesome.

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:07.960
Yeah, I'm definitely checking it out.

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:08.860
Yeah, that's cool.

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.020
I like WX Python, which I've already mentioned.

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:17.880
It's great for creating UIs across all three major platforms with very little or no changes

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:18.760
across platforms.

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:23.540
I've written a code that works on all three without having to do anything running the code.

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:31.520
I definitely think it has the best overall experience for the cross-platform Python-based apps, right?

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.960
It looks like it belongs on those platforms and it feels modern and nice.

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.620
Yeah, it works really, really well, in my opinion.

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:39.200
Very cool.

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.220
All right, Mike.

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:44.660
Well, thank you so much for taking the time and also for doing all these interviews with

00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:44.980
everyone.

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:46.220
It was great to chat with you.

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:47.420
It was good to chat with you, too.

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:48.300
Thanks for having me.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:52.500
