00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.840
One core question around open source is how do you fund it?

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.280
Well, there's always that PayPal donate button,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.040
but that's been a tremendous failure for most projects.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.420
Often, the go-to answer is consulting.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.660
But what if you don't want to trade time for money?

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.300
You could take things up a notch and change the equation

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.300
and exchange value for money.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.140
That's what Ines Montani and her co-founder did

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.320
when they started Explosion.ai with spaCy as a foundation.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.680
Listen to her story about building a sustainable software business

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.140
on open source and Python.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.960
This is Talk Python to Me.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.620
Episode 202, recorded January 30th, 2019.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:50.040
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.080
the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.020
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

Ines, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.400
Yeah, it's really nice to be here.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.660
Thanks.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.600
It's really excellent to have you here.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.680
You gave such an excellent talk at EuroPython in 2018.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.620
And I just wanted to have you on and talk about that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.800
and share some of those ideas.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.840
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.540
Yeah, I think so too.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.920
For sure.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.720
Before we dig into those, let's just get started with your background.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.140
How did you get into programming in Python?

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.260
Yeah, it's actually kind of interesting

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.580
because I would say I don't have the typical programming background.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.920
So I started...

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.820
You didn't write games at five years old?

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.560
No, but I started making websites when I was like 11,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.640
when we got our first computer.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.640
So I first started in Microsoft Word.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.180
And then I, you know, it was back in the day

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.020
when you could just look at the website source and copy it.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.680
And so I would do that and always build websites.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.780
And I did then decide when I was older

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.100
that I wouldn't want to do this professionally.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.080
Like for some reason, it never appealed to me.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.980
But I, so I worked in media, I worked in marketing,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.380
and then eventually ended back at programming

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.700
when I realized that I could combine all the things I liked into a job

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.880
because I also did linguistics in uni.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.700
So I was always interested in language.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.360
Yeah, that's a really interesting background.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.560
You don't think of that as a normal path,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.880
like marketing into software development,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.900
especially something like data science, right?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.500
Where it's really deep.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.160
But I guess that ties more into your linguistics side of things, right?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.440
Yeah, and spaCy, especially.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.640
Like spaCy, when I started working on spaCy,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.260
I realized that, wow, I can really combine what I liked.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.580
For example, front-end development with a bit more programming,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.380
other types of stuff with language

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.460
and really, you know, using computers to understand language.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.640
That was kind of like the perfect combination of stuff.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.300
Yeah, that's cool.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.780
Was that kind of how you got into Python

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.700
because the NLP side of things?

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.360
Or where was Python in the story?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.220
Yes, mostly, yeah.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.480
Nice.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.680
And today you're running a business of your own,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.840
doing some really cool stuff, which we're going to dig into.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.280
Maybe just tell people quickly about what you do day to day.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.040
Yeah, so our company is called Explosion AI,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.580
and we mostly develop a lot of open source software.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.340
One of those projects is spaCy,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.100
which is a popular library for NLP and Python.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.100
We also publish other products and other tools

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.080
for software development developers.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.000
So we're a developer tools company.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.960
It really sounds like such an interesting project.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.260
And I love how you have spaCy

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.040
and you kind of built a proper business on top of it,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.100
not, you know, just throw like a PayPal donate button on there

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.480
and hope that that does something right.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.320
Like, but legitimately building something on top

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.440
of this open source stuff that you all have going on,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.940
which is great.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.420
We definitely spend some time thinking about

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.800
how we could best do this,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.060
but it combines all the things we like doing.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.000
It's really nice to have an open source community

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.040
to put our stuff out there.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.020
So yeah, we're very happy with the way we've made this work.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.600
Yeah, it seems like it's working out really well.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.720
So let's dig into this idea of building a software business.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.980
You know, it's something I'm very passionate about,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.480
something that I've done, right?

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.920
I have my own business and work for myself as well.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.860
And I think one of the things that really appealed to me

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.900
about your talk was,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.340
it kind of pushed back against some of these startup,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.640
San Francisco, high growth VC type mindsets

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.520
that are fine for some things.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.020
But it seems like a lot of folks see that and go,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.820
oh, well, if Instagram raised all this money

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.920
and it was successful,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.060
I'm going to have to raise all this money

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.580
for my new text editor or something silly

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.100
that doesn't fit that mold, right?

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.540
Yeah.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.540
No, that's definitely,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.860
that's something we see a lot.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.820
And I think, of course,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.080
I understand why this narrative is so prominent

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.880
because it's also,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.340
it's often pushed by people who like that narrative

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.300
because it makes the money.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.760
And also, I'm not saying

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.140
it's the wrong narrative for everything.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.900
But like, definitely,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.200
I think there are lots of businesses

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.740
that also work very well

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.900
if they're not following the typical startup playbook.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.580
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.840
You know, I think it's partly popular

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.600
because it's a little bit like winning the lottery.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.500
People like these winner takes all scenarios.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.140
People like imagining that type of success

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.560
and going after that.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.020
So I think it does play to some of the instincts

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.780
that we all have probably.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.880
Yeah, probably.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.040
I will get into more detail about this,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.320
but you talk about selling what you currently have

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.140
versus selling potential, right?

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.740
Like, hey, this is going to be great

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.080
if we just had $100 million in VC money

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.500
and we could get everybody to use it.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.280
Think how amazing that would be, right?

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.660
And I feel like that's also a little bit,

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.620
I don't know,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.040
I feel like so many of those things

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.980
are a little bit shallow.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.520
And I don't know,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.740
that's not quite the right word,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.340
but it's like,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.920
they're not really creating meaningful things for people.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.600
they're just trying to get a bunch of people

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.120
to use something silly

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.140
so that then somehow they can skim a bit of money off of it.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.560
Yeah, you're selling the potential to make future money

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.460
because the idea is,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.360
of course, if you take $100 million in funding,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.140
you need to deliver a lot more than that.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.260
So you're basically,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
you're working towards that future

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.620
where you're going to make $100 billion

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.240
rather than the present

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.420
where you could be making $200 million,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.540
which they still are pretty,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.880
I would say I would call a business

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.200
with $200 million profit,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.960
I would call a successful business.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.560
Unqualified success, right?

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.500
But in this venture,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.960
sort of win the lottery thing I told,

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.740
like that actually would be kind of a failure, right?

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.160
Like just doing double what you did

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.340
in raising your money,

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.160
that would actually be

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.180
probably not enough to make the investors happy.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.540
Like they look for more than that generally.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.040
I mean, it's better than failing, but still.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.300
Yeah.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.840
Yeah.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.940
So let's talk about your journey

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.380
and your project,

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.860
your company, Explosion AI.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.420
So I guess maybe just set the background,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.720
like how does Explosion AI and spaCy,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.500
and we'll talk about some of the products you have,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.760
how does that whole history fit together and whatnot?

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.780
My co-founder, Matt,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.080
he used to work in academia.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.260
So he was a researcher

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.120
and he was working on NLP

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.060
and he very early on saw that,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.780
oh, this is getting,

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.120
this is finally getting useful.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.240
We're finally getting to a point

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.100
where this can actually be used

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.320
in like commercial projects and help companies.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.200
So he left academia and started writing spaCy.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.720
So he basically,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.600
he was in Australia,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.060
he moved to Berlin.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.200
He took some time off

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.700
and focused on the open source project.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.600
And that's kind of the early beginnings.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.540
And we met here in Berlin

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.980
and we started working together very quickly

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.480
because he always had ideas

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.020
for like visualizing the software,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.960
making it more accessible,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.400
making it more usable.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.420
And that's also something

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.540
I was very interested in.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.380
So we started working on spaCy

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.700
and this worked very well.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.340
So yeah,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.740
we founded Explosion AI together.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.300
And of course we had to think about like,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.320
well, how do we make money?

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.320
how do we fund what we're doing here?

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.720
And so for the first,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.040
I would say six months,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.820
eight months,

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.180
maybe we did consulting.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.200
So we really,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.620
there were lots of companies

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.560
who were interested in that.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.540
So we did have the advantage

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.480
that we had spaCy.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.660
People liked our work,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.900
wanted to implement this better.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.480
And yeah.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:23.920
That's cool.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.640
That seems like level one

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.400
of this sort of like,

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.580
how do I make my open source project

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.340
or my open source success or passion

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.340
be my job?

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.160
And like,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.700
I guess level zero is

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.020
create a successful thing

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.200
that is open source, right?

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.140
You got to start with that.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.560
And then level one is

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.020
I'll do consulting,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.220
high-end consulting

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.540
as the creator of this project, right?

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.400
But you all were looking

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.480
a little bit beyond that,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.940
which I thought was pretty cool.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.420
And you,

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.680
I really liked this phrase

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.840
you used in your presentation.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.120
You said to sort of

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.000
get the project going,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.460
we raised a client round

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.420
and we went like,

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.320
you did consulting

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.100
and you made money

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.440
to like fill in the gaps

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.960
until enough momentum was there

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.860
and the products were there

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.440
and stuff, right?

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.660
Yeah.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.720
It also helped us get

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.520
all these insights

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.100
that otherwise,

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.580
even venture-backed startups

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.360
have to do this too.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.160
Like you have to talk

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.720
to your users

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.580
or potential users

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.060
and find out what's working,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:12.940
what are their problems,

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.540
what are you really going to solve?

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.520
And that kind of came

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.940
almost for free

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.020
with consulting

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.840
because we actually

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.640
worked with users

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.720
who were already using

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.720
open source projects.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.240
We saw what they were doing.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.500
We really also prioritized

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.620
companies who already had

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.700
something running

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.800
that they wanted to improve.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.720
So yeah,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.320
we got to see,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.560
okay,

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.340
what's working for them?

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:31.840
What isn't,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.260
what are the main pain points?

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:33.880
And one of them

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.080
was really creating

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.160
training data

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.160
for machine learning models,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:37.800
which is what

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.520
then really convinced us

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.540
that like this idea

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.220
for Prodigy,

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.280
our first product

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.420
was definitely something

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.920
we should invest more into

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.420
and launch

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.460
as soon as possible

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.460
because that's really something

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.000
that people wanted.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.540
Absolutely.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:48.860
I mean,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.400
that seems like

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.800
the perfect follow-on,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.100
right?

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:51.960
And we'll talk,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.980
we'll talk about that

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:53.860
in just a second.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.020
But I think one of the

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.020
really important things

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.680
that maybe I would guess

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.300
you gained through

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.040
that whole experience

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.940
is you not just learned

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.920
what people want

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.440
and need,

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.180
but you also made connections

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.800
with these,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.580
these big companies

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.720
as you consulted for them.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.780
They probably trusted you.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.260
So you could say,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:09.400
hey,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.000
we have this thing

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.740
that's going to help you

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.680
if you all want to get it.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.340
It probably,

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.380
it's almost like

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.240
building an audience

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240
of folks

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.100
who will be your customers

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.760
before you're trying

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.080
to make them your customer.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.020
What do you think?

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.320
Yeah,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.740
that's true.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.100
And I think that also happens

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.160
with the open source project

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.500
because,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:24.840
you know,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.760
if you want to convince people

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.380
to give you money,

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.300
you need to show them

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.660
why they should give you money

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:29.640
and not some other guy.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.320
And so,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:30.640
of course,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.400
the open source work

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.220
can function in that way.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.220
People see our software,

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.180
people can see

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.540
that we can build useful software

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.600
and it makes it easier

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.500
for them to trust us

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:37.700
that,

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.260
of course,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.600
the software we're selling them

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.460
will also have

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.180
a similar quality

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.340
and solve their problem

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:42.900
in the same way

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.420
space it in.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:43.740
For sure.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.260
So,

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.040
let's talk a little bit

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.700
about Prodigy

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.880
and that's your first

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.660
paid for product.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.780
You go to the website,

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.780
it has a,

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.720
how much does it cost?

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.720
You put in the credit card

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.200
and you get it,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.440
right?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.040
It's not like,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.760
well,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.360
you sign up,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.360
we're going to market to you

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.280
and then maybe we'll run

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.420
some retargeting ads

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.240
on you or whatever.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:01.480
Like,

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:01.640
no,

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.160
no,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.160
just you come,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.400
you find the value,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:04.880
you pay for it,

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.000
right?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.140
So,

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.960
tell us about Prodigy.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.180
Yeah,

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.980
so Prodigy is

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.400
an annotation tool mostly

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.560
that helps people

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.300
label data

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.860
for machine learning projects

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.000
and run experiments

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.500
because the idea is,

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:15.720
okay,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.520
if you're using a library

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.120
like spaCy

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.720
or any other

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.940
machine learning solution,

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.060
you ultimately,

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.440
once it's really giving you

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:21.960
a lot of value,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.640
you want to train

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.400
your own systems

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:23.880
that are very,

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.460
very specific

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.500
to your problems

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.140
that you're solving.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.080
For example,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.080
you get a lot of

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.780
customer emails

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.580
and you want to

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.220
have a system

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:30.880
that automatically

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.920
labels them

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.100
whether they're about

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.380
an invoice question

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.380
or whether they're about

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.180
some other problem

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:36.960
the user is having,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.920
whether it's a complaint,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.740
whether they're happy.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:39.400
So,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.260
that type of system

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.280
and you need examples

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.940
for that.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.100
So,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.080
you have all of your emails

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.520
and you want to train a system

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.020
and for that,

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.360
you need to label the data

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.060
and often,

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.980
you need to label it

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.700
10 times

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.620
until you find a way

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.100
that works.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.120
That's very tedious work

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.380
so we've thought a lot

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.560
about how can we make it simpler

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.260
and one conclusion

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:56.940
we ended up with

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:57.500
is that it needs

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.400
to be a developer tool,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.300
the developer needs

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.060
to run it locally,

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.180
needs to be able

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.680
to quickly also program

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.460
their own workflows.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.340
It needs to be a Python library

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.340
that you can interact with.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.880
It can't be just some app

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.940
that's on the internet

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.660
and you need to have

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.280
that control.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:10.840
Yeah,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.760
it's not going to do it,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:11.900
yeah.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.160
Yeah,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.120
and also it's what

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.900
people are used to

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.520
working with.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.180
Like we think,

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.260
or we call it

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.200
let them write code.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.760
We think that

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.240
developers want to write code.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.000
That's not an issue.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.480
It's actually,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.280
it's a feature.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.040
You know how to write

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.940
a function in Python

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.480
no matter how you want to do it.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.680
If you can write it in Python,

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.840
you can use it in Prodigy.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.080
Yeah,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.540
it's really cool

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.240
because most people

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.800
doing something with spaCy

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.020
or other machine learning

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:34.280
are,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.600
chances are

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.380
they're already

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.560
somewhat competent

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.580
with Python anyway,

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:38.940
right?

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:39.780
And so you might as well

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.320
just leverage that

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.460
and that sounds really cool.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.280
And also a big reason

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.480
people are using spaCy

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.440
and open source tools

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:45.860
like that

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.600
is because they want

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.700
to build their own systems

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.840
and implement them themselves

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.660
and also because

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.980
often the data

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.660
they're working with

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.500
is not just something

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.180
they want to upload

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:53.840
onto the internet

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.880
and they usually,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.380
they probably also shouldn't.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.360
Like they're building

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.180
their own systems

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.020
which means also

00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.660
their other tooling

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.940
needs to fit

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.960
to that kind of workflow

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.560
they've set up.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.840
the data needs to stay

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.620
on their machines

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.860
on their service.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.620
It can't just be sent to us

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.480
and Prodigy really fits

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.040
neatly into that kind of workflow

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.480
and it's been,

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:12.700
yeah,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.560
it's been very popular

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.320
and we're very happy

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.000
that we were able

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to provide more value

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.420
to our existing users

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:17.740
that way.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.600
It sounds like a really great product

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.220
and it sounds like

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.200
it's been pretty successful.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.040
You talked in your presentation

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.300
about having two products

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.160
that you're working on

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.220
that are kind of follow-ons,

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.300
one called Annotation Manager

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.320
and one called Datastore.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.060
Do you want to tell us

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.240
about that as well?

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:31.460
Yeah,

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.580
the Prodigy Annotation Manager

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.960
or what we're now calling

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.720
Prodigy Scale

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.360
is basically an extension

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.780
that lets people scale up

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.000
their annotation projects

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.120
because once you've found out

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.620
an approach that works,

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.680
you often want to have

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.440
more people labeling your data

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.500
and you want to be able

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.660
to see what they're working on.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.200
You want to be able

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.580
to farm out texts

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.400
to people who might not

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.740
be sitting in the same office.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.180
You also want to compare

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.840
what they're labeling

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.040
to see if there's a problem.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.260
Maybe someone's

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.400
misunderstanding the question.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.120
That can lead to

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.460
lots of hassle later on

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.920
and ideally you want it

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.560
to be accessible

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.400
over the internet.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.100
And so that actually,

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.060
it's been under development

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.640
for a long time

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.320
and it was a very,

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.200
come up with an infrastructure

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.480
that does not compromise

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.060
on data privacy

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.040
while still offering

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.920
a software-as-a-service

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.880
like FIO.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.840
So you still log in on our website

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.220
but you're also running

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.960
a local cluster

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.180
that farms out the work.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.080
And so the data never

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.020
goes through our service

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.580
so it directly goes

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.360
via your cluster.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.300
Your annotators can access it.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.060
They still have the same

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.660
nice feeling of accessing it

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.060
through a web app we own

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:32.960
and we run

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.300
but you don't have to send us

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:34.640
your data

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.620
and we don't store your data.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.280
Yeah, that's an important thing

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.420
that you talked about a lot.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.520
How basically,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.280
a lot of these high-growth

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.060
VC companies,

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.000
their goal is to race

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.220
for as many users

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.240
as you have

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.320
so you can

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.040
so you can basically

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.000
own their data

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.840
infer things about them

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.020
and then try to sell them

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:52.680
something or sell

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.940
marketers to them

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.960
or something to that effect

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.500
you know, Facebook

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.340
or whatever, right?

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.600
Yeah, that's not very important

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.200
to us, no.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.120
It just doesn't sound like

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.260
it's going to fly very well

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.380
with machine learning, right?

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.280
You want to send

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.700
your most important

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.500
data flow of your company

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.060
probably containing

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:07.880
private information

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.460
through it, right?

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.040
That just,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:09.980
that needs to be

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.820
something private, right?

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.560
Yeah, and we do have

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.260
a lot of users

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:12.920
in, for example,

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.080
the healthcare field

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.220
who are actually also

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.500
working on very interesting stuff

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.240
and for them

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:17.900
it's just like

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.820
an absolute no-go.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:19.700
Like, they have their

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.620
very secure

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.720
audited environments

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.400
that they can have

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.120
their data on

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.840
because it's maybe

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.360
sensitive patient data

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.060
and that's it.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.340
And so they need tools

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:28.740
like that

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.060
and they're very happy

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:30.800
about tools like that.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.340
Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.260
You know, we have

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.940
laws like HIPAA

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.480
in the US

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.240
about healthcare data

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.640
but also things like

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.100
GDPR in Europe

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.860
and even Washington State,

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.760
the next state over

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.160
from Oregon,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.000
is working on a GDPR-like.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.120
Yeah, I read that.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.720
I think GDPR

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.720
is a good thing.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.880
I'm a fan of

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.320
regulations in general

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:50.980
if they're reasonable.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.980
Not saying that everything

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.620
that comes out of the EU

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.940
as regulations is great

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.740
but I do like

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.060
the general sentiment

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.900
of those kinds of

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.600
privacy laws.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.280
Yeah, I think there's

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.160
a big pushback

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.340
on the overstep

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.600
and misuse of people's data.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.580
So this trying to build

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.000
your business

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.680
on people's data

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.920
is, I don't know,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.060
maybe it's a little shaky ground.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.560
So it's good that you are not, right?

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.040
Yeah, I also,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.240
I think it's just not necessary

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.300
and that's kind of,

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.060
also that's one thing

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:14.820
I try to get across

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.660
also with that talk.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.820
It's like there's so many other ways

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.000
you can build a business

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.780
that's very sustainable

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.520
so you don't even need to do that.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.500
Yeah, I do think that people

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.440
are kind of myopic

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.400
about seeing VC funding

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.460
as the only way, right?

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.740
Like it's, I don't think so.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:27.920
Yeah.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:28.640
Now, one question

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.500
I did want to ask you

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.700
and not quite seriously

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.860
but just to get your thoughts

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.400
on this, right?

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.320
Because I would,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.860
I've made the same decision

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.200
but why not just keep consulting?

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.400
You had six months of this,

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.820
I'm sure it was going really well.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.160
You're like,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.020
oh, we could totally

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.200
just continue to consult

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.960
and a lot of people

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.780
go down that path.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.560
I think it's a little more risky

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.960
to start a business

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.720
and spend your time on that.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.480
So what was your thinking?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.500
Why go,

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.460
no, we're going to build

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.700
something, a product

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.420
and we're going to sell it

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.340
rather than try to just

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.800
keep working for Bosher?

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.560
Or whatever, right?

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.280
It's a good question

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.360
and I think to some degree

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.580
it comes down to personal preference.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.940
Like there are other companies

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:03.600
in our space

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.680
that are doing very well

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.260
with consulting

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.860
but I think you do get

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.600
to a point where,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.340
okay, if you want to scale consulting,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.020
you do also need to,

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:11.920
you need more consultants.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.520
You need to,

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.640
then you're actually running

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.100
a consultancy business

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.960
and you're managing

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.740
other consultants

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.700
and that's just not really,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.940
also that we see,

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.640
we don't see this

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.360
as our strengths.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.180
like we are quite aware of,

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.000
okay, what are we good at?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.760
Where do we have an edge?

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.360
And for us,

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.380
that's building good developer tools

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.420
and we always thought

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.360
we were a good team on that.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.760
And the nice thing

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.760
about selling software

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.720
is that you can sell it,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.960
you write it once

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.160
and then you sell it lots of times

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.200
and that's like,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.000
in terms of a business,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.560
that's very good.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.260
You have one thing

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:37.760
and you sell it

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.200
and it doesn't,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.340
it's still there.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.760
You sell copies of it.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.900
I totally agree.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.120
That touches on something

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.640
I deeply value these days.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.820
It just seems so important to me

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.880
that if it's possible

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.480
to trade value for money

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.240
rather than time for money.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:53.540
Yeah.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.580
I mean, I've always had a good job.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.040
I've had a lot of freedom in my job,

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.740
but you know,

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.060
when I was doing full-time work,

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.520
but it was like,

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.600
well, you can't really go on vacation

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.000
with your family this month

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.080
because there's that project

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.980
and it's just,

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:04.360
you know,

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.940
it's not the same feeling

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.300
of I'm going to create something,

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.440
people like it,

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.700
they find a lot of value

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.140
and it's just a little

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.200
exchange some money for it.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.440
Like that just seems to me

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.800
a much more rewarding thing to do

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.300
than book another week of consulting.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:16.620
Yeah.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.320
And I also think

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.180
offering consulting

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.820
on top of an open source project

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.680
that you also have,

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.740
I think there's actually

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.820
a very weird,

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.900
the incentives are very,

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.940
very misaligned on this

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.420
because you are making money

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.480
of people needing help

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.140
with your software.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.180
So don't make it too easy.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.360
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.000
So if you make it,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.760
like we've always wanted

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.480
to have great docs,

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.540
wanted it to be easy

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.560
for people to use spaCy.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.880
So if it's too easy

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.480
to use spaCy,

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.520
people don't need our services

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.560
and we make less money.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.120
But if spaCy is shit,

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.200
we're losing business that way

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.140
because people are not

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.860
coming to us anymore

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.360
and the library loses adoption.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.080
So I think it's,

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.680
there's a very weird...

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.580
Yeah, they are a little

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.220
misaligned,

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.400
the incentives there.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:50.740
Yeah.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.020
Yeah.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.620
So that's also why we think,

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.760
we think there's a great business

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.660
in this for other people

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.180
and actually,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:55.500
in fact,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.420
there are lots of consultants

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.200
who are somewhat specializing

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.540
on building stuff with spaCy

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.020
and it works well for them

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.620
and we think that's much better

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.200
for us

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.620
than if we did all of that.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.100
you talk about bucking the startup playbook

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:07.680
and, you know,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.980
like going against it,

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.940
some of these common misconceptions.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:11.660
In your talk,

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.780
you had four main misconceptions.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.080
I think they were really spot on

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:16.960
and super interesting.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.320
So let's talk about those a little bit.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.500
The first one was

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.880
you have to lose money

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.300
in the early days

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.020
and the early days

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.360
could be six months,

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.420
they could be 10 years.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:27.740
I mean,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.040
there are big companies

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.100
that are still losing money,

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.780
not making money.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:32.340
Yes,

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.680
it is incredible, right?

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.420
And, you know,

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.200
maybe that makes sense

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.240
and you actually talked about

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.960
when it does make sense,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.300
but a lot of times it doesn't

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.120
and, you know,

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.760
so let's just start there.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.320
Do you have to lose money right away

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.720
for a long time

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.180
until you've got enough growth?

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.000
In some industries,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.640
in some areas,

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.800
that might be the case.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.540
So I'm not saying,

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:49.800
oh,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.060
running at a loss is always bad.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.140
There's a legitimate like reason why,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:53.720
okay,

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.600
you might have very high startup costs.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.640
You can't expect,

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.540
for example,

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.460
any social app

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.500
in that sense

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.400
or anything

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.460
that really

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.720
can only make money

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.660
once you have users

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.800
falls into that category

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.600
because you need to grow.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:05.840
Yeah,

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.940
like a two-sided marketplace

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.680
like Airbnb

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.720
or Uber

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.800
or Lyft

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.760
or something like that,

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:11.940
right?

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.860
Or anything that has

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.320
like a physical product.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.420
Like I think in my talk,

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.960
I had like this mattress business

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.240
where,

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:17.440
okay,

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.400
you need to build something.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:18.940
Casper,

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:19.160
yeah,

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.560
and then you need to sell that.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.460
And,

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:21.980
okay,

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.180
so you need some cash up for it.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:23.700
That's fine.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.040
But for a lot of digital things,

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.100
that's actually not the case.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:27.620
And you can,

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.300
especially if you have a product

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.920
that you want to sell,

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.200
there is definitely an advantage

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.440
in selling that straight away

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.100
rather than running at a loss

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.500
even though you have something valuable

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.580
that people would be paying for.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.540
I totally agree with this.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.800
And I feel like,

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.760
especially in the digital world

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.700
where it's software

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.820
or something along those lines,

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.780
you can work your way into it,

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.060
right?

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.060
You don't have to say,

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.640
we're just going to quit our job

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.500
and start writing

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.340
the first line of code.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.220
You can start working on this

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.020
for an hour a day.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:54.780
You can start testing.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.220
You can see,

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:55.420
like,

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.240
is this something I built

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.720
that seems like it's going to be successful?

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.700
And then slowly

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.300
sort of transition to it,

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:00.480
right?

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.760
Which also helps you

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.540
have enough traction

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.740
when you're started

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.760
that it's like

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.940
sort of covering some of the bills.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:07.220
Yeah.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:07.520
And also,

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.620
I think this whole idea of,

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:08.820
okay,

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.640
running at a loss,

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.760
it's still kind of inspired

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.180
by much more traditional manufacturing

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.760
where actually

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.600
things become cheaper at scale.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.840
So you need to reach that scale.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.760
Like if you're building,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.700
if you have a manufacturing plant,

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.140
yes,

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.340
if you're building one car,

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.540
that's going to be much more expensive

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.200
than if you build

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.120
100,000 cars

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.480
or 100 million cars.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.420
But that's usually

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.640
not actually the case

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.200
with software development

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.240
because that's actually

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.240
more expensive at scale.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.020
So this whole concept

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:35.840
all falls apart

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.060
if you're actually applying that

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.140
to digital

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.080
or fully digital

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:39.940
digital products

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.040
and tools.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.440
This portion of Talk Python To Me

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.800
is brought to you by Linode.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.280
Are you looking for hosting

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:47.920
that's fast,

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.400
simple,

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.540
and incredibly affordable?

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.220
Well,

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.400
look past that bookstore

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.400
and check out Linode

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.760
at talkpython.fm

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.640
slash Linode.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.520
That's L-I-N-O-D-E.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.700
Plans start at just $5 a month

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.900
for a dedicated server

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.960
with a gig of RAM.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.320
They have 10 data centers

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.160
across the globe.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.400
So no matter where you are

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.520
or where your users are,

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.000
there's a data center for you.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.980
Whether you want to run

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.840
a Python web app,

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.120
host a private Git server,

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.480
or just a file server,

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.120
you'll get native SSDs

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.000
on all the machines,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
a newly upgraded

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.700
200 gigabit network,

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.660
24-7 friendly support

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.460
even on holidays,

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.520
and a seven-day

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.380
money-back guarantee.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.380
Need a little help

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.040
with your infrastructure?

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.380
They even offer

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.420
professional services

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.160
to help you with

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:26.660
architecture,

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.300
migrations,

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:27.780
and more.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.800
Do you want a dedicated

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.700
server for free

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.720
for the next four months?

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.620
Just visit

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.820
talkpython.fm

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.800
slash Linode.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.740
We brought that up

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.140
in your talk

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.940
and it was so interesting

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.200
because you're right,

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.940
things do get harder

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.960
in software

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.660
as the software

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.140
gets bigger,

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:42.940
whereas they get

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.120
maybe harder

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.500
but much cheaper

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.580
in any form

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.420
of physical manufacturing

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.140
or something like,

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:49.360
right?

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:49.820
Yeah,

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.560
Elon Musk built

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.320
the Gigafactory

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.900
because he needed

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.720
to make batteries

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.560
at a larger scale

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.460
so they could be cheaper,

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:55.760
right?

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.580
These types of things,

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.000
like that.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.440
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.480
It's not like he's

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.480
making much money

00:21:59.480 --> 00:21:59.900
with that yet.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.200
I think they actually

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:02.860
said Tesla

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.700
was going to have

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.160
a profit.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.320
Either it just did

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:05.980
or it's just about,

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.520
but yeah,

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.560
that's the whole

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.020
big growth

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.900
sort of side

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:09.300
of the world

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:09.820
as well.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.800
Yeah,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.280
so the idea

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.120
that software

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:12.740
gets harder

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.200
to build

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.020
the more people

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.580
you try to throw

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:14.840
at it

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.680
is really interesting.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.040
I mean,

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:16.740
long ago

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:17.260
we had the whole

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.380
mythical man month

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.280
that you can't have

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.500
a hundred people

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.120
working ten times

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.740
faster than,

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.280
you know,

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.240
ten people,

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.020
that sort of thing,

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:25.180
right?

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.580
So it's just,

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.260
it doesn't always

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.120
take a huge team

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.220
to build these products

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:31.760
and, you know,

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.360
you talked about

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.180
some of the open source

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.480
projects and others

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.220
that were actually

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.040
built by pretty

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:36.780
small teams,

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.100
right?

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:37.820
there's not that

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.200
many people

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:38.940
behind spaCy

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.500
and that's super

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:39.920
successful.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.260
There's not that

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:41.900
many people

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.940
behind Flask,

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.700
right?

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.340
And that's super

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:44.760
successful.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.420
Like the people

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.020
involved in the

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.760
pallets project,

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.820
they run a bunch

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.260
of open source

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.040
projects and that's

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.800
like, you know,

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.320
count them on my

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:50.640
hands,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.740
number of people,

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:51.980
right?

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.320
Actually,

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:52.980
even if you look

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.080
at the large

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:54.460
companies,

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.080
if you look at

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.580
things that are

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.460
produced by Google

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.760
or open source

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.520
projects released

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.840
by other companies

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.900
of a very large

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.200
size,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.740
it doesn't mean

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.760
that all of Google

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.680
is working on

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.200
TensorFlow

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.120
or all of Google

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:05.780
is working on

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.400
some other project

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:06.900
they released.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.440
Or Facebook's

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.120
React is another

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:09.540
example.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.140
It's not like all

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.060
of Facebook is

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:11.460
working on.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.080
They actually have

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:12.820
a very, very small

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.820
core team as well

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.380
and it's a very

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.420
successful project

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.100
and I think that

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.020
also you need

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.740
maybe a single

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.360
author or very

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.620
few authors to

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.140
really give a

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.820
project the

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.020
direction it

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:22.280
needs.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:22.880
It's like,

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.360
yeah,

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.100
writing a novel

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.200
with 200 people,

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:25.780
that's like a

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.280
very fun art

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:26.660
project,

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.460
but, you know,

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.440
it's not going to

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.040
be like the most

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.480
amazing,

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.200
continuous novel

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:31.920
of all time.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:32.760
I think it's

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.060
the same.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:33.740
Yeah,

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.240
but which is why

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:34.820
I always found

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.860
contributors a very

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.700
weird metric to

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.680
look at open

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.380
source projects

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.380
and how big

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:40.940
or successful

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:41.420
they are.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:41.600
Yeah,

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.240
I guess even in

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:42.960
these big companies,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.220
the reason the

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:44.980
small team gets to

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:45.580
work on it is they

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.280
have enough extra

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:46.500
money,

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.060
they can just pay

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:47.960
them to work on

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.420
these projects,

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.020
but that doesn't

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:49.660
mean they put 100

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.420
people on,

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:50.800
like you say,

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.460
React or something,

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:51.720
right?

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.280
That doesn't make

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:52.520
sense.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:52.720
Yeah,

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.040
and it also

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:53.600
doesn't mean that

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.360
the project is

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.980
necessarily has like,

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.300
I don't know,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.140
more of a chance to

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.580
stay than a project

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.460
that's developed by a

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.020
small company.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:00.740
If anything,

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.000
it's much cheaper for

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.080
a company like Google

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:03.880
or easier to just

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.340
shelve some project

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:05.600
even.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:05.840
I mean,

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.580
look at all the

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.480
stuff Google's killed

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.260
that people love,

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.600
like Google Reader.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.440
I'm still bitter

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.640
about this to this

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:11.980
day.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.840
I'm bitter.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.880
Yeah,

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.880
it's been 10 years

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.500
and I still think

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.040
about this a lot.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.140
Still have a few

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:17.780
scars in that.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.200
Yeah,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.280
they're killing Inbox,

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.180
which I absolutely

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.580
love,

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.820
and it's gone in

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.580
two months.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:22.820
Yeah,

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.180
two months.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:23.680
So,

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.740
well,

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.480
you're right,

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.160
it doesn't mean it.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:26.460
Yeah,

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.180
so that's why

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:27.920
when people are like,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.160
oh,

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:28.980
but how do I know

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:29.660
that your project

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.320
is going to stay

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:30.700
around?

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:31.880
It's a weird way

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.800
of looking at it.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.940
It's a valid concern,

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:34.800
but just because

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.500
something is developed

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.180
by a very large

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.040
company doesn't mean

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.880
they're going to

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.520
keep it alive

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.700
for longer or

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.380
necessarily want to

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.180
invest more resources

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:41.580
into it.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:41.800
Yeah,

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.420
that's for sure.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.180
So,

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:43.840
one other thing

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.380
you touched on

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.160
about this kind of

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.000
running at a loss

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.100
side of things

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.880
is it's a little bit

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.860
of a winner-take-all

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.400
situation.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:50.720
Yeah.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.680
that means people

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.400
are pursuing

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.460
these sort of

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.620
big VC-funded,

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.280
they've got to be

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.160
really big projects,

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.940
and that leaves room

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.660
for a bunch of

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.120
small and medium-sized

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.920
success stories

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.800
that are just

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.700
a little too small

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.360
for, you know,

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.720
that big investment

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.180
or whatever,

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:05.420
right?

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:05.920
But it would be

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.460
really great

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.060
for many people.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.660
what we're talking

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.020
about there

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.560
as small

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.420
is still like

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.080
a very,

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.620
very significant

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.060
amount.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:11.420
Like,

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.140
you know,

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:12.600
in a lot of

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.100
these areas,

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:13.560
a few hundred

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.460
million would be

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:14.900
too small.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.880
And I think

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.260
for a lot of

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:16.460
people,

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.000
that's actually,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.900
that's a pretty

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.440
good business.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.360
Yeah,

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.000
I would think so.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.220
Yeah,

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:20.420
yeah,

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:20.860
and also there are

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.640
lots of these

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.400
types of businesses

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.020
where you can,

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:23.720
for example,

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.780
if 50% of your

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.600
revenue is profit,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.660
you have a much,

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.200
much higher

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.700
trajectory to actually,

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.200
if you grow

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.440
at a similar rate

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.220
organically,

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.380
you're actually much

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.200
better off than if

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.060
you're in a position

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.760
where you maybe have

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.420
the same revenue

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.520
but it's only like,

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.500
you have the same

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.840
profit but it's only

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.780
like 10% of your

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:40.880
revenue or 2%

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.440
of your revenue.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:41.780
Yeah.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.160
So,

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:42.440
yeah,

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.100
we've always seen it

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:43.240
like,

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:43.420
okay,

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.780
we don't have to be

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.280
the one provider

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.780
of developer tools

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.080
ever in the world.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:49.340
Right,

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.000
so basically,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.080
if you're not chasing

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:51.900
this tournament,

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.120
winner takes all,

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.440
I got the big VC

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.140
round and we're gonna,

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:55.720
you know,

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.680
Facebook's gonna crush

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.400
MySpace or,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:58.640
you know,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.600
whatever type of

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.620
story we're trying,

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.300
narrative we're trying

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:01.740
to tell here,

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.700
then it's not

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.680
necessary to,

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.860
run at a loss

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.460
because you can be

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.020
more organic,

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:08.820
you can work on the

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.400
products that people

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.520
really want and just

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.440
grow a little bit slower

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.560
but still totally good

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.660
for you and your

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.660
smaller set of people,

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:14.820
right?

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.220
Yeah,

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:15.360
well,

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:15.980
you can have a

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.360
competitor,

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.060
you can,

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:17.780
it's fine,

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.220
you don't have to

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.160
crush everything else.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.340
Exactly.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.620
Can't we all just get along?

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.580
Which is quite expensive,

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:22.900
yeah.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.140
Yeah,

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:23.740
that's for sure.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.840
The other one,

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.660
which we touched a little

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.080
bit on,

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.440
is that you need to hire

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.180
a lot of people.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:28.840
So,

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.220
you think that small teams

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.360
actually are a big

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:31.880
advantage here,

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.040
yeah?

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.800
I agree.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.280
In our case,

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:33.600
definitely.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.980
I mean,

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.420
we're actually working

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:36.940
with a few more

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.380
developers,

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.220
especially for

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.500
Prodigy Scale to get

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:39.980
that ready,

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.760
and some other

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.820
projects we've lined up.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:42.460
But yeah,

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.220
we're still very small

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.120
and the ideal company

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.500
we envision is also

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.440
very small.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.380
And for us,

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.180
it means that actually

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.020
we can really take

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.420
advantage of hiring

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.540
or working with people

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.680
or being people

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.620
who have,

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.060
yeah,

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:54.560
more,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.740
a bigger variety

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.640
of different skills

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.840
that we can use.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:58.680
like,

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.620
in my talk,

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.160
I call this

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160
like T-shaped skill,

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.120
they're tree-shaped

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:02.600
skills,

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.420
kind of,

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.100
you know,

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.480
based on this idea

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.220
of the T-shaped

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.280
skills,

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.140
like a T-shirt,

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.720
one foundation,

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.380
and like two other

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.340
skills you kind of have.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:13.560
Right,

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.660
so maybe just to try

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.640
to summarize that idea

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.540
of like the T-shaped

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.160
skill is like,

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.040
you have a bunch of

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.040
things you sort of know,

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.000
you're sort of competent,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.940
you can sort of create

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.820
a website in Python,

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.020
you can sort of,

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:23.260
you know,

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.620
work with CSVs or databases,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.040
but you're really good

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:26.380
in one,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.100
like the stem of the T

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.740
is you're really good

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.120
in one deep area.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.220
You're like a systems engineer,

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:32.820
that's the idea

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.480
of the T-shaped

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.540
and then I say,

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.000
actually,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.960
what's even better than that

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.700
and even more useful

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.320
in small business

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:38.680
is that,

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.040
is it,

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.500
are the tree-shaped skills.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.180
So you have,

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.160
you still have a base

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.980
but you have all these

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.740
different branches

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:45.760
and all these different

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.940
other skills that you have,

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.740
those can,

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.340
they can overlap

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.260
with other trees,

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.400
you can grow a new branch

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.500
which is kind of nice

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.140
because actually,

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:53.840
yeah,

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.340
a T-shirt

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.740
is really quite static.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.440
Just gets worn out over time,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:57.840
that's right.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.760
Yeah,

00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.360
but like a tree,

00:27:59.360 --> 00:27:59.720
you can,

00:27:59.720 --> 00:27:59.980
you know,

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:00.960
a tree is active,

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.720
a tree is growing

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.760
so I kind of like that

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.740
metaphor more.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:04.580
I like that metaphor

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.480
a whole lot too

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.340
because I think,

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.040
you know,

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.320
it's one thing to hire people

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.660
but you're never going to hire people

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.280
that have all the skills you need

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.380
but you know what,

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.080
they can learn it,

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.840
they can take an online class,

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.640
they could go and do

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.460
an in-person class,

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.380
they could get a book,

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.780
there's so many ways

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.720
to learn these days

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.280
that like you can sprout

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.000
these new skills

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.460
and I think that's a great analogy,

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.820
these tree-shaped skills.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.000
The types of people

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.280
who have these sort of

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.960
very versatile skills,

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.580
it's not really selected for

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.760
in a lot of larger teams

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.280
and,

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:33.860
you know,

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:34.180
more,

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:34.820
you know,

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.220
the more stereotypical software development

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.240
because in large companies,

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:37.720
it's,

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:37.980
you know,

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.580
it's fine,

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.220
it makes sense

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.640
why a large company

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.500
hires differently

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.420
than a small company

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.160
because you need people

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.680
to be a bit more interchangeable

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.060
and you need a very different

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:46.920
type of team

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.620
but if you're small,

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.580
you kind of don't have

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.560
those concerns

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.400
and so you can really,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:50.980
yeah,

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.860
it can really help you a lot

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.760
to have very different people,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.960
very different backgrounds

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.160
and that's kind of

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:56.600
what we're doing.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.620
So another analogy

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:58.820
that I really like about this

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.780
is this tree

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.620
and this idea of like

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.500
growing new skills.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.080
To be successful

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.920
as a software developer,

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.820
especially in smaller companies,

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.420
you have to be always willing

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.980
to be learning new things,

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:10.360
right?

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.420
It's not enough to like,

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:11.560
well,

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.080
I went to school

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.340
and I got my computer science degree

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.460
so now I'm just going to go

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.600
do that,

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.300
right?

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.900
like you're continuously learning

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.080
and this tree analogy

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.600
and adding new skills,

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.800
I think it embraces

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.080
like the best type

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:23.980
of software developers

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.960
anyway

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.220
because they're constantly learning.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:26.400
No,

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:26.960
I agree with that.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.640
So another thing

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.340
that you said

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.400
was you don't have

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.040
to be sneaky

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:30.920
and I feel like

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.740
that comes back

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.460
to this kind of

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.040
data is the new oil,

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.220
what we need our users

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.380
so we can take their data

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.620
and somehow make money on it

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.560
and maybe we're going to do

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.520
something a little shady

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.400
so we've got to be

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.360
a little sneaky about that.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.320
What did you mean there?

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.300
I also had this point

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:43.740
like you don't

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:44.960
the true value lies

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.340
in your users' data

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.380
which is basically

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.080
the same idea

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:48.900
that you're kind of

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.120
you're trying to trick people

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.880
into using your product

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.960
but actually your incentives

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.480
are very different

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.480
or you're trying to monetize

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.220
something that you don't

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:57.740
already have

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.300
you're trying to

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.120
you're monetizing

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.480
some future promise

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.260
that you've made

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.540
which will actually

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.640
offer you those returns

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.600
that you have to

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.340
come up with

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.740
because just making a profit

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:07.340
isn't enough

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.660
so you actually end up

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.200
often all

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.420
I've definitely seen

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.480
like a lot of products

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.440
on companies

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.020
that have

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.260
made in my opinion

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.000
bad product decisions

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.460
in order to kind of

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.900
satisfy those types

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.420
of promises

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.140
Yeah promises to investors

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.240
right not promises

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:22.880
to the users

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.200
and actually it's not even

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.340
just that you have

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.300
all the evil investors

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.480
you actually you set up

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.660
you go for a business model

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.200
where okay

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.960
you get a lot of money

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.920
up front and that's great

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.780
and you can work with that

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.000
but also for yourself

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.580
you need to turn it

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.440
into a certain type

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:35.880
of company

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.800
in order to make it

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.520
worthwhile

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.660
and to also get some

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.140
money out of it

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:40.560
for yourself

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.020
so it's just that

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:42.420
okay that

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.600
that thing you agreed on

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.140
and that dynamic

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.040
and that works for some

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.420
types of products

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.240
and for others

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.200
it really doesn't

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:48.920
Yeah absolutely

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.040
machine learning

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:50.760
that's processing

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.480
sensitive private data

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.440
probably not so much

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.280
sneaky is probably

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.000
not a good option

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.820
no and also you do want

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:57.920
I think trust is very

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:58.840
important and actually

00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.600
genuine trust

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.320
like if your users

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.800
think you're a decent

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.820
person that's like

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.020
that's worth a lot

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.140
and that's also something

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:05.860
you don't want to

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.920
play with

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.300
and that's

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.760
you know it's a scary

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.580
thing to do and say

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.400
okay look I'm

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.780
ready to really take

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.500
full responsibility

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.380
and I want to

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.220
you know we say

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:14.880
well we want to be

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.400
held accountable

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.800
for the things we do

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.800
like it'd be much

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.460
easier to just

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.440
not do that

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.060
and set those

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:21.600
expectations

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.220
That's right

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.820
so another thing

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.700
that's big in the

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.360
startup world

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.620
is that you have to

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.500
not just test things

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.160
or try them

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.660
but you have to

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.460
A-B test them

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:32.800
you have to

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.560
every time you send

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.260
an email there needs

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.000
to be a couple of

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.380
variations

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.080
every time you have

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.040
a page that talks

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.540
about your product

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.100
you need to have

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.140
three versions that

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:39.980
sell it in different

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.960
ways and so on

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.120
and that can just

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.280
be overwhelming

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.720
to a lot of people

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.220
they're like do I

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.920
really need to do

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.460
all this stuff

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.040
to get started

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.000
I don't know

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.720
it just it seems

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.600
a little over the top

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.640
and one of your

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.040
beliefs is that

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.320
you can make good

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.040
decisions without

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.040
testing all the

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:57.400
assumptions

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:57.880
yeah

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.480
you can

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.620
you don't have to

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.240
test everything

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:00.540
right

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.260
that's true

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:01.780
and also because

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.320
I think the

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.180
underlying idea

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:03.620
there is that

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.380
you can't just

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.500
replace logic

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.000
and reasoning

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.620
about things

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.500
with pure data

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.060
you've collected

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:08.960
because there's

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.600
always you know

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.360
it's always biased

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:10.980
in some way

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.100
and that's just

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:12.740
not possible

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.520
and the thing is

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.300
the reality is

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:14.780
if you're running

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:15.220
a business

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.180
you need to make

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:16.780
a lot of decisions

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.460
and you need to

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.220
make you need to

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:18.640
be right

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.280
that's sort of

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.100
the secret

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:20.800
you need to make

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.480
the right decisions

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.260
and make them

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.100
many times in a

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:23.340
row

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.340
you know you can

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:24.820
do a lot of

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.400
things to make

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.240
this easier for

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.140
you and make it

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:27.740
easier for you to

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.140
make the right

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:28.720
decisions but

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.860
ultimately you need

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:30.320
to be able to

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.860
reason about things

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.920
and reason about it

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.780
in a way that

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.960
leads to the

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.580
outcome that you

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.620
want and that's

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.180
something you can't

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.780
just compensate for

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.320
by trying things

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.660
until you maybe

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.420
find something that

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.540
works and then

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.660
going back looking

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.200
at what you've

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:45.900
tested there and

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:46.680
drawing the conclusion

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.340
and how this

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:47.940
must have been

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.520
why this worked

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:49.880
and the other

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.340
thing didn't

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:50.840
yeah and so

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.500
many times I

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.260
think those

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.640
experiments especially

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.780
around price or

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:55.720
offers can feel

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.960
really crummy to

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.840
the your best

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.520
people the people

00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.360
who buy stuff

00:32:59.360 --> 00:32:59.760
from you and

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.820
support you I'm

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.500
thinking of things

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.860
like Udemy the

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.160
online course place

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.720
where if you go

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.320
there they say the

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:06.940
price of this course

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:07.800
is 200 bucks

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.380
but you know what

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:09.940
if you don't

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.720
actually buy it but

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.300
you're logged in

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:11.980
you'll get an email

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:12.740
saying oh it's

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.140
actually on sale for

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:14.780
just one week

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.460
it's $15 or

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.260
something right like

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.600
it's 5% of the

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.720
price or whatever a

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.500
little bit later and

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.040
then you come back

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:22.500
and there's some

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.500
other sale it ends

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.140
tonight oh wait

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.060
tomorrow the sale is

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:25.720
on these are just

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.540
all these shady

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.140
things and just my

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.400
feeling of companies

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.440
like that I just

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.180
like oh man like

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.580
either just sell me

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.440
what you think the

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.100
value of the thing

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.220
is or I don't

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:37.740
know just don't

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.420
don't try to like

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.780
continuously show me

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.980
tricky stuff until I

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.840
you know bite on

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.480
something right it

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.320
just feels like

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.120
dishonest somehow

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.220
we as developers are

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:46.920
maybe also a bit

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.780
more a bit less like

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.020
oblivious there like

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.740
you know we spot

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.520
bullshit and we don't

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.120
want to be like

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.880
bullshit I'm not

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.560
saying this is like

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.400
something unique to

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.140
developers but I

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.640
think you look at

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.280
these things and you

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:57.920
don't want someone to

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.100
tell you like oh this

00:33:59.100 --> 00:33:59.860
is magically going to

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:00.240
solve all your

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:00.920
problems you want

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.580
someone to tell you

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.760
oh you developing

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.540
something here's

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.020
something that can

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.760
help you and here's

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.480
how this works and

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.420
here's how much this

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.360
costs and you're like

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.700
all right or you're

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.420
like maybe not so

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.440
we've definitely we've

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.500
definitely seen seen

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.120
this as something

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:13.700
that's like

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.400
important for us and

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.200
just because you're

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.040
a b testing something

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.860
it doesn't always

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:18.420
mean you know you

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.040
still need to reason

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.320
about stuff like if

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.160
you just automatically

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:21.860
you test every

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.660
possible combination

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:23.300
and you might end

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.460
up with the

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.200
conclusion that

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.080
scamming people is

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:26.760
actually the most

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.680
lucrative way of

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.520
making money at

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.100
least in the short

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:30.760
term right but it

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.480
goes back to this

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.740
trust thing as well

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.260
yeah in the short

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:33.860
term maybe even in

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.560
the long term like

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.340
there are people who've

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.000
been scamming for

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.660
all their lives and

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.460
they've been doing

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.200
pretty well at that

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:38.920
so you know you can

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.940
optimize for that but

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:40.800
like is that really the

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.340
thing you want to be

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:42.660
doing probably not

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.720
or if it is I

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.240
thought about like

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:44.960
mentioning this up

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.860
front in my talk like

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.340
I'm going to be

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.480
talking about ethical

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.960
and legal ways of

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.920
running a business if

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.860
that's not what you

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.680
have to know start

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.100
some like initial

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.420
coin offering stuff

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.600
and leave now like

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.940
because it's the other

00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.100
rules like sure if

00:34:59.100 --> 00:34:59.540
you don't want it to

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.560
be legal or ethical

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.060
like yeah none of

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:02.860
this there's a lot of

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.100
options but who cares

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:04.760
right that's that's

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.060
not what you're about

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.880
interesting and you

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.260
also talked about some

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.160
of this a b testing

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.020
stuff is sort of

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:12.640
driven by this

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.280
tournament winner

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.180
takes all mentality

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:14.760
because if you're

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.420
competing against

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.560
another company and

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.200
your belief is they're

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:19.960
going to crush us or

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.680
we have to crush them

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.440
there's no way we can

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.920
both coexist then you're

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.740
always looking for that

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.700
little edge right

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.860
that's true and also

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.860
or you look at like I

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:27.440
think another thing

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.140
that's that's also very

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.060
popular is looking at

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.180
others in this who

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:30.700
were in the same

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.720
tournament and didn't

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.100
make it so you look at

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.100
some other company that

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:34.960
was there before and

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:35.880
they failed and then

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.960
you try to analyze that

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.920
and maybe even talk

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.060
to them why did you

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:39.940
fail and they will

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.160
tell you well we

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.040
should have done x

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.160
because we didn't do

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.240
x and that's why we

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.420
failed and so you're

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.340
like well and that's

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.080
how that's actually

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:47.960
where I think a lot of

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.980
this advice comes from

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.480
and it doesn't actually

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.320
make much sense because

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.300
it's it's not really

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.060
um yeah we're not that

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.160
good at really analyze

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.740
and at analyzing why

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.840
something didn't happen

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.640
and just because you

00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.860
didn't do x and fail

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:00.880
doesn't mean that if

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.400
you had done x you

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.040
wouldn't have failed

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.800
yeah I mean if you

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.100
actually knew exactly

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.300
why it failed you

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:06.980
probably could just

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.720
address it and make

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.620
it not fail yeah

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.840
probably right like

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.680
well this is the

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.600
problem let's just not

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.860
do that I mean not

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.000
always but uh it's

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.020
still interesting and

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.800
then the last

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.220
misconception you talk

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:17.980
about is that the

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.020
true value of your

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.520
software company product

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.840
whatever lies in your

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.260
users data yeah

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.520
because I mean we

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.140
really I think we

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:26.680
talked about this

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.020
briefly earlier we

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:28.600
yeah we definitely

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.740
covered this yeah yeah

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:30.700
and I think it's clear

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.540
where this comes from

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.600
this was definitely

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.520
driven by this idea

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.660
that all data is so

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.540
valuable and people

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.340
talk about this and

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:36.800
I think it's never

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.520
even really clear

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.660
what they mean by

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:39.640
data do they mean

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.040
your personal data

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.560
because maybe that's

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.540
valuable if you're in

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.620
a certain position

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.400
like if I want to

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.040
sell you stuff

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.100
knowing who you are

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:47.720
where you live what

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.680
you like is valuable

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.420
if I don't for me

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.000
personally your Amazon

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
buying history wouldn't

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.200
be very valuable if I

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:55.680
were in a different

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.580
business maybe it

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.900
would so it's not

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.480
always very even

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.300
very clear what people

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.100
mean with data but

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:00.860
what people have

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.120
concluded is that we

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:02.900
need to harvest as

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:03.780
much as possible as

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.460
quickly as possible

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.680
whatever we can might

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.380
be worth something

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.320
and I think now we're

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:07.820
getting to a point

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:08.280
where people are

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.920
sitting on all of

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.680
this and are

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.680
realizing that actually

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.500
it's not even

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.280
necessarily that useful

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.660
and they're very now

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:15.340
we're at a point where

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.440
companies are really

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.880
struggling to make

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.780
sense of all of that

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:19.680
data they've harvested

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.700
at like very high

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.900
costs in terms of

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:22.760
user experience and

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.860
trust I agree and I

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.800
also think it's only

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.920
valuable to the very

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.500
large companies right

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.420
like it's valuable to

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.620
Facebook it's valuable

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.260
to Google but if you

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.560
were a three person

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.740
software company that

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.480
had 5,000 really

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.060
committed users that

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.360
were could otherwise

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.140
pay you right there's

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:39.880
no way that those

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.880
5,000 people's buying

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.100
history or whatever is

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.460
worth anywhere near just

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:45.340
like their trust and

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.260
like hey I'm gonna make

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.500
something for you I

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.360
think it's valuable I

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:48.960
think you'll want it

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.680
they agree you give

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.640
them something that

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.280
they give you money

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.140
back right like that's

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.360
just a much better and

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.420
easier story I think

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:58.620
this portion of talk

00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.300
Python to me is

00:37:59.300 --> 00:37:59.940
brought to you by

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.440
rollbar got a

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.520
question for you have

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.300
you been outsourcing

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.260
your bug discovery to

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.460
your users have you

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.400
been making them send

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.060
you bug reports you

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:08.500
know there's two

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.500
problems with that you

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.420
can't discover all the

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.900
bugs this way and some

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:12.620
users don't bother

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.600
reporting bugs at all

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.080
they just leave sometimes

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.680
forever the best

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.760
software teams practice

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.820
proactive error

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.060
monitoring they detect

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.140
all the errors in their

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:21.900
production apps and

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.260
services in real time

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.240
and debug important

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.320
errors in minutes or

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.620
hours sometimes before

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.700
users even notice

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.060
teams from companies

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.640
like Twilio Instacart and

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.420
Circle CI use rollbar to

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.380
do this with rollbar you

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.080
get a real-time feed of

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.220
all the errors so you

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.080
know exactly what's

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.400
broken in production and

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.700
rollbar automatically

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.580
collects all the

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.540
relevant data and

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.860
metadata you need to

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.000
debug the errors so you

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.560
don't have to sift

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.520
through logs if you

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.220
aren't using rollbar

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.360
yet they have a special

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.480
offer for you and it's

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.100
really awesome sign up

women who code

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.460
organization get notified

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.740

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:09.680
and make a difference in

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.000
open source visit talk

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.640
python.fm slash rollbar

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.140
today

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:16.640
we can do that we can

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.780
just we can sell

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:18.720
products and not

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.960
promises and that's

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.120
that's very nice and

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.220
that also makes that

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:22.940
also means we can

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.860
really make product

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.900
decisions around

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:25.920
actually providing that

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.820
value that people want

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:27.880
without having to

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.800
engineer our personal

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.580
objectives hidden or

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.480
hidden objectives into

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.560
that somehow yeah

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:34.540
yeah it comes back to

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.360
kind of the start of

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.300
this whole conversation

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.060
right like sell

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.660
products not don't be

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.720
sneaky all those kinds

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.520
of things right yeah

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.160
and also I think in

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:43.720
machine learning

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.640
especially people have

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.520
this idea that oh

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.960
maybe the users okay

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.860
our users are using

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.960
prodigy to label their

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.180
data and there and

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.500
that's because it's

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.140
you know seen as such

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.580
a tedious process you

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.320
know maybe we could

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.420
people have told us

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.180
like oh you're sitting

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.380
on this gold mine if

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.000
you just harvested

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.860
everything people ever

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.240
labeled with your tool

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.500
you could then use that

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.420
and train one machine

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.340
machine learning model

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.240
that knows everything

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.680
but this is actually

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.020
very far from how

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:07.760
machine learning works

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.520
in practice it's also

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.740
the really the true

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.120
value is in creating

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:12.960
very very specific

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.020
systems that are very

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:14.800
specific to your

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.460
problem so anything you

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.700
label might not

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.620
necessarily be useful

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.300
to me also this

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.380
process is very very

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.960
experimental so I

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.640
have no idea of

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.460
knowing which one of

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.840
your 200 data sets is

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.080
actually the one that

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.020
worked for you and

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.980
even if I do I know

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:30.780
it worked for whatever

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.860
problem you were

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.660
trying to solve there's

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.140
no machine learning

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.000
model to rule them

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.320
all also we've built

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.260
an annotation tool we

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.700
believe our annotation

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.900
tool is one of the

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:40.680
most efficient out

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.640
there so if we wanted

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.000
to label some data

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.380
and train a model we

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.240
would just do that

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.520
ourselves right just

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.140
go to mechanical

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.760
turk yeah well

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.380
yeah I'll just I

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.100
mean prodigy is very

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.660
optimized for having

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.440
people work very fast

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.200
having people you can

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.220
hire doing it yourself

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.040
so you don't even need

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:56.900
any human labor

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.240
platform because that

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.940
also comes with a lot

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.420
of problems so I could

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.700
sit there spend a day

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.840
and I could be very

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.460
very productive run

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.560
lots of experiments and

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.900
end up with a model

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.760
that well at least

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.620
knowing whether my

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.620
model can learn what I

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.040
wanted to learn and

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.140
that's very powerful and

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:14.860
so if we wanted to do

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.060
that there's no need to

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:16.860
just take this from our

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.740
users we can just do

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.480
it you've built the

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.000
tool that they get to

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.900
use to really solve

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.520
their problem you could

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.100
just do that for

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.180
yourself it makes a lot

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.320
of sense I think I

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:25.960
don't know there's

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.520
there's a whole lot of

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.920
interesting ways we

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.140
could talk about AI and

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:29.940
machine learning and

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.500
stuff where do you see

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.760
AI going do you see it

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.500
being these super

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.920
specialized things do

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.120
you see there being one

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.320
AI to rule them all

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.040
like what are your

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.240
thoughts here I think

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.100
the one AI to rule

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:40.740
them all that's like

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.320
maybe something you

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:41.980
can come up with if

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.060
you yeah follow some of

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:43.940
the media coverage but

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:44.440
like I don't think

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.340
it's very very

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.020
realistic and very

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.040
close to what people

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.000
are actually building I

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:48.700
think what we're seeing

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.860
is all across

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.060
industries whatever

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.420
people are doing they

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.660
want more insights they

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.760
want to optimize their

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.900
existing processes and

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.300
they want systems that

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.720
specialize very well to

00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.660
exactly what they are

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.300
trying to do and it

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.340
becomes more of a tool

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:03.160
right so the more

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.580
specialized it is yeah

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.660
and they can use machine

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.160
learning as a tool to

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:07.920
achieve that and of

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.240
course there are

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.240
realistic concerns that

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.180
we do have to think

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.640
about in for example

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.200
what's going to

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.340
happen with people

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.060
being replaced how or

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:15.780
how are companies

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.780
dealing with this in

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.520
maybe ways that are

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.200
actually very harmful

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.700
also because of kind of

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.980
a wrong idea of what

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.620
the technology can

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.060
really do their ethical

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.140
concerns their concerns

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.780
about bias and just you

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.540
know just because we

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.380
build some system

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.740
doesn't mean that it's

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:31.500
like perfect and you

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.480
know we still build it

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.020
so we're gonna all the

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:34.900
mistakes we make we're

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:35.680
just going to encode in

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.940
that system all the

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:37.660
bias and all the

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:38.620
problems we have we're

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.320
going to just encode in

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.140
that system and cool

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.420
then it can you know if

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:42.340
you make bad

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.480
decisions cool you can

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.440
train a model to make

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.420
those bad decisions for

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.040
you it doesn't mean that

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.900
things are necessarily

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.300
better so these are

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.040
all things we have to

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.680
talk about ultimately I

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.280
think still machine

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.700
learning is a tool at

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.120
this point and yeah I

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.040
tend to agree I am a

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.720
little concerned about

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.960
the automation and jobs

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.040
and then the effect that

00:42:59.040 --> 00:42:59.980
will have on on

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.380
politics and society but

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.580
but in general I'm

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.620
pretty upbeat on these

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.800
things I guess let me

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.920
ask you a couple of

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.760
sort of meta questions

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.140
around around this to

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.060
close out this okay

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.260
first of all it seems

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:13.840
like you're having a

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:14.440
lot of fun are you

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.300
having fun running your

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.440
own company you and

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.560
Matt yes definitely I

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.220
would say it's the best

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.820
job I've had so far

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.700
yeah that's cool I

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.500
thrilled doing what I'm

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.260
doing I'm basically

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.600
broken like I cannot go

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.400
back to a regular

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.040
corporate job I don't

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.800
know about you but I

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.560
think it really depends

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.480
like I feel like one

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.280
thing I hate is like

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.220
this mentality that a

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:31.840
lot of self-employed

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.660
people have where they're

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.460
like essentially looking

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:34.620
down on people who are

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.800
like in regular jobs I

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.740
read this a lot and I'm

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.700
like no there's so many

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.120
valid reasons why you

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.940
would want to have a

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.000
regular job working for

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:43.800
someone else and that

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.560
makes people happy but on

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.520
the other hand I do think

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.120
yeah in general and as a

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.000
society we should make it

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.500
easier for people who want

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:51.160
to start their own

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.260
businesses to start their

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.860
own businesses and then

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:54.700
make it easier for those

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.600
businesses to actually

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.720
create sustainable jobs

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.940
that then other people can

00:43:58.940 --> 00:43:59.780
take right we were just

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:00.880
talking about AI taking

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.040
away people's jobs but if

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.020
there can be other

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.240
businesses so they don't

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.180
lose their job they just do

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.240
a different job that's

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.240
also meaningful to them

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:07.920
that's a much better

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.740
option right also

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:09.960
businesses that can pay

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:10.920
their employees out of

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.320
profits they make because

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.560
that's ultimately also very

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.440
sustainable because that

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.480
means the money is there

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.940
right and rather than say

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.520
stock options that are kind

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.220
of promises down the line

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.060
in the future yeah yeah

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.620
exactly and also already I

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:23.940
mean in order to like a lot

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.760
of these offerings in order

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.880
to exercise them you already

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.220
need such a privilege that you

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.880
can afford this and if you

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.540
cannot you know this is

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:31.320
expensive if you're already

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.320
pretty privileged enough

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.660
fine but like if you're not

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.740
none of this is going to

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.780
help you very much I

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.580
totally agree that's a

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.040
great point then another

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.180
question someone asked at

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.220
the end of your talk which

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.000
I thought was maybe worth

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.060
mentioning is you know you

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.100
hear people talk about I

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.020
think this also comes from

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:47.820
some of the VC back

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.800
companies is talk about

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.200
work-life balance and just

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.540
giving up everything to work

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.420
super super hard and maybe

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.380
they're really successful in

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.480
business but maybe not so

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.080
much in life right with

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.160
relationships and whatnot

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.460
how's that for you I'm

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.420
definitely very much against

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.800
this kind of school of like

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.160
entrepreneurship where all

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.340
you need to you know only

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.960
the hardest workers can

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.200
succeed and you need to run

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.600
on four hours of sleep and

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.140
like I don't know this is

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.000
definitely something we try

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.820
to like optimize in the way

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.120
we run our company that like

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.300
you know we we're not

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.640
measuring success by like

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.620
how how low can you go on

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.120
sleep and how hard can you

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.080
work because I also think

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.260
you can always work you can

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.660
work smarter instead of

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.740
harder there's a certain

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.020
privilege of course that

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.220
comes with you know we I

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:31.040
can choose where I want to

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.080
work I can choose to

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.300
structure my life in a

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.620
certain way I feel like this

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.420
is important to point out

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:36.540
because not everyone's able

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.880
to do that but in general I

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.160
do think we can you know in

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.380
a way if you if you're not in

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.440
the competition you can

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.300
optimize for living in a

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.900
place that's affordable you

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.960
can optimize for okay you

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.920
want to have more time or you

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.640
want to work in a certain way

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.440
now while you're younger so

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.120
you can maybe work less when

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.440
you're older those are all

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.500
important considerations

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.740
yeah absolutely like for

00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.580
example you talked about

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.040
living in Berlin where life is

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.180
fairly reasonable as opposed

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.200
to you know eight

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.120
thousand dollars for an

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.320
apartment in San Francisco or

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.480
something completely off the

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.700
charts right and we're lucky

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.680
that we don't have to be in

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.180
one of the tech hubs we can

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.080
be on the internet but I

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:13.960
don't I'm always trying to

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:14.740
when talking about these

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.100
topics especially work life

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.500
balance I'm always trying to

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.460
be careful not to come

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.380
across as like yay start your

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.460
own business it's all great

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.720
like oh I can but also not

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:24.600
going the other road and

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.980
saying yes you know yeah you

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.120
have to be prepared to work

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.020
like super hard and you're

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.160
on call all day and it's

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.400
like there are valid

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.720
concerns on both sides and I

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.640
don't want to over

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.260
romanticize either of and but

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.420
I do think it's possible to

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.100
optimize for something that

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.860
works for your living

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.060
situation yes yeah you don't

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.080
have to completely kill

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.480
yourself to make it work in

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.900
your specific situation right

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:46.840
like you and Matt are having

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.360
a have a good time not always

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.020
working always burned out if I

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.020
could keep it that way that's

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.020
a very good objective for me

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.420
yes one of the really nice

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.580
trade-offs when that person

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.760
asked that question I thought

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.240
well yeah it's a little more

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.700
stressful you've got to keep

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.700
the business running there's

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:02.820
more stuff on your shoulders

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.040
but also you have more

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.240
flexibility because you're

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.680
trading value for money not

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.500
time for money so if something

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.360
comes up in your life you're

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.360
like the next three days I kind

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.540
of want to do this like you

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.600
just do it and then maybe you

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.580
work on the weekend to make

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:17.960
up for it or like I think

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.380
there's more fluidity and

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.580
freedom to find that work-life

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:22.560
balance if you're after it

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.880
yeah and also this idea of I

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.080
mean what's often referred to

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.400
as passive income even though I

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.620
find this I don't know I find

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.300
this term a bit weird I do

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:30.200
find it weird as well because

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.240
you typically have to work

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.020
super hard to get that passive

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.060
income it doesn't it's not

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.300
really passive yeah it's also

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.440
because it's this fantasy like

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.860
of course everyone wants to like

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.580
sit at the beach while making

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.880
tons of money and that's why

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.540
this has also been abused a lot

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.680
in like I don't know life

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.100
advice and you if you google

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.360
passive income I'm sure the top

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.520
results are all from some scammy

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.720
life advice buy this e-book where

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.960
I'm going to tell you how to make

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.860
passive income and the advice in

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.120
that e-book is write an e-book

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.660
promising others passive income

00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.720
and it's like that kind of

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.860
pyramid scheme so that's why I

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:03.840
like hate this term but it's

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.260
obviously in general optimizing for

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.480
a situation where for example you

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.220
build something once that has value

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.500
that people like you optimize for a

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.640
business where people genuinely like

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.400
buying your software and are happy

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.680
with your software and you'll have

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.240
one software one piece of software

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.840
that you can just sell to lots of

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:20.980
people who are all happy with that

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.720
that's a good way of doing it

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.600
because you know this means you can

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.780
build something once and maintain

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.440
it once and sell it a lot to people

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.640
there's a lot to be said for that

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.940
path absolutely so I guess maybe we

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:33.140
could close out our conversation

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.600
around this building a software

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.040
business maybe bucking the startup

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.280
trends with just some advice you

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.440
might have for people so if there are

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.040
people out there maybe they have an

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.300
open source project maybe they just

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.800
have an idea for something they want

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.700
to start what advice would you give

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:52.480
them about somehow making this their

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.940
job right starting some kind of

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.860
company that offers value to people

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:57.880
maybe they're doing consulting maybe

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.320
they're doing full-time work I don't

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.480
know yeah I mean it's a very loaded

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.060
question because it's it's tough I

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.440
know it's very specific to people's

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.520
situations but yeah definitely I think

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.280
what worked for us was definitely

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.680
okay you you know you want to offer

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.580
people something that they need and

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.920
if you're in a position where for

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.880
example you have an open source

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.020
project and you see that there's you

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:17.000
know genuinely something you're

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.880
solving for people that's a very good

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.280
start you know it is also very good

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.060
to actually you know you look at how

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.600
is it going are you making making

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.380
money with this and also have a plan

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.120
for okay when are you gonna stop

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.000
because I feel like the if you're

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.320
going the opposite route there's not

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.860
really never really an incentive for

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.480
is it working is it not working

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.820
because you can always optimize and

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.160
you're running at a loss anyways but

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.340
if you're actually running at a profit

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.780
you can use that profit to really see

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.600
okay you know this is where you're

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.500
going it doesn't lie it's very yeah in a

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.340
sense it is riskier because you know

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.020
there's no that's the only path like

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:52.820
always people are like oh you're going

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.940
you're doing the risk averse thing and

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.220
I'm like well it's not that risk

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:57.920
averse because you know we're actually

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.560
making a profit that is like that's

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.700
quite a risk because if you're not

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.860
making a profit that's it you know

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.400
like choosing not to make a profit is

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.000
actually a pretty risk averse it's a

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.680
little too open-ended maybe maybe I

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.920
mean it's it's like ultimately or

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.400
maybe ultimately like giving advice is

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.620
always difficult and ultimately the

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.380
advice would have to be make decisions

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.380
and be right about them that's

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.260
actually that would be the most honest

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.700
genuine advice but it's also often not

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.060
what's really that actionable yeah very

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.300
satisfying because the advice you know

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.760
you still need to do it and I but on the

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.620
other hand I kind of I also like this

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:33.140
sort of way of thinking about it because

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.140
it shows that okay at this and whatever

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:36.260
I'm going to tell someone is always

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.060
going to be kind of biased yeah it's

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.000
this idea okay you can like it is

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.680
possible to ship value and make money

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.780
from that it is possible to offer

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.600
something that people will pay for

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.440
because people like paying for things

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.060
it's not like nobody wants to pay for

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.220
stuff people do want to pay for stuff if

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.900
you can find a way to give them that

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.620
opportunity and I think also it is fine

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.240
if you can reason about things and

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.180
you're right it's fine to do that like

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.860
you shouldn't feel like you need all of

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.680
this data to back up whatever you thought

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.860
was right if you can actually make this

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.320
work it's fine like you don't have to

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.120
beat yourself up because you didn't

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.580
maybe test that assumption and

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.900
somebody's gonna ask you oh but how do

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.560
you know that like the sky is blue

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.160
it's like well I looked at the sky and

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.980
it's like it's blue my experience is

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.320
it's generally blue yeah yeah I mean

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.860
something it's real because I

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.380
experience it is also a pretty

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.460
problematic way of looking at things in

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:30.100
my opinion but like it's still there

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.400
are some things that you can know when

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.940
it's fine to like know things and act on

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.700
them especially if it like leads to a

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.540
good outcome yeah that sounds good I

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:40.580
guess take your best take your

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.080
understanding make your best decisions

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.900
you can and take action and then follow

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.600
that feedback loop right basically creates

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.060
a job for yourself where you can do all

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.780
the things you like and channel that into

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.980
a productive outcome that's commercially

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.140
viable because it took me a while to

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.940
kind of get there but often I do think

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:58.600
for most people they have things that

00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.820
they like doing that they're good at

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.260
that maybe are not so compatible in the

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.040
very stereotypical system of working and

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.800
typical jobs in tech that might actually

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.860
it might actually look very different

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.400
once you're in business for yourself and

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.720
you realize that oh actually this sort of

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.320
talent I have here or this thing I'm

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:17.040
really good at I can actually use this

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.040
productively in my own business this is

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.780
useful for people yeah absolutely yeah

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.420
that sounds great let's leave it there so

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.200
hopefully people got a lot out of that

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.740
conversation I'm sure that they will but

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.080
before I let you go we have to ask you the

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.820
two questions at the end of the show as

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.260
usual if you're going to write some

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.260
Python code what editor do you use visual

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.220
studio code like probably like most people

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.740
these days I'm not sure what's the most

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.660
popular I would say the Vim no I think

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.260
Visual Studio Code is probably the number

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.680
one most popular and you know PyTarm is

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.460
actually going pretty strong there and if

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.460
it's not one of those two it's usually

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:52.280
Vim or not even a max it's usually Vim yeah

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.420
I've tried probably most editors I'm also

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.980
very very open to trying new things if

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:58.660
they come out but I kind of I do think

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.220
Microsoft did like a really good job it's a

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.960
very it was it's a very impressive product

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.360
like I didn't expect that at first when I

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.840
started using it yeah I hear that a lot

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.340
and it's getting better all the time which

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:09.720
is pretty cool yeah and I'm actually very

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.980
excited about the Python integrations and

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.100
also the more like data science focused

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:16.040
stuff that I've been working on also I'd

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.960
always wanted like a spacey extension I

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.160
haven't I haven't had time to look into

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.520
this but like we have an open issue on the

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.200
tracker so if someone listens to this and

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.180
wants to work on this I'm super super

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.100
excited about that idea that sounds super

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:31.280
cool all right and then notable package on

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.460
pipey maybe not necessarily the most popular

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.980
but some of the people you're like oh

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:37.420
somebody they I found this and they should

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.840
know about it and I'll go ahead and throw

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.180
spacey out there for you already so we can

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.700
put spacey on the list right yeah of course

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.380
one idea I've had just that we have to

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:46.620
mention like spacey wouldn't have been

00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:48.980
possible without siphon and lots of other

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:50.620
probably most sometimes people don't

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:53.300
realize this but most Python packages you

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.020
use wouldn't have been possible without

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.020
c extensions and all you know the great

00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.980
work that it went into the siphon so I

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.660
feel like I should just mention that

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.800
because it's such a huge part of what

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.680
we're building but also one thing I was

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.080
really got into recently was like making

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.480
our code more consistent having like a

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.000
well formatted well organized code base

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.120
and so often when I start like organizing

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.040
things I kind of get really into it so

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.540
but like I've really started to

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.500
appreciate the black formatter the

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.000
auto formatting tool and just in general

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.940
the idea of okay enforcing opinionated

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:27.540
formatting rules automatically right as

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.960
like a pre-commit hook or something even

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.040
better right yeah or even maybe in you I

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.740
actually think for me it works well in my

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.220
editor because I actually if something

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.860
looks like super messy it does remind me

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.840
that like often the code is actually not

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.100
that great like if I write like a line of

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.000
code and then I see it gets spread over

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.620
five lines and actually looks more

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.540
confusing it often means that yeah okay I

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:49.320
maybe I shouldn't have had that for loop

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:53.000
and if statement on one line just to kind of

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.660
make things a bit like nicer actually it's

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.980
not it's harder to read I should refactor

00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:00.040
that so that's actually helped me quite a

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:02.460
lot and also just having yeah flake eight

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:04.880
I always kind of likes having you know kind

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.180
of a subset of rules that we enforce to

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:08.560
have some standards you know you don't have

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.000
to go over the top and like okay we want to

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.520
meet exactly everything but there's some

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.880
things that are very helpful you can catch

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.860
bugs that way and just having things nice

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:21.100
and tidy by default was very nice I like

00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:22.720
that it doesn't complain but that it just

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.100
fixes it rather than going here's the seven

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.640
things you need to go reformat it just goes

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.660
I'll reformat those right that's nice yeah

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.800
yeah and also even if you run diagnostics

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.880
it says okay here you you're overwriting

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.340
something you've imported you probably

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:35.680
didn't want to do that and then I look at

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.840
it I'm like yeah I didn't want to do that

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.100
or like okay something's under like

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.380
something's actually not defined yeah

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:45.440
that's that's a bug thanks so stuff like

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.400
that it's it's helpful it's simple and

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.120
especially if you have lots of open source

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.220
projects lots of code bases yeah a lot

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:53.320
of contributors yeah it's great yeah

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.220
all right yeah so I want to give you a

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:56.580
chance for a final call to action for

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.360
folks I think we already did that around

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.340
the building a successful software

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:02.980
business so maybe just around spacey and

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:04.500
prodigy tell people that are interested

00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:07.160
in NLP and what you guys are up to

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.660
where can they check it out if you don't

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.040
know about space yet you should check it

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.460
out if you feel like spacey is not going

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:13.460
to be useful to you then you don't like

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.260
I'm not you know I don't want to go

00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:16.360
here and tell everyone they should use

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.640
our software we're building very specific

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.620
maybe slightly niche developer product

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.040
developer tools but you know spacey I

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.260
think we really we put a lot of effort

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.180
into our documentation we have a nice

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:27.580
getting started guide if you're

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:29.480
interested I'm hoping it should you know

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.980
even give people who haven't really

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:33.020
worked much with machine learning a good

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.400
intro to how machine learning works with

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.680
text and how you know you can use that

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.020
productively yeah my your python keynote

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:42.400
was recorded and it's on YouTube so that

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.220
kind of has the full overview of all my

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.220
thoughts on that you know the stuff I

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:47.380
was saying yeah and I'll put the

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:49.060
keynote in the show notes as well of

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.880
course prodigy if you're working with

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:52.520
labeling data if you're training machine

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.120
learning models we're hoping that

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.940
prodigy is a good developer tool that

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:57.920
gets people productive we have a lot of

00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.040
people who felt like their work yeah it

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.160
really speeded up their workflow and

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.540
made them more efficient and yeah keep an

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:06.080
eye on prodigy for like our

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.520
announcement for prodigy scale which

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.920
takes it to the next level follow us on

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.740
Twitter because we have that's where we

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.400
announce new stuff we have a lot of

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.060
cool stuff coming excellent yeah a lot

00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.320
of great stuff people should check it

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.760
out and you know thank you for being on

bet bye bye this has been another

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.620
episode of talk python to me our guest

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.680

so much for listening I really

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.440
appreciate it now get out there and
