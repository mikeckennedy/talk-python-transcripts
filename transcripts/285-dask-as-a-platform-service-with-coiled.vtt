00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.880
If you're into data science, you've probably heard about Dask.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.820
It's a package that feels like familiar APIs such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.360
Yet it can scale that computation across CPU cores on your local machine

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.440
all the way to distributed grid-based computing in large clusters.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.300
While powerful, this takes some setup to execute in its full glory.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.520
That's why Matthew Rocklin has teamed up with Hugo Bowne-Anderson

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.740
and others to launch a business to help Python-loving data scientists

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.800
run Dask workloads in the cloud.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.520
And they're here to tell us all about how they've built this open-source foundational business.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.180
And you know what? They must be on to something.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.820
Between recording and releasing this episode,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.000
they just raised $5 million in VC funding.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.540
This is Talk Python To Me, episode 285, recorded August 12, 2020.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.280
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.320

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.840
Matthew, Hugo, welcome back to Talk Python To Me.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.400
Hi, Michael.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.040
Hey, Michael.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.060
Thanks for having us again after a couple of years.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.260
Yeah, it's fabulous to have you both back.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.180
You all were guests previously.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.940
Hugo, you were on a really popular episode 139,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.600
Paths into a Data Science Career,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.900
which I think is great helping people do that.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.240
And Matthew, you were 207, Paralyzing Computation with Dask.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.460
Oh, I think you'll beat me.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.360
You beat me on the show, Hugo.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.400
It's not a competition.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.020
But if it was, you're right.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.620
You would have won.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.780
Yes, that's right.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.140
But I think this talk is going to be a really interesting extension

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.320
of the one that you were on, Matthew,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.340
where we talked about the technical stuff of Dask and the computation.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.700
And now, you know, it's really grown a lot.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.000
That was February 2019.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.480
That was a time in the world when you could go places.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.600
Like you could just go out and you could go to a place where they made food

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.360
and you could physically touch another person

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.000
and then just take it and you wouldn't worry about it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.600
It was amazing.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.180
That's right.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.520
Yeah.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.860
The actual remote experience of developing software

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.840
hasn't changed a ton.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.780
I think actually people in our space have more or less the same workflow.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.700
We just, you know, don't see each other at conferences any longer.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.000
Yeah.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.180
Yeah.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.300
If we were accused of being antisocial as developers, well, we've taken it up a notch

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.500
or everyone's just come.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.400
Other people have come to join us in this weird world.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.360
But yeah, actually, I think software is pretty social as, you know, even though it gets categorized,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.280
not so much that way.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.100
So it's great to have you both back.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.680
I'm looking forward to talking about Dask, but especially Coiled and this new company you

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.500
are starting and this new platform you're starting sort of based on taking that to the next level.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.040
So it's going to be a really fun conversation.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.340
Yeah.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.120
I'm looking forward to it.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.520
As am I.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.280
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.840
Yeah.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.640
Now, before we get into it, though, you both were on before and I asked how you got into

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.840
programming and how you got into Python.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.180
So I might have a really, you know, maybe keep it short since there's two of you and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.320
we did cover some of the stuff a little before, but let's try a different question.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.880
How did you get into data science?

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.180
You go, you want to go first?

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.600
Sure.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.860
I was working in applied math in cell biology and biophysics.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.560
And my job was ostensibly to do a bunch of mathematical modeling.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.920
But all my collaborators were generating loads of data that I needed to figure out how to

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.780
analyze to collaborate with them and even, you know, play a big role in the iterative design

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.500
of experiments and all of this type of stuff.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.840
This was 2011, 2012.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.540
Excel didn't seem like a great answer.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.900
That's where I started.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.400
And then I went to R and then I went to Python and kind of learned them concurrently because

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.540
I was working with biologists.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.820
R was quite popular, but the IPython notebook was becoming more and more popular.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.480
It was a great resource for teaching oneself and teaching others.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.920
So I jumped in then and worked in research, worked in education a lot, and then moved to

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.180
industry, to tech, and started working in ed tech to educate people around all of these

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.680
tools as well.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.960
Yeah.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.580
Excellent.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.600
Matthew, how about yourself?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.820
I think for me, that probably the culmination point or the inflection point was just after

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.140
I graduated from university.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.640
I graduated with like a physics and astronomy degree.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.360
And I was looking at job applications.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.440
I didn't like any of the jobs that I was qualified for.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.540
But the jobs that I loved.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.360
I had the same feeling when I studied math.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.120
I'm like, I love this stuff, but what am I going to do with this?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.700
And none of this looks that great to me.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.800
But I didn't know how to code.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.740
I had been coding since I was like a kid on an old TI calculator.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.300
And all of the programming mixed with science jobs, those were fascinating.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.860
So I actually went into graduate school for computer science, scientific computing, and that

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.840
was a really good fit for me.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.140
I love that I got to touch all sorts of different domains.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.580
But that was probably the inflection point is looking at job applications after having

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.920
already graduated college and realizing, ah, I think I made a mistake.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.720
Maybe I should have turned left earlier.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.740
That's really interesting because a lot of people, they look around and they see folks

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.960
who have successfully created these amazing open source libraries and projects, initiatives,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.000
you know, like Dask.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.520
And they're like, the people who get to do that, they've been programming since they were

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.880
five and they got a computer science degree and they just knew they wanted to do that.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.560
And I think that's not actually as true as often people think it is.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.780
Right.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.560
I think none of us got computer science degrees.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.180
Is that fair?

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.240
Yeah, I didn't.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.000
I got a computer science book after I decided I didn't want to work in math anymore and started

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.820
like, you know, C++ book and started going on that.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.100
That's not the same as a degree though.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.520
Good plan.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.240
I feel like there's an analog in the data science world as well with respect to, you know,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.940
all these boot camps that happen now and now masters in data science at prestigious

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.980
universities and relatively few people I know at least have taken the university track.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.560
I think boot camp to junior data scientist positions far more prevalent.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.000
But for more on that, you can check out the previous episode that I recorded with Michael.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.640
Yes, exactly.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.840
We've got a whole show on that one.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.580
So, all right.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.480
Now, the last time we spoke, Hugo, you were at data camp doing stuff with teaching people

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.280
online Python stuff.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.780
That was awesome.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.760
And Matthew, yeah, yeah, cool.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.480
And Matthew, you were just moving to do a little bit of collaborative stuff with NVIDIA, but

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.780
now you both have, you know, teamed up, joined forces to do something else, right?

00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.640
What are you doing nowadays?

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:06.080
So, we're building a company called Coiled, essentially to productize for the enterprise

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.440
a lot of features of the PyData ecosystem and Dask in particular.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.760
So, the V1 of our product, we're just about to launch.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.720
So, it's mid-August 2020, we're about to launch, is managing Dask and distributed compute

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.740
in the cloud for you and handling security, conda doc environments, team management, this

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.300
type of stuff.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.940
And that doesn't really say what we do on a day-to-day basis.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.960
I think I could list what we don't do on a day-to-day basis more quickly than what we do.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.240
Yeah, sure.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.060
But having, you know, incorporated the company in February, it's kind of waking up every day

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.800
and seeing what the most impactful stuff we can do actually is.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.880
And that's really exciting.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.000
And it's a great, I'm really excited to work with Matt and the whole Coiled team.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.820
Matthew, how about you?

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.700
What do you do day to day?

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.720
You've joined up with Hugo on Coiled.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.100
Yeah.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.640
So, day-to-day, you know, I still help maintain Dask.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.040
So, there's a ton of GitHub conversations, you know, Discord, Stack Overflow.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.580
But now, we're also making a company.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.840
So, we're, you know, figuring out sales.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.600
We're figuring out legal.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.980
There's a ton of sort of nuts and bolts of running a company.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.820
That is quite difficult.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.720
As Hugo was saying, listening to what you can do is different from what you can't.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.120
Yeah, exactly.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:16.500
So, you went to school for physics and astronomy, and then you got a master's degree in computer science, and then you did some really interesting data science around Dask.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:24.180
I bet none of that taught you about marketing funnels or accounting or taxation law or any of that fun stuff, right?

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.180
You'd actually be surprised.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.080
Like, running...

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.760
Like, yeah.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.880
Maintaining an open source project includes lots of those things.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.220
Okay.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.980
So, there's actually a lot of, like, we're hiring.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.520
We do a lot of community management.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.340
There's a lot of, like, employer-employee kinds of relationships that occur.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:37.620
Right.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.800
People are new to the project.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.200
Okay.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:39.440
Yeah.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.780
You need to have relationships with large companies like NVIDIA or Google or Microsoft.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.800
Like, running a sizable open source project is actually not so dissimilar from running a business.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.160
Yeah.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.480
Now, taxation laws and legal agreements, there's certainly more of them now.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.080
Probably so.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.000
But, yeah, you guys probably wear a lot of hats as you're getting this stuff off the ground.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.460
Indeed.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.060
Very much so.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:58.140
Yeah.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:04.220
And to speak to Matt's point, when we first started working together, he was like, okay, what's the call to action on the landing page?

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.960
And I was like, oh, great.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.520
Let's have that conversation.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:17.040
And his, you know, appreciation of design ethics, sorry, design aesthetics and marketing funnels, I think is actually, I was pleasantly surprised.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.360
Yeah.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.600
Well, I mean, so there are probably, you know, 10 to 15 to 20 people who work on desk at different companies.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.040
You know, many of whom we've, like, tried to get jobs.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.040
So, you know, we do marketing.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.760
We do sales.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.360
We do all of those kinds of things you do inside of companies.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.740
We just do it without paying anybody directly or without having any actual control over everything.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.320
Running with responsibility is kind of like running a company without any power.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.680
It's a lot of soft power.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.000
Sounds like product management.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.180
Yeah, I can imagine.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.340
Sure.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:44.820
It does.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.160
I don't know.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.820
All right.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.140
Cool.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.140
And I guess also just throw out there really quick, Hugo, you did the DataFrame podcast for a while.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.660
So people may also know you from there as well, right?

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.360
Are you still doing that?

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.480
No, no, I'm not.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.260
And I miss podcasting a great deal.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.760
I'm very much enjoying going on podcasts.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:04.880
But Matt and I have some secret plans to start podcasting in the nearish future.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.220
So that may be a bit of a teaser there.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.180
But yeah, that was a really fun podcast to put out weekly.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.540
And of course, I came on your show, on this show before doing that.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:25.040
I just want to let everyone know that Michael was actually incredibly helpful in getting the podcast up and running and letting me know all the things that he learned along the way that, you know, I still learned a lot along the way.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.060
But there are several things that Michael helped so wonderfully with.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.140
So thank you for that, Michael.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.100
Oh, you're really welcome.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.800
I was glad to see you having success there.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.100
And I'm looking forward to whatever secret project you guys have in mind.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.740
As am I.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.540
Awesome.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:47.900
So we're going to talk about Dask and open source and where maybe some sort of company making this a little more powerful or amplifying the message there might come from.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.620
But I wanted to start a conversation a little more broad and philosophical.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.700
So I'm going to talk about two things real quick.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:02.480
First of all, we saw in 2017, Stack Overflow published an article called The Incredible Growth of Python.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.200
And it showed Python being pretty flat for many years, relatively, along with a bunch of other languages.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:14.400
And then around 2012, you know, somebody kicked the derivative up or the second derivative.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.860
And it just took off.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.400
Right.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.120
And it went up and up.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.320
And they said, look at this.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.780
It's about to pass these other languages.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.960
And if we predict out, look how crazy it's going to get.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.860
And, you know, that was three years ago.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.900
We can look back, you know, I'll actually link to the Stack Overflow trends now.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.940
And those predictions underestimated how popular Python was going to be.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.880
But more so, they underestimated the stability of the other languages.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.680
And they're actually going down more than the flatness that they predicted, which is, I think all those kinds of things is really interesting.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:49.900
My theory is a lot of folks came into Python because of the data science stack around that timeframe.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:12:01.520
And so I guess my question to you all is, you know, how much is this incredible growth of Python, the incredible growth of data science in Python versus more broad stories around there?

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:07.380
I think there's a lot of, I think the data science or scientific stack inside of Python certainly played a large role in that.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:15.540
And, you know, I think that's because we understood, I think that the scientific stack targeted very much scientific users, which were a good proxy for data science users today.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:15.800
Yeah.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.900
And so we had the same combination of performance and accessibility that was necessary to meet that need.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.600
So we're sort of ahead of the game by accident.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.540
Those are why a lot of the maintainers have a science background.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:25.780
Right.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:37.040
What I would say, though, is that Python is really only powerful today because of that union of the data science stack with the web stack, with the visualization stack, with the system operations stack.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:46.340
And it's really the fact that we can do all of those things together, which make Python sort of the standard default place to build advanced applications today.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:52.360
You know, if we were only MATLAB, for example, and we couldn't do web servers, we would be sort of a fringe language.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.260
We would be a niche.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.180
If we were only, you know, Scala and could do only Spark, we would also be sort of a niche.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.540
Python can do everything.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.480
And that is where you can build these really rich and awesome applications.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:02.860
Yeah.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.000
I think that's a really good point.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:12.660
I mean, people talk about that's why Node.js had the interest that it did, because you could sort of solve the problem in all the places you had to work.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:20.580
And I feel like that's kind of the story as well for Python on the scientific computation side and to some degree on the website as well.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.200
I mean, we all have to write HTML and stuff.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:31.360
But, you know, the way I think of it is, you know, if there's a biologist who's coming in and she has to do a little bit of computation, she's like, okay, I just need to do this.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.560
I need to make this graph.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.140
This data is too big for whatever.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:44.160
If I can write these 10 lines of code, not even in a function, just top to bottom, straight down, write these five lines, 10 lines of code, get this amazing output by using all these libraries.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.980
Eventually, the idea of like, well, maybe I need to pass different data.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.120
So maybe I need to write a function.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.860
And then, you know, you get a little bit farther.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.320
No, now I'm going to reuse this.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.520
I'm going to make this package.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.120
Right.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.740
You know, two years later, you look back and it's like, how did I become a programmer?

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.760
I thought I was a biologist.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.980
I never, ever intended to be that.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.020
So I feel like Python brings a lot of people in through that sort of gravity.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:13.820
But because it'll solve the problems that are more advanced and has this rich sort of top end, you don't have to abandon it like you would MATLAB and go learn something else.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.800
You just get to stay there.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.600
And I think people are, it's sticky in that regard.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.140
I agree.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.420
This is a really common theme in how we think about data science.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.560
There's this on-ramp, right?

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.080
You know nothing or you know how to use Excel.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.400
You can use a little bit of pandas.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.880
You can use a little bit of Dask on one machine.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.420
You can go out to scale on a cloud.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.560
You can run on the world's biggest supercomputers, right?

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.480
And it's that smooth experience that we think about.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.560
We're getting ahead of myself a little bit talking about Dask.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:45.340
But that smooth experience of starting from nothing and working up to being amazing is what I think a lot of the Python ethos is about.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.340
Yeah, I agree.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.220
I agree with all of that.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:53.480
And I do think it's the rise of an entire community and network of tooling in the Python landscape.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:01.420
It's also the rise of tireless educators such as the carpentries, data carpentry and software carpentry bringing this stuff around the world.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:07.240
I'm very humbled to have played a small role in my work at DataCamp to spread the gospel of Python.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.780
I've never used that term before.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.120
We'll see how that lands.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:20.640
The other thing I think that I've been really excited about is seeing the wider Python community embrace data science as a fundamental part of the Python landscape now.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:27.680
I don't know if anyone's done a data analysis of, let's say, data science talks and keynotes and tutorials at PyCon over the past 10 years.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.720
But at least anecdotally, we've seen a huge embrace there.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.820
I mean, it was where we first met in your hometown of Portland, right?

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.200
Oregon.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:34.760
Yeah.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.180
Right.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.220
Catherine Hough and Jake Vanderplus were two keynotes several years ago.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:39.820
And I was like, oh, wow.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.540
Yeah, they talked about the mosaic and it was beautiful.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.120
And we're having keynotes from the Python community.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.600
Exactly.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.380
Yeah.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.200
Super interesting.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:54.540
So I do think that that's a lot of the magic of Python is that it welcomes people from these different areas.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.640
And there was a really interesting survey.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:08.920
I think it was the JetBrains PSF combined survey that asked something like, how many you are data scientists and what percentage of the Python community do you believe data scientists are?

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:22.080
And data scientists made up almost like the equal partition of web, which were the two biggest groups, but they thought they were much less represented because they, I think they felt like they were working more individually, but there were just so many of them.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.700
So it was really interesting that they believed that they were not as big of a part as they actually were.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.960
But I think that that perception is starting to change.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.500
I'd be interested in what type of like self-identification bias there is with respect to data science.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:40.880
Like I almost get the impression everyone has to identify as a data scientist these days, even like whatever they do, even if they're a gardener.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.880
It's true.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.140
It's true.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.960
Have you, have you touched pandas?

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.460
Then you are.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:51.880
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Brilliant.org.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:59.520
Brilliant has digestible courses in topics from the basics of scientific thinking all the way up to high-end science like quantum computing.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:05.340
And while quantum computing may sound complicated, Brilliant makes complex learning uncomplicated and fun.

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.480
It's super easy to get started, and they've got so many science and math courses to choose from.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:14.500
I recently used Brilliant to get into rocket science for an upcoming episode, and it was a blast.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:21.880
The interactive courses are presented in a clean and accessible way, and you could go from knowing nothing about a topic to having a deep understanding.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.440
Put your spare time to good use and hugely improve your critical thinking skills.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:49.480
Another thing that I want to ask you in this sort of philosophical idea is that I mostly do web stuff with Python.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.560
So I run my online stuff, my online training company, and various things with Python.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.680
But obviously, I'm interested in all of it.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:12.080
When I look at the web world, I feel like once Python 3 really got fully adopted, or at least became the default thing to do, a whole bunch of older ideas were all of a sudden still relevant, but they became, you know, that's neat.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.020
But let's rethink this now that we can.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:24.660
So I'm thinking of things like FastAPI, where they use type annotations to mean stuff, or, you know, things like that, or we're going to build this from the ground up with async and await, and so on.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:30.300
So there were just so many different web frameworks and other tools that just came out of nowhere.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.700
And some of them are not really maintained anymore.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.220
But all these flowers bloomed.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.120
And it was just a really interesting thing to see.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.620
I don't have the same visibility in the data science side for that.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.740
Did that happen?

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.960
And what was it like?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.920
I think to a certain extent, it did.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:53.580
I think probably larger is the widespread adoption of tools and not necessarily the creation of new tooling and the development of specific tooling as well.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.700
But there are several tools.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:59.360
I think the first one that really is so important is the Jupyter ecosystem.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:06.220
I referred to IPython notebooks, and I did that accidentally, but also intentionally, because they were IPython notebooks back then, right?

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.460
That was super cool.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:13.260
And I feel like people forget about IPython, but it's so important in the Jupyter ecosystem.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:24.260
But yeah, since 3.6, we've seen two years ago, like JupyterLab 1.0, which I think brings the possibility of so many new people to use the entire ecosystem.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:32.000
I always think JupyterLab does for Python, I think, what the RStudio IDE does for the R ecosystem.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.540
It reduces the barrier to entry for so many people.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:41.240
But then, as we've noted in other conversations, tools like Streamlit are really cool.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:51.800
And I think this is going to be the next evolution of data tooling is bridging the gap between local computation and iterative science in Python and productionized science, right?

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.740
And machine learning.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:59.740
So the ability to kind of build a machine learning product quite quickly is wonderful there.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:08.680
Yeah, Streamlit was definitely one of the things that came to mind for me is like, this is really a different take on how this works, but it's kind of a neat, modern way to do it.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.140
Exactly.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.900
So for me, it wasn't so much the change of Python 3.6.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:19.540
I think the scientific stack, the PyData stack actually adopted Python 3 like two or three years before the web stack.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.060
Yeah, they definitely had a head start there.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:22.600
That was great.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.400
So I think that wasn't as transformational.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.400
We had a much more smooth transition, I think.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:34.140
I think around the same time, though, there was this huge influx of new people and new actors in the system.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:49.560
So there's like, you know, as we shifted from being this sort of fringe scientific computing language to becoming the de facto standard language for ML AI workloads, with the option of like TensorFlow and PyTorch, you've got, you know, Google and Facebook acting, you've got Nvidia in there now.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.000
And you have just, you know, a 10x in the user growth.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.920
That is really, I think, our like, change moment is the like the TensorFlow engagement of companies for better or for worse.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.180
Yeah.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:11.540
What about enterprises and large corporations seeing the PyData stack as legitimately the thing that they could adopt over, I don't know, saying they have to do with Java or something like that?

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.380
Like, it seems like that's changed as well.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:19.660
Yeah, there's a huge acceptance of Python in both in the data science machine learning space, but also in production, right?

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.980
As sort of Docker came up and as Kubernetes came up, like Python became a thing you could easily deploy into PenPom.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.080
And that's new as of the last decade.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:32.640
And with that comes a bunch of money to be made, which again, brings in this like other slew of actors in this space.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:32.900
Yeah.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.280
Both good and bad.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:34.480
Yeah.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:42.780
I think this is something which started for the most part in tech, where we saw massive, massive wins in open source adoption and then bled out slowly.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:49.960
I mean, finances is a great example, like seeing how much places like JPMC and Capital One and these places use Python now.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.680
But then we're seeing it in retail.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.880
I mean, one of the great use cases of Dask and Rapids and XGBoost is at Walmart.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:04.120
Going back to tech, the fact that Netflix runs like hundreds of thousands of Jupyter notebook batch jobs a day or something like that.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:04.860
And they're hiring.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.620
I mean, they've got a bunch of Jupyter core devs, right?

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.840
Yeah, their whole paper mill thing.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.180
Yeah.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.080
Yeah, that's really interesting.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:21.920
I guess the early start on Python 3, because a lot of the tooling was improving and there wasn't as much like legacy Python data science.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.340
I think that was part of the key to being able to just say, you know what?

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.760
We're just going to start something new on these new set of tools, new machine learning library.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.920
Let's just use Python 3 as opposed to, well, we're still on this web framework.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.160
We can't change versions.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.500
And that thing depends on this.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.120
So we're stuck, you know, seven or eight years in the past.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.500
So, yeah, pretty cool.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.980
I mean, it was still a huge effort.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.320
But I think there's just like there was less production use of the data science stack.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.600
It seemed like there was production use of the web stack.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.860
And that's what's really hard to change.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:56.380
And I'll also add that data scientists require flexibility and nimbleness and agility in their tooling.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.720
And it's such the questions they're answering are changing so quickly.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.300
The way these questions integrate into making business decisions.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:07.720
And that interface is changing so quickly that the tooling is kind of moving alongside that.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.480
And there's this wonderful co-evolution between the tooling and the techniques and the questions that we're required to answer.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.740
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.200
All right.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.120
So let's set the foundation for this project, this company that you all are working on.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.620
And that would be Dask.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.200
Matthew, you want to kick us off?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.800
Tell us, you give us the summary of Dask and all the cool things that it does.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.240
I mean, we did talk about it at WAGA, but that was over a year and probably not everyone heard it anyway.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.920
Yeah, sure.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:37.400
So Dask is an open source Python library that was designed to parallelize other Python libraries.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.000
So we first started Dask at Anaconda.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And the goal was to parallelize out NumPy and Pandas and scikit-learn to sort of like the foundation of the sort of scientific Python Python Python stack.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.120
What we found pretty quickly is that about half users we were targeting, that's exactly what they wanted.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.620
They had a big table or a big array of numbers.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:01.100
And they wanted a bigger version of those things with the same APIs and the same feel.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.200
And so Dask gave that to them.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.140
But about half of our users wanted to do something totally different.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:11.080
They wanted to use the internals of Dask to parallelize out some other crazy thing that they were building.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.440
As we mentioned, in Python, people were building all sorts of new libraries.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.500
And they wanted to add a little parallelism, a little bit of scalability into their library.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:18.760
Yeah.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.040
And the internals of Dask allowed them to do that.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.240
So Dask is, at its core, a general purpose library for parallel computing.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:30.140
You can think of it in the same way you think of the threading module or the concurrent futures module

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.440
or anything like that in the standard library.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.760
But it runs at scale and gives you full scalability.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.000
Right.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.840
When you say at scale, you mean you could have a cluster of 20 machines.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.100
Yeah.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:40.620
Or 200.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.040
Yeah.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.920
Something that looks like a Pandas data frame.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.700
And you ask it to do computation.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.080
And that computation happens on all those machines.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.500
Exactly.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:48.860
Yeah.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.000
And it's really smart about not moving data.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.300
Because if you've got a lot of data, the movement of it around might actually be the slowest

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:55.760
part, right?

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:55.980
Yeah.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.140
That and like 20 things.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:57.360
Yeah.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.780
So we think very, very deeply about how to run complicated task graphs at scale.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.660
And that allows for us to do things like big pandas.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.540
But also, you could use it in the same way you use Celery behind a web application.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:12.500
Or you could use it backing a big machine learning application.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:18.060
So Dask is a very flexible tool on which many people have built these sort of more special

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.760
purpose scalability tools.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.520
You can think of it kind of like a tool that you would use to build Spark or the tool that

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.740
you would use to build a parallel airflow, for example.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.040
I'll just build on this briefly by quoting Matt.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.420
And I always quote him on this.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.840
So he's heard me quote him many times on this.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.740
But this is a blog post he wrote called A Brief History of Dask, which you can find on

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.120
coil.io forward slash blog.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:45.400
But he speaks to three goals that the original idea that him and several other people at Anaconda

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.140
were thinking about.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:50.220
Two technical goals, which were to harness the power of all the cores on your laptop in

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:50.540
parallel.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.160
A second one to support larger than memory computation.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.020
And these we know about.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.900
But he also mentions a social goal, which is to invent nothing.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.840
And I quote, we wanted to be as familiar as possible to what users already knew in the

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.880
Pi data stack.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:08.640
And I think as the Pi data stack grew and garnered a lot of adoption, the fact that there was

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.340
a social goal to invent nothing allows pandas and NumPy users then to use it immediately.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:18.740
And Matt says, you know, doesn't have an API because it uses the API, the packages that

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.500
it allows people to do distributed compute with.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.080
Yeah, that's a really good goal because it doesn't matter how amazing the thing you came

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.540
up with.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:31.700
If you say, OK, well, you used to talk to databases, but now use our special API that's

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.180
like a database, but it's not exactly because it's better.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.840
And we have this graphing thing and it's like Altair, but it's not really Altair.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.060
It's just motivated by it.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.500
So you can just redo all your stuff and it's going to be better.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.840
And, you know, a lot of times it's like, you know what?

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.820
The tools that I have really work well and I don't want to reinvent my world.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.280
Exactly.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:49.740
Yeah.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.280
I call this the principle of minimal creativity.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.660
I love it.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.560
It's like productive.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.820
That's a beautiful one.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:01.860
It's similar to the productive, like laziness of developers or something like that.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.080
Right?

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.420
Sure.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.000
Yeah.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.780
This thing that we thought was great, creativity, you know, building a new wonderful thing is

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.400
actually horrible.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.240
Like you really don't want to impose your thoughts on others.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.380
Building boring tools.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:12.680
Yeah.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:12.960
Right.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.980
Building boring tools.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:14.200
Yeah.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:14.760
Yeah.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.040
Otherwise known as getting stuff done, right?

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.700
This portion of Talk Python To Me is sponsored by Monday.com.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:30.260
Monday.com is an online platform that powers over 100,000 teams daily work.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:35.800
It's an easy to use, flexible and visual teamwork platform beautifully designed to manage any

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.800
team organization or online process.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.720
Now, for most of us, we missed our chance to build the first apps ever in the mobile app

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.020
stores.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.420
It was a once in a lifetime opportunity, but it's one that's coming around again.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:53.220
Monday.com is launching their marketplace and running a contest for the best new apps featured

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.220
right from the get go.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.740
Want to be one of the first in the Monday.com apps marketplace?

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.220
Start building today.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:06.080
They're even giving away $184,000 in prizes, including three Teslas, 10 MacBooks, and more.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.220
Build your idea for an app and get in front of hundreds of thousands of users on day one.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:15.320
Start building today by visiting monday.com slash Python, or just click the link in your

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.540
podcast player's show notes.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:22.700
My understanding is that Dask is used for all these different projects.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.040
And like sometimes you'll find Dask being used and you're not even really aware that

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.680
Dask is somehow powering maybe it's parallelism or whatever.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:36.600
So maybe give us a couple of examples of places you found Dask being used that surprised you or

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.420
you're proud of.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.060
Yeah, sure.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.160
I'll maybe talk about maybe Pangio first.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.040
So I think I mentioned Pangio at the end of our last podcast.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.640
Yeah.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.340
So Pangio is amazing.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.620
Pangio is a collaboration of earth scientists, so like climate scientists, meteorologists,

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:57.220
oceanographers, and a bunch of open source software developers who teamed up to make a new software

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.340
stack to solve a lot of climate science problems.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:04.580
We combined things like JupyterHub, Dask, Kubernetes, and other libraries on top of that, like Xarray,

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.260
intake, all sorts of things.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:06.520
Yeah.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.340
And we just like, we revolutionized the way that that sector computes.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:16.500
There were sort of decades old software stacks that we just immediately showed were not nearly

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.740
as powerful as we were able to do together, both in terms of computation and in terms of

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.100
accessibility.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.500
It's at the point where, you know, if you were an undergraduate student in the Philippines,

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:31.020
you can go and you can look at cloud-based data sets that are many terabytes large and

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.300
see, you know, what climate change will do with sea level rise, for example.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.060
And that's something that we were all, that happened in like six or 12 months.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:37.540
It was amazing.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.840
And that's such an important problem that we need to solve.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:46.160
And so to know that some of the software you helped create is central to making that happen.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:46.820
That's really cool.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.280
Me and like a thousand other people.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:48.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.180
Of course.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.260
Absolutely.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:50.660
Yeah.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:55.160
But it was a great, it was a great example of a bunch of different kinds of people all

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:55.780
working together.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.540
It was a bunch of like computer scientists working together.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.780
We wouldn't have done it correctly.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.240
Once the oceanographers are working together, it wouldn't have done it all together.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.600
It needed to be a collaboration.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.060
Right.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:03.300
Yeah.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.740
How many oceanographers are like, you know what?

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.960
I'm going to set up a Kubernetes cluster so we can do automatic scale out, but then scale

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.340
back down.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:10.780
You'd be surprised.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:10.960
You know what?

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.420
No, no, I know.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.600
You'd be surprised.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.620
They ended up having to learn those skill sets over time, which is partially why we made Coiled,

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.060
is to stop that from having to be the case.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.020
They're also sharp folks.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.980
I mean, people who are in that space are quite sharp.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.780
Another example might be so Rapids.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.100
So when we last talked, I had just joined NVIDIA.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:33.920
So at the time, NVIDIA was building Rapids data science suite that is GPU accelerated.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.020
So they have like NumPy, Pandas, CycleLearn equivalents that all run on the GPU.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.580
It's a little bit like what Dask does for parallelism.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:45.060
They're somewhat attempting to do that for the CUDA cores and GPU, right?

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:45.720
Yeah, exactly.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.020
So, you know, Dask allowed you to do from Pandas to parallel Pandas.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:54.100
Rapids allows you to go from Pandas to GPU accelerated Pandas.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.940
And then Rapids and Dask together allow you to go to, you know, GPU accelerated Pandas across

00:30:58.940 --> 00:30:59.720
the cluster of machines.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.360
Yeah, that's a great way to put it together.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:02.680
Yeah.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.580
The really great result we had out there, which is super surprising to me, was they did a

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:11.740
benchmark, the TPC XPB benchmark, where there's like a bunch of sort of data science and business

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.840
analytics queries.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:18.500
And they got something like 40% faster and like seven times cheaper than the next solution,

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.220
which is like Spark or MapReduce on a bunch of Dell machines.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:21.580
Yeah.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.140
And so in some sense, that's like 400, right?

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.280
Because it's, you know, the 40X faster and the cheaper, right?

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.620
Because normally you think I can get a lot faster, but I spend a lot of more money or I can get

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.980
cheaper, but it goes a lot slower.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.920
But if you get it to expand in both axes, that's awesome.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.120
No, to be honest here, it's a more expensive machine, but running for a much shorter amount

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:41.400
of time.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:41.660
Yeah.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.100
So it's not 400X, it's genuinely 40X faster and only 7X cheaper.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.440
But yeah, no, it's amazing.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.560
And I think what I love about that is that there are all of these sort of old guard companies

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.620
building out solutions for this benchmark.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:59.040
You've got Dell, HHP, and they're all using like monolith software projects like Spark.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.800
And this benchmark was different.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:06.060
It was NVIDIA and it was people at Coiled and it was people at Blazing SQL, another startup

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.540
company.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:11.520
There are a bunch of small startups and a bunch of small software projects that all collaborated

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.840
together to just smash this benchmark, right?

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.340
All the other companies were fighting over sort of 10%, 20% gains.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.960
And we come in with like a 40X speed improvement.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.560
And so it just sort of, we just wiped everyone out, which was great.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.040
Yeah, that's a super cool project.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.920
And Rapids, I mean, it seems like that's a pretty early stage project and it's probably

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.560
just going to grow.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.700
Early stage of moving fast.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:38.640
I mean, that's an example of a company investing in open source with a team of 50 people.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.680
It's impressive.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:44.000
And then the last one I might mention is Napari, which is kind of like Pangeo in that

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.660
they are using Dask to advance another field, in this case, biomedical imaging.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.960
But their approach is really different.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.980
A lot of lab bench scientists, people who are looking at microscopes, don't know how to program.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.260
And so we can't give them a Jupyter notebook that they can play with.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.960
Instead, they're used to sort of point and click interfaces.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.720
And so Napari is an image viewer for large images.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.100
With a point and click interface, you sort of pan and zoom around these, you know, picture

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.160
of a cell or picture of some sort of cancer thing.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.840
And what I love about this is that they use other parts of Python.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.940
They use the whole QT side of Python.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.100
So that's a QT based application.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.060
And they're not targeting data scientists.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.160
They're targeting actual scientists.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:26.460
And I think that's like a great space for growth of Python in the future is to build applications.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.520
Because it's one thing to say we build it for data scientists.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:35.120
We're kind of like Python programmers in general, but they have this special visualization data

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:41.560
handling skill set as opposed to the person who took your x-rays or whatever, right?

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.500
Yeah, exactly.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.040
And also there's an order of magnitude growth that we can have.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:46.280
Yeah.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:51.240
And I'll also add to that that I've spoken with several users of Napari recently and the way

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.020
it changes their approach to science and their scientific flow.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.820
I mean, they can do a bunch of imaging.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.220
And whereas previously they'd have to wait until the next day to check out the images,

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:05.020
they can literally go away for 15 to 30 minutes, come back, check out the images, then plan the

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:05.680
next experiment.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:11.100
So it changes their absolute flow state of scientific research and the rapid iterative

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:11.740
cycle for them.

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:12.980
Yeah, that's really awesome.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.800
I mean, it's got to feel great to work on that project and just see, you know, it's making a true

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.840
impact for everyday people.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.560
Yeah, that's cool.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:26.580
The one other thing I'll add, which I think we hinted at before, is that Dask is famously used for

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:31.940
leveraging clusters and parallelization, but it also does it locally.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.600
So before you scale out to your cluster or whatever, you can scale up to do out-of-core

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.980
computing on larger data sets yourself.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:44.940
So it allows a lot of people to do more locally than they'd otherwise be able to across all

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.740
the types of questions we've been discussing, which is pretty cool.

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:48.320
Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:53.720
Well, you know, the MacBook that I'm sitting here with, the MacBook Pro is a core i9 with

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.660
six hyper-threaded cores.

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.940
So 12, basically.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:02.120
And if I go and do Python stuff really hard on it, I get one twelfth the CPU consumption

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:02.820
of what's available.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.780
And my gaming machine is, you know, 16 cores, right?

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:11.440
It's like, if that stuff is just mostly idle in the Python world, unless you find a way to

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.120
take advantage of it.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.840
And so that actually really surprised me about Dask.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.120
I thought of Dask as, you know, the way we sort of opened the conversation.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.720
It's this way to take huge data that has to fit into a cluster and not just onto my little

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.400
laptop and run it distributed in terms of distributed machines.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.660
But the fact that it also runs and sort of scales up and takes better advantage of your

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.780
local hardware is pretty awesome.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.460
The median cluster size is one, which is just a laptop.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.320
And so we optimize for that case.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:36.700
Yeah.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:37.800
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.800
I was going to add, the other thing to note is the interoperability with a lot of other

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.200
packages.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:47.120
So if you're using scikit-learn and you want to parallelize your hyperparameter search or

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.820
whatever it is, you can use the, I think it's the njobs quag or something like that.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.640
And you can use Dask in the backend there.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.960
Recently, I was so excited to see Matt.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.100
We're doing these YouTube live streams weekly of people using Dask and a bunch of other

00:35:59.100 --> 00:35:59.380
stuff.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.160
So subscribe to our YouTube channel if you're interested.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:09.960
But marketing aside, somebody from Grubhub, Alex Egg, used Snorkel for weak supervision, which

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:15.140
is a clever way to label your data for supervised learning without actually hand labeling it.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:20.280
And I saw Matt discover a sub-module of Snorkel called Snorkel Dask.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.760
So seeing, you know, the whole array, the whole ecosystem start to incorporate Dask is really

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.420
exciting, right?

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:25.780
Yeah.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:26.280
Yeah, that's cool.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.520
I had no idea they'd integrated it.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.240
I was like, oh, I just learned something today.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.860
They're using this stuff.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.120
Great.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.620
That's really, really neat.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.580
And yeah, I'll put a link to your YouTube channel there so people can check it out.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.660
I think it's really interesting that people are doing stuff on Twitch and programming,

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:45.820
all these live streaming places that I never associated with programming for the longest

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.240
time.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.860
It was always, you know, World of Warcraft or some other sort of gaming thing that was in

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.500
a different world.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.100
It all starts with gaming, man.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.280
Gaming's ahead of the curve, right?

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.220
Switching, putting on my for-profit hat just for a second.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:04.120
Like now in COVID times, like marketing is completely the Wild West again.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.660
Like we've got to figure out how to reach our audience.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.580
I used to go to conferences and just know everybody.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.000
Now, how do we do that?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.420
You know, Twitch or live streaming is like a thing to play with.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.520
Probably not the right thing, but we're going to find out.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:19.320
And experimenting and finding out the right way to engage people today is actually a really

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.000
fun and interesting problem for which there are no right answers yet.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.500
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.760
It definitely is the Wild West and it's a fun time, right?

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.900
Like you said, it's unknown, but it's really cool to be able to just explore all these

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.460
different ideas.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.000
Hey, Hugo, marketing idea for you.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.220
Let's get on all the cool Python podcasts and see if they can cross-market to coiled things.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.480
I think that's a great idea.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.660
Let me just note that down.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.660
Yeah, great.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:44.300
Yeah, well, I don't really know which ones you should talk to, but we talk after.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.100
We embrace them after.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.700
Who should we talk Python to?

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:47.780
I know, I know.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:52.720
All right, so let's take it over to the business side a little bit.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.900
We have DASK.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.820
We talked about some of the things that it does.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:00.740
One of the interesting challenges people often run into when they have these successful projects

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:07.140
is how do I take this really amazing and powerful thing that I built and allow me to keep working

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.380
on it by somehow getting paid to do so, right?

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:17.540
And I think probably the first step is we've seen a really big adoption of open source software on the enterprise.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.140
It used to be, oh, what are you going to be doing?

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.680
Are you doing Java and Oracle?

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.360
Or are you doing Microsoft?

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.300
Which type of company are you at, right?

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:36.300
Like there's a lot of, there's even like Gardner reports talking about how open source software has not just lowered the cost for enterprises,

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.900
but actually increased the quality at the same time, which is like one of these double wins as well.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:41.880
How do you guys see it?

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:50.260
So I'll add one more piece of the puzzle to the question in the sense that not only are we seeing a lot of people in enterprise adopting open source,

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:55.420
we're seeing, I'm actually going to paraphrase Brian Granger, who said this a couple of years ago at Jupiticon.

00:38:55.420 --> 00:39:04.640
We're seeing a phase transition from a lot of people using open source individually in enterprise to large scale enterprise adoption of open source.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:12.920
So having individuals use it within an organization, I think is, is something where the open source provides nearly all the value they, they need there.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:18.420
But for an institution to actually adopt OSS at scale across an organization,

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:23.820
there are other moving parts that need to be in place that I think commercial companies can solve for.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.280
So having said that, maybe Matt can talk about why we're starting Coiled.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:27.660
Yeah.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.540
I love the Brian phrase, phase transition language.

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.300
That sounds exactly like Brian, who's a physicist.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:32.720
Physicist.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.540
Physicist who then made Jupyter notebooks.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.180
Yeah.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:39.120
The way I think of it is that, sorry, so open source software one, right?

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.080
So like no new company is installing Oracle or SAS today.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.620
They're installing open source.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:49.980
But as we tossed out all of these sort of enterprise software companies and their enterprise software stacks,

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:54.120
we accidentally tossed out all the things they sold us that weren't software, right?

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.060
So like they would, Oracle would sell you, you know, their database things.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.560
Like service level agreements.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.200
Exactly.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.300
How do, how do we get help if we're stuck and it does not working?

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.500
All that kind of stuff, right?

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.720
The sort of training safety blanket of commercial software.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:06.920
Yeah.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:12.360
Training, the safety blanket of enterprise support, but also, you know, hooking into enterprise office systems

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:17.300
or network security or sort of plugging all of those things together, integrating with other technologies.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.620
And now that all these companies are adopting this open source stack, all of that stuff is missing.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.380
And so it is again, the wild west.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.900
And it's sort of a, it's an awkward place as a company to be adopting this technology.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:35.800
I was in a conversation once with folks at NASA and they were saying, hey, look, what hosted notebook solution should we use?

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.760
At the time there was, there was Domino Data Labs.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.640
There was Anaconda Enterprise was selling something.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.520
There was AWS SageMaker.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.780
And I said, hey, have you considered just using JupyterHub?

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.200
It's actually a really pleasant experience and it's free and it's easy to use.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.260
And they said, no, but like we need to buy something.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.820
Like we're not going to manage JupyterHub.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.360
We need to buy something because we're NASA.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.380
And the open source thought is just, it's free.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.700
Why don't you just take it?

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.820
It's not so hard.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:04.260
But of course for them, they don't want another puppy.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.880
Right, exactly.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.380
A thing they got to take care of and walk even in the rain.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:07.720
Yeah.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.120
And so that, I think filling in those gaps and providing all of that sort of supporting infrastructure,

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:17.720
which is both technological and cultural infrastructure, that I think is a great place where for-profit

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:23.260
companies can augment the open source software stacks that we have spent so all this time building

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.280
and have really just out-competed the proprietary software stacks.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.380
But of course, doing those two together requires a lot of nuance.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:34.480
I think we haven't yet figured out the right models to be a good actor in the open source

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:38.660
community that we love and love, that's highly principled, and also build a successful business.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:38.940
Yeah.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.460
And that's fun.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.220
And that's what we're excited about experimenting with.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.920
Well, and I think it's about time, right?

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:50.000
The fact that these companies, for lack of a better word, they've started to feel the pain.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.660
They've decided they want to take on open source.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:57.100
They see the value and they're going to move there, but they're like, but there's still these

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.640
problems or these new problems that we don't know how to solve.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:04.060
And so I think there's opportunities for people to come along, knowledgeable in open source stuff

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:10.900
to help give them the support they need so that they can go to the CTO or whatever, say,

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:15.340
we can build on this and here's how we're going to get the support that we need.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.820
Not, you know, Sarah's pretty good with Dask.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.880
She could probably fork it and fix whatever.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.020
Well, they've done that for a while and they're into problems.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:23.760
Yes, I know.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.260
To be clear, though, I think that isn't on them.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.560
You said it's about time as though there's sort of blame.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.660
But I think that blame is on us.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.260
It's on the open source community.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:35.200
Like we needed to learn how to speak corporation.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.400
And like we're learning that.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.720
We're learning how to write legal agreements that they can actually sign.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.200
We're learning how to give them institutions that they can engage with on a peer-to-peer basis.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:44.780
Right.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.980
You know, Ford can't sign a contract with Dask.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:50.560
Dask is not an entity that you can sue if they break your company.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.080
Coiled, you can sue.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:52.880
Like, great.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.100
They can sign a contract with Coiled.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.860
But I think that's really on us.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:00.940
Our community needs to figure out how to build more of those institutions to engage better with

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.560
companies and eventually pull money out of them to feed back the open source innovation

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.300
that we've all been building really successfully over the last decade.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.860
I think another part of the value commercial entities like Coil can add is, as Matt mentioned,

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:18.160
the PyData ecosystem is, for the most part, developed by a huge number of scientists and

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.440
people who are answering scientific questions themselves.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:27.020
So the PyData ecosystem is very good at helping scientists and data scientists answer scientific

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.240
research or industry-based questions.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.900
It doesn't necessarily solve for all the cultural challenges that occur within organizations

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.120
and the enterprise.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.540
Now, I actually haven't...

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:40.340
This isn't as well thought out as I hope it to be in the future.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:45.120
But these types of cultural concerns, I think, are about making sure everyone across an organization

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.980
is happy, such as IT, checking all the boxes from IT that I mentioned before, like network

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:54.560
security, auth, usage controls, making sure management is on board with everything that's happened.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:59.680
So advanced telemetry for management so that they can enable collaboration and make sure

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.940
they're aware of costs and usage and that type of stuff.

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:06.460
So not necessarily solving for the nodes of the network of an organization, but solving for

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.860
the edge as well, I think, is something key that entities like Coil can help solve for.

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:12.520
Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:17.660
I definitely think that the donate button is not the right answer, right?

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:22.600
In the corporate world, making a donation, it doesn't even make sense.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.280
How are the shareholders gaining value from this donation or whatever?

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.700
It just doesn't even make sense.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.220
You can get pizza money pretty easily.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:30.440
Yeah.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.600
But going beyond, that's hard.

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:35.220
But yeah, having a career or a business around it is really tricky.

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:41.000
So I think you're right that the speaking corporate while keeping the ethos of open source

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.940
is pretty important.

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:48.000
So it sounds to me like you guys decided, let me guess, November to December time, you

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.960
decided there's this gap and you guys can start a company, which you founded in February, called

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:59.900
Coil to start addressing some of these problems in the data science, distributed computing world,

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.300
people doing task stuff.

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.180
That's right.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:02.480
All right.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.040
Yeah.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.360
So tell us, what is Coil?

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:10.860
What slice of this enterprise challenge or corporate challenge are you taking on?

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:11.100
Yeah.

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:16.720
So Coil is a for-profit company based around scaling Python or sort of based around Dask,

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.760
whose mission is to make computing accessible, right?

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:24.900
So we care very deeply about enabling individuals to scale out comfortably and also extending that

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.180
capabilities into corporations.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:31.580
We interacted with hundreds of companies who are using Dask and all had more or less the

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:32.120
same needs.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.580
We mentioned them before, all the needs that you have around adopting open source software,

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:40.520
training, support, deployment problems, security off IT issues.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:44.640
We were more or less begged by enough companies to make this thing that we decided to make it.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:44.880
Yeah.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.320
That's a good place to be.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:52.340
Data scientists, as I mentioned before, require a lot of nimbleness and flexibility in the tools

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:52.820
they use.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:57.480
And at the moment, they need to do all types of crazy stuff from, let's say they want to build

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.240
something at scale.

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:02.340
They need to, as we mentioned before, figure out Kubernetes and Docker containers.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:06.640
And then like battle with AWS and all of this stuff.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.720
So do a whole bunch of DevOps-y stuff, right?

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.360
That they shouldn't be doing.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:10.600
Yeah.

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:14.640
And it probably makes their managers nervous because, oh yeah, all we had to do to make

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.900
this work is we created the Kubernetes cluster and then we put the data into this S3 bucket

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.720
and we were able to just talk to it and it was great.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.060
Like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:30.500
What's the access level or what's the publicity versus lockdown state of that S3 bucket?

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.760
Are we going to end up on the news next week because of this?

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.040
There's a story around Pangeo.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.020
We mentioned Pangeo before.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.400
The sort of Earth Science Collaboration Climate Science Group.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.200
That was actually a really eye-opening experience for me because I really started to understand

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.420
what enterprise software looked like.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:48.180
So what we did, I think we were giving a talk at the American Meteorological Society.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.460
And over the weekend, a bunch of us hacked this thing together.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.740
It was JupyterHub on the cloud with Dask enabled.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.600
And so we computed this big data set.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.220
And then we showed that everyone in the room could do the exact same computation on the cloud.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.220
So I did this fantastic thing on stage.

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.240
And then we said, hey, everyone, open up your laptops.

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.800
You can do the same thing too.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.160
And that blew up.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:14.080
I think within about six months, we went from three groups in Columbia University, NCAR,

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.020
and Anaconda to about 50 groups.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.740
So everybody was excited about this.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.840
We sort of revolutionized how we do Earth System Science.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.960
But then that's when the nightmare started.

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.580
Because suddenly we have all these groups trying to use this public access thing.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.000
We had to figure out like, hey, wait a minute, this is costing us money.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.160
So we had to implement user access controls.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.960
Okay, who's whitelist on this thing?

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:34.600
Who can use it?

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.100
Suddenly, there were different groups in different continents who wanted to use different regions on the cloud.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.780
Now we have to have not one Kubernetes cluster, but a dozen Kubernetes clusters.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:45.460
Everyone wanted their own software to be installed.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.760
The oceanographers have a different software stack from the satellite imagery people, it turns out.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.760
And so they were all asking me, hey, can you just pip install this one more package, please?

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.620
And eventually, you can't add all those packages together.

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:59.260
So now we had to make software environment switchers.

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.000
It turns out that no one had...

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.260
We couldn't figure out how to do AWS credentials.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.720
So people couldn't store their data on the cloud.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.280
It was read...

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.040
You could read any data, but you couldn't then transform it and then store it into your own buckets.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.420
And so figuring out auth and passing that around.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:20.040
And then security, it was open for an embarrassing amount of time before Bitcoin folks showed up.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.500
It was all of those problems.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.880
Eventually, I stepped back.

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.120
And as you sort of predicted, all the oceanographers started taking over Kubernetes.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.400
And that was what happened.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:41.660
And that experience really showed me personally all of the challenges around doing this kind of science or data science at scale, both on a technical perspective, but also on a social cultural perspective.

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.760
There's a ton more than just algorithms work to do.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.660
Yeah, it seems so easy just to set it up.

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.980
And then there's just one more thing and one more thing.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:52.800
And eventually, yeah, you've got oceanographers doing Kubernetes, which is fine.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.380
They can do it.

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.680
But you shouldn't have to understand how your car works just to go get groceries, right?

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:57.720
Or to go to work, right?

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.720
If that's not your intent, it should just get out of the way.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:05.300
I mean, some of them then did become auto mechanics as a result, which is a fine career change.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.400
Yeah, absolutely.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.380
If you want it.

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.540
But if you're trying to do something else, you don't want to work on your car.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.220
You just want to get there.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:10.860
Awesome.

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:19.000
Okay, so tell us exactly what is it that Coiled is doing so we can sort of understand where it fits in trying to solve this enterprise, open source business story.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.100
If I want to be your customer, what can I do?

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.900
Is it a SaaS service?

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:26.220
Is it like hosted notebooks?

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:27.340
What do I do?

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:29.180
Yeah, so Coiled sells many things.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:33.600
Mostly, we focus on the Coiled product, which is a hosted Dask solution.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:37.840
So we solve all of the infrastructure problems around hosting Dask.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:42.780
So if you want to, if you're on our beta, for example, you could actually, I invited you just half an hour ago, Mike.

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:48.600
Yeah, and I'm sorry, I didn't get to it quick enough to sign up and play with it, but I wish I had.

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.940
So if you did, you could pip install Coiled wherever you run Python.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:55.660
It could be in a Python session, could be in Jupyter Notebook, could be on the cloud.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:57.640
And then you would ask for a cluster.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.400
You'd say Coiled.cluster.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.800
And that would allocate a bunch of machines for you on the cloud somewhere.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.940
You would then connect to those machines in a super secure, super credentialized, very nice way.

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:09.620
And you'd be off to the races.

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:16.400
So if you start my beta, we sort of try to minimize the time of signing up to running computations on the cloud.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.620
Currently, the number is around two or three minutes.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.900
We can get it down to about one minute, I think.

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.760
Just enough time to make a cup of coffee.

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.080
Just enough time to make a cup of coffee.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:24.580
Yeah.

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:25.320
Yeah.

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:29.840
If you have a Keurig with the pre-made filter thing, if you got to get the coffee out, maybe it won't be nice.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:30.680
Yeah.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.020
So from your perspective, it just looks like Dask.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:34.320
We didn't have a set of Kubernetes.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.180
But there's a bunch of other stuff around that that we manage.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.680
So first, manage Dask clusters.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.040
Second, customizable software environments.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.900
You want to use your favorite software libraries.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:49.480
And we're going to help you manage that between your local environment and also in Docker images on the cloud.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.180
We also help you share that with your colleagues.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:55.180
So often we find a sort of one person who manages software and they share it with other folks.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:58.640
And then third, user management, cost management, and telemetry.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.740
So that coil will help you understand what's going on.

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:06.800
Or more likely, we'll help your boss understand what you're doing and make sure that you don't break the bank.

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.080
Yeah.

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:12.340
I've definitely got to some very high cloud computing bills before.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.040
Although in my defense, I said, this is going to be very expensive.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.300
We should use this other service.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:16.960
No, no.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:19.900
We have a contract in agreement with this cloud service.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:20.940
So we're going to use it.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.340
Then I got a message.

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.120
Why did we spend $15,000 on that last month?

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:25.380
Yeah.

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.520
Because you told me to use it.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.000
It would have been $500 over there.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.680
But these surprises are unwelcome.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:30.980
Yeah.

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:33.100
And so just elevating that to you visibly, right?

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.920
There's a page which shows all the running clusters.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.760
It shows how much they're costing per hour and how much they've cost total.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.700
You can aggregate those costs across users.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.220
You can set policies.

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:45.220
Hey, I mean, by default, if you leave a cluster running, this is a super common mistake.

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.460
We'll just shut it off after 20 minutes for you.

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:51.740
So there's lots of things that you can do that save you a ton of money if you're doing them correctly.

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:58.480
So Coil is just our way of running Python at scale in the cloud in a way that's a bit opinionated.

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:01.540
It is the way that I find to be the best way to run, to run that.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:03.760
And it also allows you to be opinionated as a user.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.260
You can do it from the comfort of wherever you do your data science, right?

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:12.820
So if you like doing it in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebooks or IPython, you can do it all from there.

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:15.260
So we're trying to meet end users where they are.

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.380
So we will spin up all the AWS stuff for you.

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.720
And you don't need to go there.

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:33.560
And I think one of the biggest pain points, which Matt hit the nail on the head with, is making sure that you can move seamlessly from local computation to cluster computation, where your environments and your data are all matched up, which is super exciting.

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:42.140
Maybe I'm doing some work in Jupyter, working with Dask to try to take advantage of the 16 cores that my machine has or whatever.

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:46.100
And at some point, I decide we're going to give it more data.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.280
We're going to productionize it.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.320
And it's going to actually need to be faster or work with more data.

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.900
I can basically switch where I'm talking to.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.860
I can import coil, say, give me a cluster and go here.

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.160
And that's pretty much what that switch looks like.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:52:59.340
Yeah.

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.460
You can run coil from anywhere.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.240
You can run Python.

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.560
In that story, you're actually probably not starting with Dask.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.220
You're probably starting with pandas on a very small sample of data.

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:09.740
In that same notebook, in that same process, you say, hey, wait, it's time to scale up.

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:10.640
Import Dask.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.700
Use Dask locally.

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:13.280
You know, use your 16 cores.

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.680
Say, wait, actually, this is running a little slow.

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:16.940
I want to kick it up a notch.

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:20.000
I want to go to the cloud or go to your local Kubernetes cluster or whatever.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.400
And then, you know, you import coiled, hit a button, and now you're running your computation

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:28.340
elsewhere on some remote cluster of honor machines, all in the same user flow.

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.480
You mentioned before, like, hey, are you hosting notebooks?

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.200
And actually, intentionally, we are not.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:38.540
We do not want to own the user's environment because your user environment is going to look

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.220
so much different from everybody else's.

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.280
Maybe you don't use Jupyter.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.140
Maybe you use PyCharm or VS Code.

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.540
Maybe you're actually just like running this in a cron job.

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.200
We don't want to own everything.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:53.120
We just want to sprinkle in robust, secure parallelism and scalability into your existing

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.120
workflows, right?

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:58.060
So this is, again, in sort of the Dask ethos of invent nothing and being minimally creative.

00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:58.860
Minimal invitation.

00:53:58.860 --> 00:53:59.580
Yeah.

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.500
Minimal creativity.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.020
Yeah.

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:04.320
The principle of minimal creativity.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.060
Yeah.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.900
So you don't have to do very much to switch to using coiled.

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.220
It's a small change.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:13.240
So you talk about the different places I might, like, I could be using JupyterLab, which would

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:13.640
be cool.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.820
I could be using VS Code or PyCharm, and that would be cool.

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:21.820
Another place that seems like it might be really interesting to use this is I'm in a fast

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:26.760
API backend, and I want to answer quick with a lot of data, right?

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.000
It could be, I guess what I'm getting at is like production.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:29.800
Yeah, absolutely.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.200
You can use Coil from anywhere you can use Python.

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.300
What's the story of data?

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:38.140
So, you know, one of the reasons I might switch away from just running Pandas or Dask would

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.580
be I have a lot of data.

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:44.100
At the same time, how do I get the data to you guys, to your clusters?

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:48.020
Because that, like I said, could be the slow thing moving around a cluster.

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:52.400
If you got to, like, get that out of one data center to another, that could even make it worse.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:52.720
Yeah.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:57.200
Well, we often find is that if you have, you know, gigabytes of data on your machine, it's

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.940
more likely that you've already downloaded the data from somewhere else.

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:03.960
You had your data on the cloud or on your local data center, it would have been better

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.880
just not to download it.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:09.820
And so Coil really helps you run your computations in that remote space very comfortably.

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:14.240
So, you know, if you have data on AWS S3, you know, there's no reason to download it, open

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.640
up Coil, and you can just run on the data that's there.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:16.940
Right.

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:21.760
Get an authenticated URL, like a signed URL over to that S3 bucket or something.

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.740
I mean, you already have the URL, right?

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:23.980
Yeah.

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:28.940
I mean, what we do is we scrape your local AWS credentials, generate a secure token, pass that

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:29.800
to all the Coil workers.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.400
So those Coil workers look like you.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:36.780
You then can operate on that data as though you were sitting, again, you have the ergonomic

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:40.420
experience of being on your laptop, but you have the computational experience of being on

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:40.840
the cloud.

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.540
And it feels much more proximate.

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:42.820
Yeah.

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:43.500
Okay.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.360
That's really neat.

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:49.480
Where do these Kubernetes clusters that run my Dask stuff, where do they live?

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:49.780
Yeah.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.200
So there's two answers to that.

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:55.780
One is you might have your own set of machines on-prem, you want to run Coil there.

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.200
This is actually really common today with GPU clusters.

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.760
There's really people buying all the GPU clusters.

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:01.880
They don't really know how to handle them.

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.040
Coil is a great way for that.

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:08.380
But if you're on AWS, so we currently support AWS and Kubernetes going to other clouds whenever

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:09.280
that makes sense for us.

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.260
If you're on AWS, they're running on the cloud.

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:13.580
We actually don't use Kubernetes.

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:19.880
We chose to use Elastic Container Service, ECS, which is like a older, slightly simpler system.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.720
They could be running on our account if you want to use our hosted thing, or we can deploy

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:24.820
it inside of your AWS account.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:25.080
Okay.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:25.640
Yeah.

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:29.660
And I guess if it deploys on your AWS account, you could say, I'd like this to run in the

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:33.480
Bahrain data center or the Sydney one or wherever.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:33.920
Sure.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.320
I mean, we could also do that anywhere.

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.740
You can run like our public version of Coil.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:43.380
So we host a public version, which is designed mostly for individuals to increase data access.

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.000
And that can run on any region.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.820
So because we're using systems like ECS, we don't have to maintain Kubernetes clusters

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:50.200
everywhere.

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.820
We can run your code anywhere AWS is running.

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.860
Can you also run against an arbitrary Kubernetes cluster?

00:56:55.860 --> 00:57:00.980
So like if I have set up a Kubernetes cluster at Ludnode, and I give you the connection and

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.260
credentials to the Kubernetes cluster, could I say run it there?

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:07.860
Yeah, you would want to run Coil very close to that system so that we have the right access

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:08.200
everywhere.

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:08.980
Oh, yes.

00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:09.240
Yeah.

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:09.620
Okay.

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:10.160
Yeah.

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.200
That sounds quite neat.

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:17.940
It's fairly close conceptually to an infrastructure as a service sort of model in terms of like

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:22.280
what I'm buying, what I'm getting, what I'm paying for, but specifically focused on helping

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.400
data scientists not actually care about the infrastructure.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.340
I'm asking those like, what do I pay for?

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:26.500
Right.

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:31.460
Do I pay for like the CPU cycle computation, sort of like a Lambda, like the function call?

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:33.520
Do I, for the machines that are running?

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:37.380
That is a super interesting question for which honestly, I don't have a good answer yet.

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:40.480
We are like talking about this every week right now.

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:45.340
Right now, you either pay, it's free for individuals currently, we're in beta, or like big companies

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:48.060
are signing us some check with some other pricing involved.

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:48.500
Yeah.

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.880
I actually recently wrote a blog post on cloud pricing, which I think is broken in lots of

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.160
ways.

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:52.460
Yeah.

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:56.820
The obvious thing to do is to charge you a surcharge on top of whatever your cloud provider

00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:57.320
charges you.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:00.440
If Amazon charges you a hundred bucks, we'll charge you a hundred bucks too.

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.860
That's kind of like the Databricks model.

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:03.880
Databricks charges about a hundred percent markup.

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.640
AWS charges about like a 40 or 50 percent markup.

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.920
I actually hate this model because it totally misaligns incentives.

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:17.700
So if we do this, then I'm incentivized to make your task workload as inefficient as possible

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.840
and use as many resources as possible.

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:20.660
You know what?

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:24.120
Reserved instances and spot instances, we don't need any of that.

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:30.160
Give me the most expensive flavor of a large three or whatever the machine name is, right?

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:33.900
Like that would be the incentive, which is actually the exact opposite of what you would hope.

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:38.580
It's like if Toyota or Ford were incentivized to make you burn more gas, right?

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:42.160
It's as though like the tar company has got a kickback from all the oil companies for burning

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.220
gas and you'd never get the Prius in that situation or the Tesla.

00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.480
And we want to make the Tesla, right?

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:52.260
We want to make the super sexy, super ergonomic experience that's highly efficient and saves

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:52.960
you money in the long run.

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.280
So we're still thinking about that.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:58.280
If your listeners have thoughts on the right pricing model, we'd love to hear from you at

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.540
hello at coil.io.

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.140
It is tricky.

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:01.700
I don't know.

00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:06.880
I mean, I was just, I'm doing this new project where the video players for my online courses,

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:11.780
I would like, so this is a whole like custom player, just HTML5 and JavaScript, Python.

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:15.900
And I want when you hover over the little scrubber to like change the time, it to show

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.640
you a preview of each thing.

00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:22.440
And I, okay, well, what I can do is I can re-encode all the videos really small and then

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.600
like put a little hidden player and like just set the time and move that around.

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:31.420
It all works beautifully, but I've got 200 hours of high def video that I need to turn

00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:31.860
into that.

00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:35.380
And so I literally sat down and said, okay, well, how much is it going to cost me to feed

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:40.500
that through elastic transcoder at AWS and in bandwidth and get it back and get it.

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:44.200
So I actually have that as those pictures I could show like, all right, that's going to

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:45.200
cost about five or $600.

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.140
All right.

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:50.240
This feature, having the data to back this feature is worth $600 to me.

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:50.840
I'll do it.

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:55.980
But I just think this, this thinking about how do I pay for a thing and the trade-offs is

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:56.840
really interesting.

00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:00.000
Yeah, no, I'm putting on my sales hat for a second too.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.580
Like that is a very clear win where like you need video.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.980
It will give you this much money in sales.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:06.240
Great.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:06.840
It makes sense.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:11.540
When you're talking about accelerating data science in a company, like the value that you're

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.180
providing is so far removed.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:13.620
Yeah.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.840
So like, you know, if I was going to sell you an efficient refrigerator, I would say,

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.980
Hey, look, it's going to save you, you know, $200 in electricity bill over the year,

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.380
over 10 years is $2,000.

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:24.220
Great.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.280
Pay me a thousand dollars.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.620
That's a very clear calculus.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:27.360
Yeah.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.380
But when it's like, Oh yeah, I'm going to help you scale Python.

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.660
That's like not quite as clearly valuable.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.620
We need to get into a longer conversation of like, well, why do you care about Python?

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:35.820
Why do you care about data science?

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.500
How much value does that bring to you?

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.560
What actually are you trying to solve for?

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.680
Oh, you're trying to increase, you know, retention in your customers.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:48.220
Like it's like, you have to get a lot more in depth with your customers to figure out what

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:52.220
the value proposition is of like more ergonomic scaled Python.

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:57.040
You get into things like, well, what if we could get your recommender system, the next

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.600
version into production a month sooner?

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.000
Yeah.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.320
How much money would that get you?

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.240
And what if we could get you answers 100 milliseconds quicker?

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:09.220
How many fewer bouncing users would you have leaving your site?

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:13.640
Like these are, they're meaningful, but they're, they're not as clear cut.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:14.820
So they are interesting discussions.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:15.260
I think.

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:17.400
I think you've raised several important concerns there.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.960
And one in particular is like, there are a whole bunch of companies who have hired lots

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.580
of data scientists.

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.880
Cause that's what you do these days.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.720
And they actually haven't seen the value delivered.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.960
They've got data scientists who are getting, you know, really serious, serious salaries.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:34.840
And the data scientists will recognize the value of code, but the economic buyer in an organization

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.900
will be like, wait a second, we're paying you all this money.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:38.620
Like, why are we paying more for tooling?

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.420
We thought you used all this OSS stuff.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:45.040
So there's a slight mismatch there as well, which is something culturally that we're, we're

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.260
working to figure out as well.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:52.100
Well, I think just put it on my, like I used to work at big company X or whatever thinking

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:58.400
hat, you know, from the people who make the decisions, there's also avoids security leaks

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.280
and downtime.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:05.160
And, you know, there's, there's not just always the positive selling point or the positive advantages.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:11.060
There's the, you know, you were avoiding these three really bad potential outcomes by productizing

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.420
your data science and you can do it quicker.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:14.080
Right.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.660
So these are also valuable.

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:15.920
Yeah.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.620
Now the things that we've seen that work really well so far are what you just said.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.480
I mean, actually the biggest one is Databricks is expensive and they like, they're expensive,

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.180
not in a good way.

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.260
They're expensive because we leave machines on all day.

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:28.160
If it was a better experience, that won't happen.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.300
And so we want that.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.400
We want to reduce our costs.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.780
It must feel really bad to just waste money, right?

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:37.000
To literally just leave it running and not actually even because I, it just took a while.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:37.260
Right.

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:37.540
Yeah.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:42.180
There's what Hugo was talking about of like a common theme we hear about is like, I've got this

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.000
data science team.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.980
They use pandas and Python and PyTorch on a single machine.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.380
I've got like the scalable data engineering team and there's a lot of crosstalk between

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:50.620
them.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:51.620
That's really slow.

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:56.400
And we want to be able to allow our data science team to go directly to scale without having

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.520
to interface with a different team.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.580
Because that communication, just that iteration cycle is just killing our performance.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:05.620
Another common sort of theme is, oops, we bought a bunch of hardware.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:09.660
We bought like, you know, 50 GPU boxes and we have no idea how to use them.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.540
Well, like there's only so many TensorFlow Keras runs we can do.

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:15.360
We've seen like the Dask Rapids XGBoost thing.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.660
We want that.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.740
But like, we just have like a bunch of hardware sitting in a rack somewhere.

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:25.620
Can you help us sell a product to manage that rack for us and give us a lot of utilization,

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.640
a lot of value out of our pre-existing purchase?

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.980
And those are the things that really tend to hit home.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:36.580
Well, I do hope that you guys have a lot of success because I'm always excited to see some

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:43.600
interesting company taking a really powerful open source project and just adding value to

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.280
that space and being successful.

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.740
So it seems like you're on a good track.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.020
Thanks.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:48.560
Yeah.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.860
We've been on the track for a while.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.980
I mean, Dask is sort of unique among open source projects in the Python space.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:55.440
We've always had really good funding.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.180
Like there are a lot of funded Dask developers.

01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:00.600
And it's because we've always been sort of scrambling a little bit to get money.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.540
And this is maybe just the next step in that process.

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:02.840
Yeah.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.320
Cool.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:07.180
We're going a little long in time, but I did want to just ask you really quickly some meta

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:07.720
questions.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:11.620
So are you guys using Coiled to build Coiled?

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:15.720
Is there like, what's the Python inside story, the Coiled Dask inside

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.120
story?

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.400
Right now we're not.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.640
This actually did come up recently.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.840
We actually find ourselves building a lot of conda environments for our users.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.840
And that is actually something that we've got, you know, web backend.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.220
We've got the scalability need.

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:31.100
Dask is like an obvious way to scale that out.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.520
Currently we're using a single machine for that.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.240
Our needs are that big.

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:36.440
But yeah, that would be the next step as a build farm.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.560
And you guys are using Django.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.220
Is that right?

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.800
Sort of the API layer?

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.240
Yeah.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:44.500
So Coiled actually looks kind of like a normal vanilla Python web application.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.240
It's, you know, Django and Postgres and, you know, Amazon ECS, as we mentioned.

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.140
And it's been great.

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.800
It's actually, it's my first time using Django.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.160
I'm like a decade or two late.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:57.800
But it's been fantastic to seeing how much is ready for us out of the box.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.120
So yeah, couldn't be happier.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:04:59.860
Yeah, that's great.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.000
And it sounds like there's a non-trivial team size.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.320
I know a lot of people are saying I'm possibly looking for remote work.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.000
Is that a thing that you guys are doing?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.040
Are you looking for more people?

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.860
Are you kind of steady state until you get a little farther?

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.400
What's the status there?

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:13.680
Yeah.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.220
So Coiled is a fully remote company.

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.020
We're actually born in the era of COVID, which is fun.

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.380
We've always been remote.

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:20.180
We've always worked remotely.

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:20.740
Yeah.

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.400
We're maybe like five or six full-time and two or three part-time right now.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.320
Right now, I think I actually kind of like staying small.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:31.940
We raised a bunch of money, but we're sort of not in a hurry to burn it.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:34.980
By the time this episode airs, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if we're looking for more folks.

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:40.560
If you go to coil.io slash jobs, I think, or just coil.io, we'll have active job listings.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.160
Yeah.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.580
And that's both data science folks and web folks and DevOps people.

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.420
It's a nice group of needs.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:47.820
Excellent.

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:49.700
Well, like I said, really interesting project.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.940
And I hope you guys make a lot of progress with it.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.540
Now, before you get out of here, let me ask you the final two questions.

01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.700
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:58.500
Do you want to go first?

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.120
I use JupyterLab these days.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:00.600
Right on.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.100
Matthew?

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:04.460
So if I write Python code, I'm actually going to give me a cheeky answer.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.300
I'll say GitHub.

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.700
So most of the Python code that I write today is indirect.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.780
I mostly try to nerd snipe other people into writing code.

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:14.220
So maybe this is like the community maintainer's answer.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:14.620
Yeah.

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:17.980
GitHub and I'll say, I'll put in a plug for whereby as well,

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.560
which is my favorite video conferencing tool.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.020
Oh, super.

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:21.380
Okay.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.720
And notable PyPI package.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:27.640
We've already got a pip install desk, pip install coiled.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.180
Right?

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:28.800
Those are good ones.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.820
But, you know, something like, oh, this is really cool.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.380
It's not super well known.

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.740
Maybe people should check out X.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.600
I'll point to Napari, which I mentioned earlier.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:36.940
Yeah.

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.840
The search image viewer.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:38.320
It's really cool.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.600
It's actually fun seeing a rich client application written in Python.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.020
Didn't know that was cool anymore.

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:47.540
I'll point to Snorkel, which I mentioned earlier, which is for weak supervision.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.120
And it helps you build training data.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:53.200
I think training data is one of the biggest challenges we have in the ML space.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.900
Like I think scale AI raised a hundred million dollars last year or something like that.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:01.040
And they still hand label data for people.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:05.160
Like they're called scale AI, but they hand label data.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.080
ML Turk.

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:06.620
Yeah.

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.980
Mechanical Turk is still like a huge thing.

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:09.200
Right?

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:13.140
So any ways we can figure out to do this programmatically is really cool.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:19.980
And the Snorkel API allows domain experts to come in and write using basic functions and decorators,

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.800
heuristics for labeling data, which is super cool.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.720
That's what I'll shout out today.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.080
All right.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:24.500
Super cool.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.260
I guess I'll throw in as well.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:27.420
Missing no.

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:33.860
Missing N-O, which is a quick visualization for missing data and like pandas and stuff like that.

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:34.960
Ask what's missing.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.160
You'll get a cool little graph.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:40.500
Like usually if the state is missing, also, I don't know, phone is missing.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:41.400
Like all sorts of cool stuff.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.520
So people can check that out as well.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.180
All right.

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:44.620
So final call to action.

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.160
People are interested in Dask.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.300
They're interested in Coiled.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.760
They want to parallelize some things.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.640
What do you guys tell them?

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.660
I would love.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.780
So I've got a call to action for Coiled.

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.360
Matt may have one for Dask.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.640
All the features we've just described of Coiled in rapid development.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:03.540
And we'd love to involve anybody who likes to break things at scale in this development cycle.

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:06.020
So go to Coiled.io, sign up for our beta.

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:10.220
And take our product for a test drive, crash it, and let's figure out how to build it together.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:12.620
So I'd love to involve you in that conversation.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:12.920
Excellent.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.360
Matthew?

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.520
I'll have you go with that one.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.320
I'm actually going to...

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:16.780
Sorry, I'm going to go out of thinking this.

01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:17.780
Mention one thing on that.

01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:21.160
It is super fun to run a beta.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:25.340
As an open source software developer, I'm used to never seeing how people use my software.

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:31.620
And running a beta on a public service, there's a bunch of creepy spyware I can put on our website,

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:35.080
which tells me exactly what you've done, which we'll take off at some point.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:38.880
It is amazing getting this kind of immediate feedback.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.120
Yeah.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.000
A different level of visibility, right?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.140
Into what people use and telemetry and whatnot, right?

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.660
So yeah, I'll just echo Hugo.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.160
Go plan with a beta.

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.460
It's super fun, mostly for us, but also for you.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.720
And yeah, you can play with that on the cloud.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.420
It's cool.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:55.060
Is there a free thing I can do?

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.080
Everything is free right now.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:56.320
Yeah.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:56.600
Yeah.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.740
We'll limit how much you can spend, because that's the features that we care about.

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:03.680
But yeah, I think we just limit you to 100 cores at a time.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.980
So you can't go totally wild, but you can do lots of fun things.

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:07.200
Just 100 cores, huh?

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:07.720
That's awesome.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.860
Just 100 cores.

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:10.280
Yeah, that's really cool.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:10.860
All right.

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:12.980
Well, you guys, thanks again for being on the show.

01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:14.180
Good luck with Coiled.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:18.180
It's a nice, natural extension of Dask, I think.

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.800
So excited to see you doing it.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.000
Yeah.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:20.500
Thanks, Michael.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:21.560
Go start for the beta.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.640
Thanks so much for having us on the show, Michael.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.520
It's always fun.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.000
Yeah, you bet.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.600
Bye, guys.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:29.540

Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:11:02.460
I really appreciate it.

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:32.440
Thank you.
