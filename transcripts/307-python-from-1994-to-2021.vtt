00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.420
Python has changed a lot since its inception 30 years ago.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.240
On this episode, you'll meet Paul Everett and Barry Warsaw.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.160
They've both been involved with Python since the very first Python conference,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.680
called SpamOne even.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.460
We discuss how it's changed, but also how so many of the ideas and pressures

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.580
from the very early days are still playing out in 2021.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.820
I'm sure you'll enjoy all the stories and the reminiscing.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.380
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 307, recorded March 4th, 2021.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.740
Beautiful is better than ugly.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.020
Explicit is better than implicit.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.200
Simple is better than complex.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.120
Complex is better than complicated.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.300
Flat is better than nested.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.500
Sparse is better than dense.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.600
Readability counts.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.960
The Zen of Python, as a song.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.920
That's so smooth and cool, isn't it?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.740
That song is by Barry Warsaw, one of the two guests on this episode.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.000
We'll talk to him a bit about it during the introduction.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.160
And if you want to catch the entire song, listen at the very end.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.900
I'll put it there.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.940
You can listen to it as part of this MP3.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.580
And I'll also link to his lyric version he has on YouTube.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.940
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.740

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.620
It really helps support the show.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.360
One quick announcement before we get to the interview.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.720
We'll be giving away five tickets to attend PyCon US 2021.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.740
This conference is one of the primary sources of funding for the PSF.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.100
And it's going to be held May 14th to 15th online.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.820
And because it's online this year, it's open to anyone around the world.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.020
So we decided to run a contest to help people, especially those who have never been part of PyCon before, attend it this year.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.380
Just visit talkpython.fm/PyCon 2021 and enter your email address.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.080
And you'll be in the running for an individual PyCon ticket.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.820
Compliments of Talk Python.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.740
These normally sell for about $100 each.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.800
And if you're certain you want to go, I encourage you to visit the PyCon website, get a ticket,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.260
and that money will go to support the PSF and the Python community.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.280
Congratulations to Zane Dax.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.240
Zane won the first of one of these five tickets that we're giving away during this contest.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.400
There are still more chances to win, so be sure to register.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.020

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.000
You'll be in the running to win a ticket.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.120
Now, let's get on to that interview.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.460
Barry and Paul, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.360
Thanks for having us.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.460
Thanks for having us.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.280
Yeah, it's super to have you both here.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.920
Now, Paul, you've been on the show before, and we've talked about a few things.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.440
Barry, I don't think I've had you on Talk Python, but we had both of you on Python Bytes at a live PyCon.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.120
You guys remember that?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.040
People got in a room.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.620
Oh, yeah.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.760
No one was, like, frightened when you would get somewhat near them.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.560
They wouldn't run away.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.420
It was great.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.340
Good times.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.360
Those were good times.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.760
That was fun.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.440
A lot of energy.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.460
Back before you did live virtually.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.600
Is that what you call this?

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.840
Yeah.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.640
Vlive?

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.780
Something like that, yeah.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.160
Yeah, that was really cool.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.960
I mean, we had that at the PyCharm booth, actually.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.380
We had, like, the whole broadcast thing going on there.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.960
It was a lot of fun.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.440
Yeah.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.280
We'll do it again.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.080
It really was.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.020
We'll get back to this.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.840
I mean, I don't know how you two feel about it, but to me, PyCon and similar events, that's like my geek holiday.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:47.900
I get away and I get to learn stuff and make professional connections, but I also get to see all my friends from all around the world and just share stories and have a beer with them when I would just never otherwise see them.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:04:00.780
Yeah, I was just talking about this recently, of course, missing PyCon in person, but I think what I learned, for me at least, the hack of PyCon, which was realizing that all the great talks were online.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:14.600
And there was still a few that I would go to, but where all the real value for me at PyCon was, was talking to people, the hallway conversations, the energy and the synergy of ideas.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.040
Oh, you're, you're looking into that.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.100
I'm looking into this.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.620
Look how that stuff goes together.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.800
So that to me was really the value of PyCon in person.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.040
Yeah, I totally agree.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.180
That's why I would go as well.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:34.660
My best part is walking down the hallway with Barry and watching thousands of people come up and say, oh my God, Barry, I love you so much.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.540
No.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.960
Just, I mean, every continent, Barry is loved.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.080
Oh my gosh.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.120
And I'm not, this is not my normal BS.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.700
This is actually literally true.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.160
Like real BS.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.120
Yeah, that's fantastic.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:58.820
You know, it's really funny because walking around with Guido and Guido is the rock star of the Python community in a lot of ways, of course.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.920
And I always felt like I was playing my bass player role in Python too.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.160
It was great, you know?

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.080
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.940
I'm just back here doing my thing.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.700
That's perfect.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.700
That's exactly right.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.040
Yeah, a beautiful supporting role right there.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.880
Yeah, exactly.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.780
To bring the music on.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.420
So, fantastic.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.500
Well, we're going to get back to these conferences and these get-togethers.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.380
I know we will.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.760
And I'm even going to try to get the most out of the online events.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.340
Like I register for PyCon and I'm looking forward to it.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.900
I'm going to try to make the most of it.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.800
Now, before we get into the main topic, maybe you guys can tell everyone a little bit about yourselves.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.720
Barry, how did you get into programming in Python?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.480
Oh, well, I got into Python in 1994.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.980
I had just been hired at CNRI.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:47.120
And we were starting at this project called the Nobot Programming Environment or something like that.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.440
Okay.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.060
What was that?

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:58.860
These were little software agents that were supposed to travel around the internet and get a little bit of information here, package themselves up, move over there, do some action over here.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.300
And move around to a bunch of different nodes.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.380
This was an important part of the CNRI's digital library initiative at the time.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:16.060
And Roger Massey, who was my colleague at CNRI, we were using Next Step and Objective-C and sort of doing that.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:22.440
And then I had worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology earlier in my career.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.260
And I still had friends there.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:33.520
And one of the friends, of course, Paul knows, Ken Manheimer, who is the unsung hero for where Python is because he crops up in so many places.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.240
Every Emacs RC file on the internet goes back to Ken.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.960
Yeah, right.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.820
Exactly.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.400
I haven't talked to Ken in a long time, but I hope he's doing well because Ken's a great guy.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:55.680
So Ken was still at CNRI and he forwarded to me an email saying, hey, this Dutch guy's coming over to talk about this language that he created.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.280
He's bringing a crazy language with no semicolons.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.360
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.220
So we kind of pulled down Python at the time and played with it and went, oh, this is pretty interesting.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.100
So it was close to where we lived.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:16.020
So we just cruised up to Gaithersburg, Maryland and spent three days at the first workshop, which, of course, Paul was at as well.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.060
He can talk about his experience.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:25.740
And we just like totally fell in love with Python, really resonated with Guido and what he was doing with the language.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.740
And long story short, ended up hiring Guido and bringing him over to the States.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.120
Oh, fantastic.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.040
Worked with him at CNRI for eight years, I think.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.420
Now, an important part of the story, Barry, is CNRI meant something.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.880
Yeah.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.780
It's kind of viewed itself.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.760
I think it viewed itself as kind of the steward of the internet.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:53.380
Well, of course, CNRI was run by Bob Kahn and Vince Cerf at the time and ran the IETF meetings, which, of course, are all the internet.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.080
Yes.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.920
Internet RFCs and things like that.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.580
And it was a not-for-profit research shop.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:08.760
So it really was kind of well-positioned to be Python's home for all those years because there wasn't any sort of commercial aspect to it.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.780
It was all not-for-profit.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.440
And it was really – Python was a really good piece of technology, I think.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.060
And I think CNRI was a really good home for Python for many of those years.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.620
Yeah.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:25.220
It was a good breath of fresh air in terms of compared to C at the time or this fledgling Java thing that some company made up.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:25.660
Yeah.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.100
A comment I was going to make on that is, Barry and I give this talk, Python 1994.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.020
We wear our shirts.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.220
We didn't wear our shirts tonight.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:32.780
No.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.380
Although.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.460
And each time I kind of learn, I see it, I learn a little bit more.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.160
Oh, I love it.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.800
Level of Python.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.480
Yeah.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.480
Sorry.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.660
I kind of said some Python.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.460
I'm sure you have every shirt.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:45.980
Yeah.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.760
But there's kind of this – it's a narrow run thing, the sequence of dominoes.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:57.400
And the fact that you were at CNRI and then CNRI was a place to go, if it would have been some other place, who knows?

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:04.400
If you wouldn't have been at NIST before you landed at CNRI in the Michael McLeod connection at NIST, who knows?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.900
So that's an interesting point.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:13.600
As much as you try to plan your life out and guide it in directions, these little happenstance experiences are sometimes the biggest goals.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.060
And, you know, it came out to California a few months before I joined CNRI.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.980
And I interviewed with a company called Lucid.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.520
I don't know how many people remember Lucid.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.180
Oh, yeah.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.060
They had this nice compiler suite, and they were using Emacs.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.160
They had a fork of Emacs that they were using as their UI.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.360
And that was a version of Emacs that I was using at the time.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:44.280
So I came out here, interviewed, and ended up not moving out here, which was also another one of those fortuitous events in my life, certainly.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:50.820
Because then just a couple months later, I ended up at CNRI, and then a few months after that, met Guido and just took off from there.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.520
So you just never know.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.120
Yeah, and that's such an interesting time.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.320
You know, Paul talked about being like the shepherd of the internet, right?

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:03.620
1994, well, a year before, that's when the graphical web HTTP whole, that whole story came around.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.160
And I remember seeing Mosaic the first time and just seeing what the web was.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.740
And I was supposed to go to like a physics class or something, like an evening physics lecture.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.020
And I'm just like, I'm skipping my class.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.640
I cannot believe that this is a real thing.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.820
I had been on Gopher and Archie and all of these things and telling it.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.540
And I'm like, I'm seeing like entire new world.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.040
It was so powerful to me to see that.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.700
So like, that's like in the same time that all this is happening.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.140
Yeah, it was a pretty magical time, I think.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.060
Yeah, it was.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:31.960
It absolutely was.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.980
Let me just highlight a couple of things real quick before we move off your introduction.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.900
You were interviewed as part of this really interesting story, Python is Eating the World,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.180
How One Developer Side Project became the hottest programming language on the planet.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:43.440
planet.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.860
So that was a really cool article.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.500
I remember that.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.200
And then...

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.640
Hey, Barry, you look good in that photo, man.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.080
Yeah.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.380
Yeah.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.420
His colleague does.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:56.760
And then another thing that was really interesting was the Pep 8 song that Leon Sandoi recently

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.780
released came out.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.220
And I was like, oh, what a cool, clever idea.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:05.160
And then I realized today that you wrote and recorded The Zen of Python as a song.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.740
Yeah.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.160
Just nine months.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.120
At least you published it to SoundCloud nine months ago.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.500
That's a really cool song.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.280
I'll share the link with people so they can check that out for sure.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:13.720
Yeah.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.760
And there is a...

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.200
I did a quote unquote lyric video where I had basically did an iMovie.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.500
I took that soundtrack and I put the Zen of Python lyric...

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:23.840
You know...

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.020
Yeah.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.860
I call them lyrics, but...

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.660
Which I think we have to give a lot of credit.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.800
Other people call it import this or something like that.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.040
I don't know.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:30.280
Yeah.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:30.520
Yeah.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.180
Import this.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:36.840
Which, of course, comes from Tim Peters, who even predates me in the Python land.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.960
And Paul, too, I guess.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.100
I think Tim was involved in Python almost from the beginning.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.820
And he was, of course, our colleague as we were in Python labs and so on and so forth.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.480
And Tim wrote The Zen of Python.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.000
Yeah.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.540
It's really neat.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.940
I think that's an interesting set of principles there.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.680
All right, Paul.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.160
How about you?

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.300
This is the how I get into Python question?

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:57.800
Yeah.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.580
Maybe programming.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.600
I mean, you told the story a bit before, but how did you get into this whole programming

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:01.940
thing?

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:08.500
Cool program at school where we had a lab that had a bunch of stuff, the Commodore PETS, the

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:08.980
RS-80.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:16.800
But the one that really stuck out to me was a deck teletype connected to a mainframe at

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.620
the university 200 miles away.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.080
You probably didn't even have to log in to connect to it, right?

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.960
Exactly.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.320
Yeah.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.480
You start typing, man.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:23.960
Exactly.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.640
You just connect.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.980
I got my own port.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:26.360
We're good.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:26.980
Yeah.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.200
And so a modem.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:33.980
And what freaked me out was this modem is connected to the mini computer or mainframe

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.380
or whatever.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:41.340
But if you called this phone number, this phone from this phone five feet away, it was a long

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:41.880
distance call.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.000
What's going on with that?

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.220
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Square.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.180
Do you run or want to build a web application that sells products or services?

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.040
Building a successful online business is the stuff that dreams are made of.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.940
But accepting payments and handling credit cards with all the various regulations is a common

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.660
stumbling block.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.860
But not with Square's payment API.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.900
With Square, your Python web app can easily take payments.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.100
You'll seamlessly be able to accept debit and credit cards as well as Square gift cards.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.720
Let your users pay with their digital wallets.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.520
Square works with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and MasterPass all in one go.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:25.380
Your API includes PCI compliance, end-to-end encryption, dispute management, and fraud detection.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.640
Build your online payment form in three steps with Square payment SDKs.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.260
Step one, create a new Square API application.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
Step two, add Square's payment form to your checkout flow.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.140
Step three, use Square's API to charge the card.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.600
So get started building your business on Square.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.480
Just visit talkpython.fm/square or click the link in your podcast player's show notes.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.120
That's talkpython.fm/square.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.560
And that used to matter.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.880
That's also a thing that I kind of forgot, right?

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.800
It was expensive.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.800
You're like, oh, there's this really sweet BBS that's got this information I want, but it's

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.540
in another state.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.960
So we can only talk to it for so long.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.320
And I hope you got 9,600 baud and not 300 baud or whatever you're going to get.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:06.760
Crazy.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:12.780
Briefly, my Python origin story is the Navy officer working in Pensacola for a great guy named Jim

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.180
Glenn.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:20.340
93, we did www.navy.mil, a source of infinite funny stories.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.140
Some of them true.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:26.400
And there was a scripting, you know, it was pre-CGI, but the same idea.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.620
You fork, standard out, standard in.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:34.560
And some of the people were writing their web server stuff, dynamic stuff in C, not going

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:34.940
to do that.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.660
Some were doing it in Bash, not going to do that.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.580
So Pearl, I have this vivid memory.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.760
This story is true.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.580
Vivid memory of going to the bookstore, going to the computer shelf.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.460
It wasn't a section.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.660
Get in the Pearl book.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.340
I can remember where I was staying.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.620
I'm like, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.780
Oh, hell no.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.020
Put it back on the shelf.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.160
And there was this downloadable tutorial for this thing called Python.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.900
And it was a scripting language.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.940
It wouldn't reach for me.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.680
And damn if that thing wasn't written for my brain.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.660
It was like perfectly the entrance for me into this.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.340
That's awesome.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.720
Yeah, I think a lot of people, Python connects right away.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.240
Yeah.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.500
It depends on your history.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:20.340
If you've been writing C languages for a long time, you have to sort of break the paradigm,

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:20.820
right?

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.020
But you'll get there.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:26.740
It's funny that Paul talks about Pearl because I have the classic Pearl book.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.980
And I was into Pearl and Tickle.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:29.740
And I know...

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.460
This is the camel book?

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.280
You want to ask about this?

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.280
The camel book.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.240
And it was totally dog-eared.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.020
And the spine was destroyed.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.840
Because I could never keep Pearl in my head.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.160
And I think I have the first Python book.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.500
And it's like pristine.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.580
Nice.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.760
Python just kind of fits in your head.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.160
That's exactly true.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:49.560
Yeah.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.480
Yeah, exactly.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.140
That's awesome.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:51.580
All right.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.280
Before we move off your introduction, Posh, I want to give a quick shout out to two things

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.080
that you and I did recently that was fun.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.180
People might also like.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:03.700
So you and I did when I got my Apple Mac Mini M1 back in December, you and I did a nice

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.200
walkthrough sort of exploration.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.660
Like, well, can you...

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.700
How does Python work over here?

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.760
Can you run Jupyter Notebooks?

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.760
What's the ripple like?

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.260
And just we compared a bunch of stuff.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.560
And that was a whole lot of fun.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.020
So I'll link to that as well as we also did a...

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.400
Over at JetBrains, where you work, we did a cool webcast.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.300
Let's build a fast modern Python API with FastAPI.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.340
And we just built that out.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:29.820
If I may say, Michael set the all-time JetBrains record for webinar attendance.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.280
It lasted one month, but you held it for a month.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.260
Hey, that's awesome.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.380
I mean, so cool.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.280
Thanks for having me over there.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.280
But now I want to take you all on a journey.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.900
I want to start you to take us on a journey.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.900
Check this out.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.140
Oh, you guys remember that?

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.920
Oh, yeah.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.940
PSA.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.440
All right.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.740
So what we have on the screen here, folks, is I couldn't get any earlier than 1997,

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.220
but it's the 1997 python.org.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.400
And it's got the original Python logo, which is like one of those light board type things.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.420
And it talks about what Python is.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.360
So Python is this interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.720
And it provides an extraordinary combination of clarity and versatility.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.420
It is free.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.720
It runs on Unix, PC, Macintosh, and others.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.760
And it's really interesting that it describes itself as free and non-proprietary, right?

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.240
Like even it almost predates this kind of Zen of open source side.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.260
It's just we built this thing.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.440
He doesn't want it to be corporate.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.600
I don't want it to be commercial.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.160
How can we build it as a community?

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.700
But so it was really blazing that trail, right?

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.540
It's pretty funny.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.700
I see the sixth international Python conference there and Grail.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.060
That's a story.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.160
That is a story.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:38.860
That's an episode.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.340
Oh, yeah.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.460
The final version of Grail 0.3 is out.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.040
Incredible.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:44.980
What's Grail?

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.880
Grail was a completely Python-based web browser.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.400
Okay.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.060
That I think it was we used Tickle TK to render.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:59.500
The interesting story there, at least the way I remember it, so it could all be lies.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:17:59.960
Who knows?

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:07.740
Was kind of fit in with this notion of these software agents because we had this idea.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:14.680
I think it was around the time of sort of Java in the browser, but I don't remember exactly

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.300
the timing.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.840
General Magic was the ones that were really pushing the mobile code thing in agents.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:20.660
Yeah.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.940
So the idea was we wanted to be able to run Python in the browser, right?

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:31.260
And Bob had come, the way I remember it, at least, Bob had sort of had this idea about

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:36.560
the same time and came to Guido and myself and the team and said, wouldn't this be a great

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.520
thing if we had Python running in the browser?

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.840
And Guido was pretty much like, yeah, you want to see it?

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.980
You know, he had already done it, right?

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:49.660
So right about the time Java in the browser was happening, you know, Python in the browser

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:50.200
working.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.700
So that's what Grail was.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.260
Wow.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:52.820
How interesting.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.400
I think that even predates JavaScript.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.360
Yeah, I think it does, actually.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.260
I think that's 97 or something like that.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.480
I can't remember exactly, but how interesting.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.820
I can't tell you how much time I wasted trying to get tables working in Tickle TK inside of

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.740
that Grail thing.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.840
A layout engine in Tickle TK.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.400
Yeah.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:10.880
Oh.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.740
Oh my goodness.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.420
It was brutal.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:13.600
Yeah.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:13.640
Yeah.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.600
A couple of thoughts on what you guys are saying.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.580
John Sheehan says, just fits in my brain.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.960
It's probably the most quoted reason people like Python.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.040
And Jessica is pretty impressed at the age of this page.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:23.220
Yeah.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.660
That's like, think about how easy it used to be to do web design.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.020
You're like, okay, I can bold that section and we'll put a horizontal line.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.080
Like, wow, you're a designer.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.940
That's incredible.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.000
It was so bad.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.600
It was so bad that it was like this opportunity.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.020
Really, really, really interesting.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.720
So let's jump back there.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.180
What other, we talked about some of these technologies, Perl and Tickle and so on.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:50.000
And the reason you guys chose 1994 is this is when the first I'd done conference or workshop

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.880
happened, right?

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.100
You kind of partially mentioned that before, yeah?

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.500
Yeah.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:59.300
I mean, that's certainly when I met Paul and Jim Fulton and a lot of, you know, Skip Montanaro

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.060
at the time, Stephen Majewski, right?

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:03.660
Yeah.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.540
Robin Friedrich.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.040
We can go through the names, yeah?

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.180
Robin Friedrich.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.680
I think there was only 20 of us at that workshop.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.200
Yeah.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.180
That's what I was going to ask.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.260
You know, I go to PyCon and it's selling out the Cleveland Convention Center and who knows

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.280
what it would have done in Pittsburgh if that ever happened.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.200
But it's a really big gathering.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.480
Like my voice is gone.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.040
My legs are tired from walking.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.120
And maybe it takes me multiple days to get through the expo floor, right?

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.880
Probably wasn't like that in the first one, right?

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.360
It was...

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.220
No, I mean, I joke about it when we heard we had room for 20 people.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.580
We're like, wow, what were we going to do with all this room?

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:43.220
You know, in this closed windowless office building in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:43.940
Yeah.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:44.460
Yeah.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.460
We had people...

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:51.040
I won't mention any names, but there was at least one person who I can think of who said,

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.240
you can't even mention that I'm here, that we use Python because...

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.400
Oh, I know who that is.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.140
Because it's a competitive advantage, right?

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:00.560
Like...

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.020
Interesting.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.340
It was just like the fact that they were using Python was a secret.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.060
So times have really changed quite a bit.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.780
But it's kind of an important point that Barry and I try and talk about in the talk is, what

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.640
was it like?

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.180
Did you know...

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.560
Did we know then that it was a thing?

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.620
Are there things from later in Python that you can trace back to that origin story?

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.340
It's kind of an interesting thought exercise.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.100
You don't want to romanticize the past.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.600
But at the same time, I think, Barry, you and I have kind of a similar impression about

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.100
kind of how things went down there.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:37.880
Yeah, I mean, again, it's all these little lucky changes, twists and turns in life and

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.580
technology and things like that.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.220
But I think it's really clear.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:47.540
And I did a talk in 2018 for BayPiggies, which is the Bay Area.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.240
And I went back and I tried to download as many versions of Python.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.200
I couldn't build a single one of them on any modern OS without changes.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:56.700
Wow.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.420
But I went through all the change logs and the what's new and things like that.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.440
And you can really trace the history of the language all the way through.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.140
You can see the thread from even before I...

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:13.200
You know, I think it was like version 0.91 is the first one you can pull down.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:20.620
And you can really see how Guido's vision for the language that he wanted to put out there

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.000
is still alive today.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.280
It's still really...

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.140
Even through Python 3, through the type hinting, any new feature you want to talk about, the

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.360
flavor, the sense of Python still.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:31.920
Yeah.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.700
It's a thrill.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.580
It feels really continuous.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:40.380
One of the similar thought paths I like to go down or analogies I like to draw is, well,

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.780
JavaScript came along and did some stuff.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.720
And then they said, well, let's add things like type hints and async.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.800
And let's make this TypeScript language.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.640
In my experience going down that path was, oh, JavaScript is kind of easy.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.940
Why is it so complicated now?

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:57.180
There's all these like dependencies and other libraries and libraries of libraries and left

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:57.860
padding things.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.920
And then it got to TypeScript.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.560
And I'm like, this is a really frustrating addition because 80% of the time it's like, wow, what a

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.100
cool addition.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.000
Oh, wait, this thing I need to use doesn't have some right type definition.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.940
So I can't...

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.540
How come it won't let me use this thing?

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:16.940
And somehow Python has managed to grow through the years with those types of additions without

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.040
going like, oh, why does it hate me now?

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.360
Like, why do I have to fight it so much?

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.240
You know, it just...

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.240
You can kind of...

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.600
Actually, I think more broadly, this is like a really powerful aspect of Python is that you

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.560
can use and understand and take as little or as much of it as makes sense for you.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.400
Like, you can be super effective with a very partial understanding of Python, right?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.820
I know how to import modules, call some cool functions.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.240
I didn't have to write a method.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.400
I just put these 10 lines in here and look what amazing thing I did, where so many languages

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.220
don't do that.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.500
And I think that that's a really powerful aspect that it has these cool features, but they're

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.760
not in your face like a lot of languages.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.820
Yeah, Paul may have additional thoughts, but I think you're onto something there because

00:23:54.820 --> 00:24:00.220
I've always considered Python the type of language that really scales with whatever you're

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.120
trying to do, right?

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.740
If I'm just going to throw a...

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.780
You know, I just need a script.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.740
I have this...

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.960
This is kind of a funny thing.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:12.960
I was upgrading one of my machine, my Macs to Big Sur, and I lost all of my notes for...

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.800
Like, I use the Notes app religiously.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.940
And...

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.020
Right.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.280
And it should go through iCloud, but because it's Apple, sometimes it doesn't.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.740
Yeah, sometimes it just doesn't work.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:27.420
So I actually did a little bit of searching, found the SQLite database and played around with

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.860
the schema, try to figure things out.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:35.160
And then I wrote a little Python script, 25, 30 lines to just like suck it out of the SQLite

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:35.500
database.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.640
And I restored all my notes.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.560
So even at that level, Python's awesome.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:46.880
But then you can build huge applications in Python, especially with typing, type hinting.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.080
It just scales.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.920
Python just scales with whatever you want to do.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.320
Yeah.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.520
And there's a lot of languages that go to that far end, but you've got to start somewhere

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.360
in the middle, right?

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.400
You've got to understand nullable optional types.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.180
And no, you can't set that to nil because it's just like all that kind of stuff, right?

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.200
Eventually you might want that, but you shouldn't have to have it all the time.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.520
Yeah.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.420
And I think that's the magic.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:08.800
Yeah.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.520
My comment on that is, I guess one of the last talks I gave was at PyConnor, which was a

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.260
wonderful conference.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.920
And I was actually giving Python 1994 there as a keynote.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:24.080
And right when I got to the part about spam too, when we first heard of Java, no kidding,

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.820
thunder.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:30.300
It was like the most awesomely theatrical thing.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.540
Perfect timing.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.120
You are a dramatic speaker.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:34.660
That was good.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.040
Yeah.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.340
So I've got this look on my face like, okay, you won't believe this.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:46.380
But what they told me was at the meetups, like 70% of the people coming to the Python

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.240
meetups just came to Python less than a year ago.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:54.100
And if you look at the Python developer survey, which you were talking about in the most recent

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.000
Python bites.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.440
Yeah.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.320
I was going to say there's some company, it's called JetBrains.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.040
They did this survey.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.980
And it's like 150% of the Python community arrived yesterday.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.500
Yeah.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.800
And let's face it, where are they coming from data science?

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.100
And let's face that, why are they coming to Python?

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.140
Because Michael, what you just said, jump right in, start coding.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.640
You don't have to eat your vegetables.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.520
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.340
I'm trying to find this for us here and find the exact.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.800
But actually, I will try to tie it back to our alleged agenda.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.640
We have an agenda.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.240
We're going to get to it.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.920
Who were we fighting in 1994?

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.480
Scripting languages.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.240
It was Perl and Tickle and then, and then, and then Python.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.700
And we were all lumped into this toy language scripting and the grownups would come back

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.480
later and reprogram it all in a serious language and stuff like that.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.480
And wow, how did that turn out?

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:43.840
Yeah.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:49.280
I think there's a lot of special stuff about this entry level that is, to me, it feels almost

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.980
like, like a stealth way to capture people's excitement and energy around programming.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.380
It's like, ah, I'm not a programmer, but I've heard that there's some cool libraries for

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.340
working with whatever I do, biology, chemistry, whatever, economics.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:05.020
And if I just import this and do these three lines, like I'll do something really amazing.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.240
And probably that person's colleagues are like, wow, you were a wizard.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.000
How did you do this?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.360
Like, well, it was like these four lines, right?

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.740
And they just slowly make it a little better and a little better.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.320
And they never think of themselves as programmers.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:19.600
And then like two years later, they're building machine learning, put in production behind Flask or

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.100
FastAPI.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.160
And they're like, how did I get here?

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.260
Like, I just never even knew I was going to be here.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:23.460
Right.

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:27.280
And I think that's the magic is you just, you don't get ejected.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.780
It's not like, well, I made it sort of this far.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.220
Now it's time for a grownup language.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.200
Go learn C++ and be real now.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:32.440
Right.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.700
Like that doesn't often happen.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.900
Here's the part you're talking about, Paul.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:41.200
That, again, the fact that like Python scales from throwaway scripts to huge applications,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.000
it also really scales to the experience of the person using it.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.660
So it appeals to non-programmers who are just trying to get their other stuff done.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.040
Right.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.820
And they need to do some programming.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.740
But it also somehow also appeals to professional programmers who are building like production

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.420
quality software.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.600
It just resonates with both those audiences.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.540
Like what was M. Peters doing before Python?

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.000
Oh, yeah.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.060
Writing compilers for Cray computers.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.040
Right.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.160
Right.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:11.580
Right.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.940
You got a problem harder than that?

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:13.660
No, I don't think so.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.600
Well, one of the things I think is interesting is I was just reminiscing about talking to

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.860
Momotou Shemi four or five years ago about Python and the enterprise and how it was kind

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:29.140
of a really interesting story that big companies that were not just tech giants, but boring like

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.520
insurance companies and stuff.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.300
And I use that in a positive sense right now.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.020
They were also using Python in really interesting ways.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.780
Like Bank of America has like a Python project with 5,000 Python developers and millions of

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.280
lines of code.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.880
And like that kind of stuff is, I think, at least when I would talk to people, it felt like

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.120
that was noteworthy to have those conversations five years ago.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.520
And now it's just like, well, yeah, we are.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.560
Like who would not?

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.700
It'd be insane not to do this.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.560
Most companies at least have like a data science wing or something that's all about Python.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.920
Project that from 1994 forward.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.380
Like how did that feel to see it that way now?

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.020
And what was the perspective back then?

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.600
Again, this is, I think, the magic secret sauce of Python.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:09.680
Right back then it was CGI and web programming and things like that.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.680
And Python was perfectly suited for that.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.380
And now we're fast forward 30 years or about.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:21.200
And the domains that are sort of the hot things that everybody needs to be able to do, Python

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.400
just is malleable.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.860
It just adapts to that environment.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.760
You can find all the details at talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.700
Linode has data centers around the world with the same simple and consistent pricing, regardless

00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.500
of location.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.340
Just choose the data center that's nearest to your users.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:08.500
You'll also receive 24, 7, 365 human support with no tiers or handoffs, regardless of your

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.040
plan size.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.240
You can choose shared and dedicated compute instances, or you can use your $100 in credit

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:19.260
on S3 compatible object storage, managed Kubernetes clusters, and more.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.740
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:26.420
Visit talkpython.fm/Linode or click the link in your show notes.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.120
Then click that create free account button to get started.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.380
And a lot of surprising things are Python first now.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:39.100
Like a lot of the ML stuff, which sounds computationally insanely heavy, is still Python first because

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.820
that's the way people want to talk to it.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.620
Who cares how its guts get over to the GPUs or whatever?

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.700
Yeah.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.380
I even saw that that little helicopter rover thing flying around Mars had a little bit of

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.460
Python involved in it.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:53.980
As far as I can tell, though, the system that they're using, I went to the GitHub repository

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.920
and poked around.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.460
People are like, Python's on Mars.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.060
Python's on Mars.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.800
I'm like, all right, well, let's see some details.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.620
As far as I can tell, Python was used to train the models on there.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.920
But I don't know that it's executed.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.840
There's a bunch of C++ code, and I suspect that's what's actually executing the stuff that

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.360
was trained up.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.700
But still pretty interesting that it was part of the story.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.960
Yeah.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.860
So the things that we talk about now, the GIL, async and await, type hints, web stuff, machine

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:21.880
learning, a lot of those things, maybe the GIL was really on the radar then.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.760
But a lot of the stuff like type hints and ML and whatnot are fairly new, I suspect.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.460
But what kind of things did you all talk about back in 94 and 95 and so on?

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.640
What was the important stuff that you had to work out then?

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:39.780
The things I remember from the first workshop were the Don Beaudry Metaclass hook.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.360
That was going to be my answer.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.740
Did I steal your thunder?

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.340
Sorry, Paul.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.020
Go ahead.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.040
No, hit it.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.000
Just don't make a mess of it.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.820
The funny thing was, I had just started getting into Python.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.300
So a lot of that kind of went over my head.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:58.720
I didn't really quite understand because I hadn't looked at the details of the implementation

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.140
of the object model and things like that at the time.

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.640
So I didn't really understand completely.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:09.540
I sort of understood metaprogramming a little bit, but I didn't quite get what Don and Guido

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.920
were talking about at the time.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.140
And I think Jim was involved, Jim Fulton as well, because he had...

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:19.020
I guess you guys were sort of thinking about Zope or whatever the precursor to Zope was,

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.360
and he was thinking about metaprogramming for that.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:21.960
Yeah.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.620
And it's weird.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.740
I think it was because of Fortran for whatever reason, interfacing Fortran and Python.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.560
I might have that wrong.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.760
But Don Beaudry...

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:29.880
Okay.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.280
So I'll wind it a little bit.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:31.560
Yeah.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.460
At that workshop, some of the things you were just saying, you can't...

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.300
Like Barry hinted at before, you can trace back to that workshop.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:38.700
Yeah.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.140
And some of the problems that needed to be solved there.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.240
The things I worked on were none of those, but I observed the useful stuff.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.080
And C extensions is everything that Barry was just talking about.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:54.800
It happens to be the tip of the iceberg on why Python has this sudden resurgence because,

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.460
you know, NumPy is all under the water in C.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.040
But back then, it was a mess.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:06.560
And I'm using that as a joke because Don Beaudry's extension ideas and software were called mess.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.660
Then Jim came back later with extension class that kind of formalized it.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:17.460
This is kind of gives genesis to when you briefly in Python 2 used to import from object or subclass,

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.960
I'm sorry, subclass from object to kind of get new style objects and stuff like that.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.880
That's a little remnant from, I think, a little bit from those days.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:32.160
That was more like a Python 2 thing where the new, like we had classic classes,

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.900
which were the old style class hierarchy.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.320
And then the new style classes.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.180
They lived together, you know, until Python 3, obviously.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:44.060
And you had to basically like inherit from object or set your meta class,

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.780
Dunder meta class attribute to do it.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.800
But the point is back in those days, interfacing to the big pile of C code

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.620
was such a big deal because we were the kid little toy scripting language.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.140
Right.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:34:00.680
And it's just so interesting to me that we went through a phase of outgrowing that and

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.100
you had these enormous systems that are mostly the waters being carried in Python.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:11.660
Now back to the chief value proposition is run that crap on the GPU and let the programmers

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.640
hang out in Python.

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:13.180
Right.

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:13.300
Right.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.680
Or some distributed grid computing or I don't want to know where.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:22.120
Just run it in a low level thing and I want to talk to it in this simple, clean API.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:22.740
Yeah.

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:23.240
Yeah.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:29.380
The irony, of course, I think is that in a lot of ways, C API is holding us back now.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.020
Sure.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:30.480
Yeah.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.360
To be honest with you, you know, there you want to change the memory management model

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.160
to be more GC or do a JIT.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.160
It's all easy except for those little pointers you passed off.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.580
Who knows what happens now, right?

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.320
Exactly.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:46.140
And the macros that are used to access tuples and so on and so forth.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.200
References.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.980
Those are all issues that are holding back.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:51.340
I think.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:56.380
I mean, sort of the way I think about it is there's nothing wrong with Python, the language

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:02.120
today that would prevent it from being the language of choice 30 years from now.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:07.500
But we're also dealing with the CPython interpreter is a 30 year old VM.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:12.620
And we've learned a thing or two about like how to write, you know, high performance VMs

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:18.680
in that time and getting the CPython implementation modernized to the point where we can do things

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:24.240
like potentially remove the GIL or adopt a GC or all those kinds of things that we want

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:24.580
to do.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.860
We have to now deal with 30 years of backwards compatibility.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:33.380
And that's a difficult problem to both a technical and a social problem to overcome.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.820
Hell, we're older than Java.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.620
Yeah.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.340
Yeah.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:41.240
Well, the other thing I think, Barry, that is makes that really significant is there's

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.000
the technical problem.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.740
I think, honestly, you could say we're going to just change the way it works and the important

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:47.800
stuff is going to get upgraded.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.980
The stuff that hasn't been touched for five years is just going to have to run on the

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.500
old thing and we could just move forward.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:52.960
Right.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.780
That would be fine.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:58.020
But I look at the difference between Python 2 and Python 3 and they seem really small to

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.260
me.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.620
Right.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.980
A little bit with strings and bytes, a little bit on classes, a few things.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.620
And that was it was existentially bad.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:09.600
That disjoint eight year period where the core developers are working on one thing and so many

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.220
other people are like, well, we're not going to touch that thing.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:11.900
We're just going to work on.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.280
Right.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.460
That was not a good deal.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:18.040
And the types of changes that you all are talking about, while maybe awesome, they seem

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.580
more significant than that, at least.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:24.320
And I suspect that people, at least for a while, are not willing to stomach another round of

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:24.500
that.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.140
What do you think?

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:32.020
I actually, I think if there ever is a Python 4, and I kind of doubt there will be a Python

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.460
4, I think it's not going to be at the Python level.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:39.380
To the extent that it's possible to, like, for example, remove the GIL and not require

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.800
Python level changes, which is still questionable.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.960
But it's all going to be at the C API, at the FFI sort of level.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:46.300
Right.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.320
It's going to be the things that Python integrates with that are going to change significantly.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:55.360
And I think that's, if I had my magic hat on with $10 million and, you know, I don't

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.780
know, a few tens of people to work on it, that's what I would do.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:36:59.180
Yeah.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.820
You could change the way it runs without changing the language whatsoever.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.420
Right.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.400
That would be totally fine.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:04.820
Yeah.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.580
And I don't think there's any magic.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:13.740
Like, if I talk to people who have worked on JavaScript VMs or other VMs, like, we know

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.600
what to do.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.700
There's no magical thing that we have to go figure out.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.740
This has all been done over and over again.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.980
Not that I could do it, but, you know, experts in building VMs could certainly do it.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.860
But it's managing that, I think, the social side.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.860
Like, what do you do about NumPy and all the C extensions that are out there?

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:31.740
That's a big ask.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:38.240
Eric Snow's effort with subinterpreters has kind of generated a lot of what about us from

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.140
NumPy.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:39.980
Oh, really?

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.320
Okay.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:40.840
Yeah.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:46.080
That's one of the attempts to not remove the gill, not a golectomy, but a, let's just

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.080
have mini gills and they can all coexist.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:48.840
Right.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.240
Right.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:49.760
Yeah.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.620
So just sort of on this historical, like, broad picture kind of journey we're on.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.180
You mentioned, like, you mentioned JavaScript, JITs, and VMs.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.480
Does this surprise you guys?

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.460
What has happened with JavaScript and its performance and stuff?

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:07.320
This thing that just ran in web browsers and now it's, they've gotten it to perform reasonably

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:07.700
well.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.740
To me, I just never saw that little thing going where it's ended up either.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:12.340
Yeah.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.420
I don't know.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:20.040
I, it doesn't really surprise me too much because I think, and Paul probably understands

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.840
this, you know, like languages are a lot like editors, right?

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.400
Like there's a religious part.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.340
And not, maybe not religious, but there's a, there's an emotional.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.140
Tribalism.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:28.700
Yeah.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.940
Tribalism with it.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.060
That's a great, or emotional connection to it.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.840
People love Python and they want to use it.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.180
And that gets them into that world.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:42.480
There's a lot of people whose first real experience with programming is sort of web technologies,

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.400
JavaScript, CSS, HTML, things like that.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:50.500
Especially in the bootcamp side of things these days, they've all seemed to have really, really

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.000
glommed onto that.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.040
Almost, I think, to a detriment for folks, but I think they've generated too many just front

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.400
end developers and not like broad skilled folks.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.680
But anyway, that's a side story.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.080
Yeah.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.600
So people, that's young people come in and they learn JavaScript and they enjoy it and

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.860
they can get, see the results immediately in their browser and do really cool things.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.980
And so I think it's a natural progression to want to be able to take that environment or

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.620
that experience and move it into other domains.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.940
And some, you know, JavaScript seems to be pretty malleable about that.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:27.220
So what about having one of the value propositions in the JavaScript world is it's JavaScript all the

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:27.740
way down.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.860
Could it be Python all the way down, right?

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.700
Like in the reverse direction, sort of.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:36.120
What do you guys think of the opportunity of WebAssembly and that to sort of like expand

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.740
the places that Python is happy?

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.220
Yeah.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:38.940
Paul, you want to?

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:39.380
Sure.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:44.900
And I know you did a podcast with Brett about this at the last PyCon.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.460
Yeah.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.780
And we did a live one.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.200
Yeah, exactly.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.580
We talked about the opportunity of Rust and WebAssembly for that.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:50.800
Yeah.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.140
I mean, they kind of go together a little.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:57.960
So in theory, that should be like Python's big chance to kind of, because Python, and this

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:03.240
is my little passion project working on the weekends about Python and the modern web and

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.440
Python's web story.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:11.920
And there's a lot of hope misplaced, in my opinion, on WASM as a silver bullet for Python.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.280
Heavy lift to kind of get there and the destination probably won't be what you think.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:22.880
But at the same time, it has opportunities that I don't think we quite understand and

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.400
appreciate from a platform that we could benefit, even on the server side, even on the mobile

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.880
side, to be not just producers of WASM, but consumers of WASM.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.220
Yeah.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:38.580
And there's a really cool Python library that will let you interop with any WASM language.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.060
Yes.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.840
I forgot what it's called, but it's not in the browser.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.100
It's just locally.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:42.660
Sure.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:43.000
Right.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.480
Yep.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.940
I'm going to get some WASM library that could be written in C, it could be written in Java,

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.260
whatever compiles down to that Rust.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.520
And then I'm going to use that in Python.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:57.140
I'm glad you're bringing up, and it's nice to tie it in a way to 1994, because I do care

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.820
a lot about Python and the web.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:02.760
And I worry, and I give talks about Python and the modern web.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.120
But it's interesting, a name we didn't mention.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:11.080
Kind of along your lines of JavaScript kind of eating the world, and maybe Michael Kennedy's

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.580
talk JavaScript to me coming to a theater near you sometime soon.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:23.300
And the one that came out of nowhere and ate the world in the first third of Python was PHP.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.220
Oh, yeah.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.720
And it should have run off.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.360
It should have hit its ceiling.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:35.380
And maybe a little bit like x86, maybe a little bit like JavaScript, maybe like a whole bunch

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.020
of other things that should have jumped the shark.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.280
There were plenty of sharks left to jump.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:45.240
And PHP got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and was being used for things that never

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.740
should have been used for because of the law of large numbers.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:52.860
And we just got to be worried about the law of large numbers with JavaScript as well.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.840
Yeah, for sure.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.600
John Sheehan says, transcript.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.640
Transcript.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.580
Yes.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:03.860
I have, for my little secret project, actually originated with generating some transcript from

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.280
Python side components.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:05.800
Yeah.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:11.020
A world that I would love to see is, like, the reason that JavaScript is so popular is it's

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:15.720
a non-avoidable requirement because it's the thing that all the browsers ship with that have

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.200
a runtime.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.620
With WebAssembly, it's totally simple to compile CPython over there.

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.200
There's things that don't work and there's maybe some edges you got to fix.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.540
Probably also for the JVM, probably also for the .NET runtime.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:31.920
Like, all these runtimes, they could be put into this form if the browsers would ship language

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.560
runtimes.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.500
If they would just go, our browser includes CPython, includes .NET, includes Java.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.600
Oh, it also includes JavaScript.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.180
Like, that would just change the game.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:44.040
But because every alternative is like, well, you need a 20 meg download.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.280
Well, that's a different, like, oh, well, that's not going to work, right?

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.180
The browser people could decide.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.360
There's only two of them left in the world.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.820
Maybe three if you count Safari.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:55.340
But, like, really, it's Chrome and then Firefox and a little Safari.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.380
It wouldn't be that hard to say, let's try to make some of these other languages available

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.460
as runtimes through WebAssembly.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.460
We already do WebAssembly.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.640
Just ship the binary and we'll be good to go.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.440
I would love to see that, but I'm not seeing any movement.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.540
Yeah, Barry has a story about JavaScript and Python.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.760
It's funny you mentioned that because I was going to say that, but I have since learned

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.460
that it's not actually true.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:16.940
Okay.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.260
So I'm going to skip that one.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:23.580
I was watching Brendan Eich's podcast and I was waiting for him to say it and he didn't.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.360
So...

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:29.220
Yeah, I have a colleague at LinkedIn who kind of hooked me, not directly up with Brendan,

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.820
but I was like, I was like...

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:31.140
Sure.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.100
Am I misremembering this story?

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.620
And yeah, it's kind of true.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.700
I was misremembering the story, so...

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:37.780
I like your story, though.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.380
It's a great story.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.040
It was a great story.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.700
It just wasn't true.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.100
Yeah.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.460
RJL out there says that'd be a great idea, Michael.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.900
What's stopping Google and Firefox from doing that?

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.720
Market forces.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.760
Well, I mean, to be fair, Microsoft has created this thing called Blazor that put the .NET

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.420
runtime in there.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.620
You just got to download it, right?

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.660
So I would not actually be surprised to see that ship with Edge at some point.

00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.560
But that idea across...

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.160
At least let...

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.700
I think JavaScript's fine, but let's let it compete on fair playing ground, right?

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.220
Like where the other languages could possibly even be an option.

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.140
So that would be fantastic for everyone, I think.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:11.700
And with WebAssembly, there's some interop, so who knows?

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:18.180
Looking forward, are you guys just astonished that that group of 20 people, 1994, worked

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:18.700
on this project?

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:23.900
And then you get articles like that tech one that I had about Python is eating the world

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.360
of software sort of thing.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.000
These are really big gaps.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.360
Did you guys ever imagine that you were onto a flame that would burn so bright?

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.520
Yeah, it's...

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.120
This is...

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:39.860
You and I talk about this kind of in the closing a little bit, and it's related to the why.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.980
How did Python get to where it got to?

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.020
What were the ingredients?

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.840
Could you trace it back to then?

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:51.280
And when we gave the talk the first time at the keynote panel at PyCon, Jim Fulton actually

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:57.320
brought this up, that people talk about the Python community being so kind and human, and

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.120
it's because Guido's kind and human.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:07.600
And so kind of put into the DNA back to 1994 was a person and a group of people around who

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.960
valued those kinds of things.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:15.240
At a time when other language communities had a bad reputation for those kinds of things.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.680
Barry, you want to expand on that?

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:22.420
I think it was Brett Cannon who coined the term, I came for the language and stayed for

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.000
the community.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.140
And that is so true.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:30.700
I mean, my closest friends, and in many ways, I mean, Guido actually lives not far from me

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:31.020
now.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.100
And I love just kind of getting together with him.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.660
A lot of times we don't even talk about Python.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:41.520
I mean, I have some of my really valued friends I've met through Python.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:48.380
So I think it does come down to Guido's leadership as far as personality and the kind of community

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.240
that he helped foster.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:55.740
It feels very inclusive and very positive and empowering to people.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:01.820
And I just really think that the community has done as much as the language to sort of build

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.160
Python to where it is today.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.720
Mike, I'll try and get back to your question a little bit with a little bit of an anecdote.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.920
All right.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:15.220
My role in the play was never technical, but I made coffee for the smart people.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:21.600
And I would do some of the organization stuff like the PSA and PSF with Greg Stein.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:26.220
And then I went away for a while and lived in Europe, didn't go to PyCon, came back.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.800
And damn, if Capital One didn't have a booth at PyCon.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:30.520
Yeah.

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:38.200
That blew me away back when we had Spam 1, Spam 2, Spam 3, this NIST workshop to think

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.540
that would be an outcome.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:45.680
And that these like really serious major players felt like, wow, we got to go do this.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.620
It's just astonishing to me.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:47.900
Yeah.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.000
For me as well.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.620
And I'm thinking back to the job fair that was in the 2020 PyCon, you know, walking around

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:54.780
there.

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:59.080
You just, so many people are like, you know, we're hiring, we're building these Python teams

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.120
to build our software.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:04.440
And some were, you know, the usual suspects, but many of them were not.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.960
Many of them were like you said, like Capital One type of places.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.180
You're like, you guys are doing this?

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.040
And that's...

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:09.460
Deloitte.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.220
I mean, really?

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:10.520
Wow.

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.000
Yeah.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:11.500
Yeah.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:11.660
Yeah.

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:12.260
Super interesting.

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.060
And I feel like the sentiment has shifted a little bit.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.940
It used to be like all these corporate entities are going to come in and like muck up our culture

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.000
and like break.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.200
They're going to be somewhat corrupting influences.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.900
And I feel like I don't really see that that's happened so much.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.040
So I'm happy for that.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:31.960
I feel like if anything, it's been a supporting type of thing to have this much opportunity in

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.540
this ecosystem.

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:38.280
And something I'll add to that is as much as we cherish Python to language, a perhaps

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.080
not equal achievement, but an important achievement is the PSF.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:47.940
And it's underappreciated because Barry and I were responsible for the failed predecessor,

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:51.080
Python software activity.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:54.520
These things require a number of ingredients and they require heroes.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:59.880
And in the middle third of Python, PSF and PyCon emerged.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.200
And these are important achievements.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:03.660
Yeah.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:07.340
Many people are probably aware, but I suspect many are not who are listening.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:11.760
How important PyCon is for funding the PSF in general, right?

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.980
That's the vast majority of their income is through that.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.700
And honestly, it was a big scare on what's going to happen when COVID hit.

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:23.520
They waited to the very last minute to cancel PyCon when the writing was clearly on the wall

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.860
that people cannot go there.

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:27.820
But it's like, well, we got to just figure out all the finances.

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.160
It was a big deal, right?

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.140
Yeah, huge.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:36.500
And let me echo, Paul, because the PSF and the folks, Eva and E and all the people who are

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.380
involved in the PSF, I can't even go through all the names.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:46.960
They do such great work and important work for the Python ecosystem and the Python community.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.180
And kudos to every single one of them because they're just fantastic people and it's a great

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:51.840
organization.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:58.240
And the PSF is not only supports what Python is today, but it really looks ahead.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:03.920
So like on the steering council, we work very closely with the PSF to try to understand,

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:10.620
you know, how can we utilize the PSF to help fund important work, for example, that Python,

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:13.500
the language or CPython, the implementation really needs.

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.560
So that's a great partnership.

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:17.980
I think that's kind of built up over the years.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:23.320
And there was just a big announcement that Google became the first visionary sponsor of

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:29.180
the PSF, which is like $390,000 a year or something like that, and hiring a core developer in residence.

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:34.020
So yeah, that's another sign of big support coming along.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:41.520
Maybe to close out this topic, if anybody out there has concerns about the PSF or like really deep-seated

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:47.020
problems with it, and you see me and Barry sometime, get us to tell you about the Python software activity.

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.900
You'll feel a lot better about the PSF.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.600
Yeah, that's good.

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:58.480
So on our little screen share here, I put up the new Python, the latest python.org compared to the 1997 one.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:04.940
It just occurred to me one thing that I went years without knowing is there's this little prompt looking icon right on the homepage.

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:08.240
If you click that, it's not working anymore.

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.020
Oh my goodness.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.620
Live demos, man.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:12.460
Yeah, I guess it doesn't work right now.

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.620
Maybe the Python Anywhere folks should have a look at this.

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.320
Probably will work by then.

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:17.960
I'll get on the Slack channel.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.100
Yeah, I'll let it know.

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:20.580
But I was really surprised.

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:24.800
You can go there and click and just open up the Python REPL, I think running in Python Anywhere, generally.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.140
So yeah, very interesting.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.640
It's a cool service they've done for the community for that.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.080
Yeah, it's very easy to just kind of get started.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:38.400
Because tracing that sort of very partial understanding of Python, what comes with that is also a partial understanding of Linux,

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:42.200
a partial understanding of servers, partial understanding of SSH, partial...

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:46.800
Like all these tools that you become so familiar with to weave this stuff together.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.400
In the beginning, these are major roadblocks.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.160
You're like, how am I going to do this thing?

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.100
Like there's these steps I need to learn.

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:56.880
And services like that that make it real easy and welcoming are pretty awesome.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.820
So let's round out our conversation with two quick thoughts.

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:02.940
One from both you guys.

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:09.580
You're probably seeing some really big opportunities that the Python ecosystem can take advantage of and grow around.

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:14.720
And there's probably also some dangers or some threats that we should maybe be aware of.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:20.420
You know, Russell Keith McGee gave a really interesting talk about Black Swan events and Python and so on and stuff like that.

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:21.300
So what do you think?

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:21.980
Opportunities?

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.260
Things we should be worried about or pay attention to?

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:25.800
There's one that popped in my head.

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:37.540
It may have been because you mentioned Russell's wonderful Black Swan talk, which was kind of followed in my mind by Lucas Longa's Pylondinium talk, which covered some of the same territory.

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:41.880
But what I'll talk about instead is the threat that wasn't.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:45.440
Or I'll talk about a couple of threats that weren't, if that's okay.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.540
Is that cheating, Michael?

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:47.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.300
No, that's not fine.

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.780
I think that's an awesome history lesson.

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:50.160
Tell us.

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.460
I remember going to see Guido when he was still with Google.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.100
God, Barry, how long ago would that have been?

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.440
10, 10 years?

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.900
At least, yeah.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:09.860
And even at that time, I was like, it kind of struck me going over to go see him in downtown San Francisco that he was in the process of handing over the reins.

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:16.340
How many successful projects, especially open source projects, don't outlive the founder?

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.500
Yeah, true.

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:21.520
And he's done wonderfully at that over the years.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:27.840
And in fact, his participation now appears to be because I want to, not because I have to.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.300
Yeah.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:29.260
Like, I'm retired.

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:29.620
I'll wait.

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:30.680
No, I'm just going to play around this.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.060
Indeed.

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.900
So that was a threat that wasn't.

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.340
And then another threat that wasn't.

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:40.780
Yeah, the whole formation of the steering council and what was going to happen when he retired and his, you guys got to figure it out.

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:41.500
This is not on me.

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:41.960
Indeed.

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:42.580
Indeed.

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:44.420
Not just figure out who it will be.

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.700
Figure out actually what system of governance.

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.120
You're the ones who got to live in what you come up with.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:49.300
How?

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.080
Yeah, right.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.480
Which is a wonderful act of humility on his part.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:56.400
He didn't view himself as essential to answering that question.

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.680
And I think he really trusted the community to come up with the right answers.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.620
It was a really interesting time.

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:04.860
And I do think that the community came together.

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:08.000
And, you know, we, there was lots of discussion about how to do it.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.720
And it really, really worked out.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:19.300
And I think that set Python up for this kind of longevity and continued success and continued relevance in technology.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:24.740
So then I'll do my other non-threat and then finally give you an answer on a threat.

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:29.300
Another non-threat that didn't happen was peak.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:33.600
And right at the time when the peak should have happened, maybe the first peak should have happened.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.660
I'll, and Barry, please.

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:40.940
In fact, I would love Michael to do a show on the actual story behind the story on this.

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:41.980
Jessica McKellar.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:47.800
In the middle third of Python, the PSF and PyCon as an engine of revenue.

00:53:48.040 --> 00:54:00.080
And then as an engine of gender diversity and bringing in a big, new, important, viable, lot of vitality audience into Python.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.960
Then on the way to data science doing the same thing.

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:08.400
So at a time when it should have perhaps been cresting, it did a double dip inflection point.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.340
Do you want to comment on that, Barry, before I go to an actual threat?

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:14.900
No, but I think that's one of the wonderful things about the Python community.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:18.760
And it's not just sort of, I mean, it's not just on a gender.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.500
Like it's also getting young people involved.

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:31.380
I think that's been a fantastic is to go to PyCon and see kid, like secondary school kids and how it's being taught in, in colleges.

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.880
And I've always.

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:38.100
Your son and my son went to the young coders on a long time ago.

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:43.260
I have to tell you, I'm super proud because my son is actually, he's using Python at work these days.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:45.200
So it's like, yes, it's awesome.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.000
That's fantastic.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.400
He's going to be out earning you pretty soon, Barry.

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.940
Yeah, hopefully.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.720
One could hope as a parent, right?

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:53.460
Exactly.

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:58.080
So my actual threat will go back to Russell and Lukash.

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:02.000
And man, I worry about Python and the web.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:08.960
I worry that what we've said is we seeded the user interface to JavaScript frameworks in the browser.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:13.640
And we're perfectly happy just shoving REST and JSON to them.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.420
And they might just decide like, why are we doing this other stuff?

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:17.680
We're almost all the way there.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.980
Like, let's just, come on, let's just go express node.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:20.400
We're done.

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:24.580
If you're a business decision maker and you're like, okay, I've got two teams.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:25.840
Why don't I got two teams?

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.620
And the one I value is the one that puts the pixels that are sexy.

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:30.080
Right, right.

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.080
They show me the shiny buttons and bits.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:32.540
Yeah.

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:38.320
And then as this modern web stuff kicks in and website performance really, really, really

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.800
becomes a thing and people pre-render on the server.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.460
So your React components have to be pre-rendered on the server, which means you have to run

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:48.660
React on the server and you can't run React in Python.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:51.720
So that's one I spend a lot of time thinking about.

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:52.360
Interesting.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:52.980
Right.

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:57.160
The pressure to make it not load with empty curly braces and then pop in all of a sudden.

00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:57.540
Yeah.

00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:57.980
Interesting.

00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:58.520
Yeah.

00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.240
That's a concern.

00:55:59.240 --> 00:55:59.420
Yeah.

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:02.560
I think the other thing that I'll add is Python on mobile.

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:03.040
Right.

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:08.740
Like everybody's got a phone in their pocket and Python doesn't have a super great story

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:09.120
there.

00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:15.780
Things like we have MicroPython, which has its place as smart homes, as IoT, and all those

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.020
things become more and more important in our lives.

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:22.380
I think Python needs to have a better story for mobile as well.

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.620
So those are two big challenges.

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:25.240
Yeah.

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:28.880
If you're going to ask me to make that, I guess I would have said mobile as well.

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:33.180
I think the saving grace there maybe is that mobile is so messed up also.

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.380
It's so tricky.

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.820
You've got these different languages, but they have these weird constraints.

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:40.680
And then you've got to go through the app store gatekeeper people.

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:41.200
And that's real.

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.660
It's less of a straight.

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.400
It's a more narrow ecosystem.

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:44.960
Exactly.

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.260
But it's also one of the most important ones.

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:47.740
Right.

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.720
I mean, it's where the really, really interesting stuff is these days.

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.480
A couple of comments from the live stream.

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:56.780
Robert Robinson says, I'd love to have learned Python in the mid-90s when I started learning

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:57.100
programming.

00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.460
My life would be totally different now.

00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.740
And John Sheehan says the item project looks really interesting.

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:02.260
Yeah.

00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:02.720
Indeed.

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.240
All right.

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:06.580
Well, those are the downer sides of things.

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.500
Paul, one thing I would like to say about the web.

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:13.420
I do feel like there's a really interesting resurgence in the Python web frameworks.

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:17.760
Now that the Python 3 that have sort of crossed over and they're like, let's just take advantage

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.340
of all the modern Python goodies.

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:25.000
Things like FastAPI, Starlit, as well as some other ones like Django Ninja and whatnot are coming

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.900
along to do interesting things that make it feel really refreshing to do Python web stuff.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:33.820
And I still think there's interesting things that are happening there that are compelling.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:37.940
Like I was talking to somebody, I can't remember the context, but they had a Django

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:41.880
system and some of the Django views were regular Python, but they actually did some of them

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.900
in Cython because they had like really high performance requirements.

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:49.500
And like the views were computed in Cython, which is, I mean, these are really interesting

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.040
use cases that are out there.

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:51.420
All right.

00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:52.100
Really quick.

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.160
We're running low on time.

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:53.940
Opportunities.

00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.280
What do you guys see as the big opportunity?

00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.660
That's a great question because I think it also comes into sort of predicting where technology

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:02.340
is going in the next few years.

00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:05.260
And I don't really know that I can do that.

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:09.020
I mean, I've been surprised over and over and over again in my career.

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:15.760
So again, I really think it comes down to the appeal of Python, the language.

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:21.520
And really, one of the things I think Guido did back in the Jython days when Jpython was

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:28.940
the thing and that became Jython, was he recognized the need to sort of separate the language evolution

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.560
from the implementation.

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:35.500
Now, the reality is, you know, we've had multiple implementations of Python over the

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:35.800
years.

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.760
And, you know, essentially, you see Python is still the most popular version, but it doesn't

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.900
have to be that way.

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:57.040
And I think as big companies have more and more Python in their ecosystem of technology, I think it becomes more imperative for them to kind of step up and help fund those kind of...

00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.140
Like, I really think if we could just hit some of those big people, big companies that we talked

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:05.900
about, get a million dollars from each of them, and you could do some really incredible stuff with

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:06.260
Python.

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:09.940
And they would benefit way more than that million dollars.

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:10.820
Totally.

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:11.540
Right?

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:12.120
Yeah.

00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.500
Especially in Wall Street.

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:16.120
If you could make their trades one millisecond quicker.

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:16.640
Yep.

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:16.900
Boom.

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.760
Like, that's just like printing money right there.

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.140
Or even more important, what can't they do?

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.400
Hire people fast enough.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.380
So make your current people more productive.

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.180
Exactly.

00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:27.020
And there's no reason why it can't be done.

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:34.700
Like I said, we have the organization because the PSF is solid and knows how to do this, knows how to manage these projects, right?

00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:38.800
Is a non-for-profit, so there's no favoritism going on there.

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:42.300
We have the technologists who can make this happen.

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.680
The track record to show that they can do it?

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.320
Exactly.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.880
So I think, to me, that is the biggest opportunity.

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:55.140
And if I saw that come together, and those are some of the things that PSF and the steering council are trying to put together.

00:59:55.140 --> 01:00:01.160
So that is so exciting because it could be an amazing 25 years, but more Python.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.260
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.280
So I'll throw one out there for you all.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.740
For a while, there was this language called Java.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:07.720
You guys talked about it.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:13.140
And that seemed to be the language of the first year computer science program.

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.400
When I did computer science, I took a couple of classes.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:22.920
My degree is in math, but I took a couple of computer science classes, and that was Scheme and Lisp, which I don't feel was the best option necessarily, but that's what I did.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.660
But for a long time, it was Java.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:34.620
I think the big opportunity is so many people are learning Python from the very beginning that now it's in this place of, well, why not Python instead of why Python, right?

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:37.820
If you're already working, you're already comfortable, you've already done projects in it.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:38.900
You've had success.

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.320
Like, well, yeah, I could use other languages, but why not?

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:49.080
One thing that I think is really interesting about this Stack Overflow trends I have up on our screen shares, do you notice how there's two humps every year for Java?

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.100
And a lot of the other ones, they don't have those humps, but Java has two humps a year.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.280
Those are fall semester and spring semester.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.080
How interesting.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:57.920
Interesting.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.520
Yeah.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.900
Those humps are going away at the end a little bit.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.680
So they're kind of coming into the Python world.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.300
So I think it's really interesting.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.800
I think that's the opportunity is for the communities.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.620
There's many fresh and excited young people coming in.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:18.960
Much like your survey showed that professional coding experience, the most common option was less than a year for Python developers, right?

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.520
There's a lot of fresh, exciting people coming in.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.680
And I think that's all good.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:32.160
I'll give an opportunity that's similar to that, which is also non-technical, which is people oriented, which is in the most recent Python bytes.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.320
Brian used a clever expression about the long tails getting fatter or something like that.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.760
I can't remember what the context was about.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.180
The PSF diversity and inclusion working group.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:52.060
Expanding the footprint of Python in next level markets and populations and groupings of people with passions and interests.

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:52.600
Yeah.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.640
These are all really super important things because Paul and I have been involved in Python for a long time, right?

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.180
Like as Guido retired, you know, someday, hopefully, you know, right?

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.160
And I think it's really important.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:22.340
Like I feel the responsibility more and more to help mentor younger people who are coming into technology in general, but also into the Python community and really nurture that engagement because that's the energy that's going to propel Python forward.

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.180
So...

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.840
Hey, Michael, I got to give you a pat on the back.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:30.380
You've become a place to give a voice to the next generation of stars.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.720
So kudos to you for that.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.460
Oh, thanks, Paul.

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:33.480
Yeah, thank you so much.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.060
That's really nice.

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:34.920
Yeah, absolutely.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:47.840
I think one of the things that I've tried to do is to try to find people that have really interesting stories of like how Python has like massively empowered them, even if they haven't built the most popular open source project or they don't work at the biggest company.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:54.760
Sometimes that story of nothing to something really powerful, even though not too many people know about it, is really quite amazing.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:55.420
I try to tell that.

01:02:55.420 --> 01:03:00.960
Speaking of the education side, RJL says, at our science center, we teach Python to STEM students grades five to eight.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.880
It's been very successful.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:02.920
You're the hero.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.540
Yeah, man.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.000
Awesome.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:04.720
Wow.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.440
All right, guys, for the sake of time, I'm going to cut our final two questions down to one question each.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.860
Barry, I'm going to give it to you first because you're a bit of an unknown.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.180
Paul, I'll see if I can guess his answer.

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.700
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:17.460
Emacs.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.460
Emacs, right on.

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:19.820
Sorry, Paul.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.660
I expect nothing less, Barry.

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:24.120
All right, Paul.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:24.860
Paul, what are you feeling?

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:25.880
What are you doing these days?

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.880
I have a PyCharm open right now.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.660
Awesome.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.220
Fantastic.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:31.780
Yeah.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:35.400
I don't have it open now, but I'm loving that you guys built it for the M1.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.820
It's so nice to work with these days.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:37.520
Yeah, very good.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.480
It's a great tool.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.160
I think it's really good for helping people get into it, but also like it's scales as well.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.300
It's great experience-wise.

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:51.260
Well, to speak for other products as well, we're seeing the rise of smart editors and smart tool

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.280
chains for Python.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.740
I think that's fantastic for everybody and all of us.

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:56.240
Yeah.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.240
It's really cool.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:02.580
I mean, I acknowledge my minority status as an Emacs user, even in like the text space.

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:08.900
Like there's many more Vim users, but I can see my colleagues at work, what they use.

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:14.820
And it's really fantastic to see like all the amazing support that these modern editors

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.340
have for Python.

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:17.000
Yeah, I agree.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.220
And they take some of these ideas like type hints and stuff and like amplify their value.

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:21.580
Yeah.

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:28.040
And integration with static checkers and linters and mypy type checkers and all that kind of

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.460
stuff is like, those are really important tools for the modern Python developer.

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.900
And it's great to see all that stuff really well integrated.

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:35.460
Yeah.

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.140
Fantastic.

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:37.960
Well, thank you both for being on the show.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:43.000
You want to give a final thought, a final comment to the people out there thinking on this historical

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.860
sort of arc that we've been covering?

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.020
What do you want to say?

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.000
You want to go first, Barry?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:47.580
Sure.

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.840
I'll say this.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:55.140
Python is where it is today because of the people who have gotten involved over the years,

01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:55.520
right?

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:01.480
And I talked to some folks who are like, I don't know C, so I can't be involved in Python

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:01.840
development.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.920
No, that's not true.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.860
In fact, you don't even need to be a programmer necessarily to be involved in Python development.

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.460
Everybody is welcome and everybody's valued.

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:13.940
So if you like Python, get involved.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:15.420
That might be with the PSF.

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:17.120
It might be with the language design.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.440
Whatever it is, education.

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:23.480
Maybe even your favorite open source project that's not strictly under CPython.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.340
Exactly.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:24.420
Exactly.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:24.940
Exactly.

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:28.140
All these things are available to anybody.

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:33.640
There's no cost other than an internet connection and a browser or an editor or something like

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:33.940
that.

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.860
Everybody can get involved.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:42.020
And I really encourage, I encourage everyone to sort of change the mindset of these are the

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:42.480
barriers.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:49.580
So therefore, I can't get involved to these are the opportunities that I can shine and grow

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.280
and learn.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.740
And so I think it's the people.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.020
It always comes down to the folks.

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:54.380
Yeah.

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:54.860
Yeah.

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:55.840
That's a great sentiment.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.280
Paul?

01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:02.960
Maybe in a similar vein, thinking about 1994 and driving back from girls across practice to come

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.080
and be on the show.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:09.840
I was thinking about most people in their lives, they'll have something they're really passionate

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:15.360
about, but then a decade passes and their life changes and they have kids or something.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.160
And then they got to buy like a red convertible.

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:18.800
Yeah.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.580
So they change over to something else and then their kids move out of the house and their passion

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.020
changes to something else.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:31.100
So during these decades of their lives, they really latch onto something, believe deeply in

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:31.300
it.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.660
It's part of their identity.

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:33.940
But then they move on.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:39.700
And I think about for Barry and me, and I get to be on the show with the Fluffle and it's

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:40.300
wonderful.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.740
The friendly language uncle for life.

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.140
That's a good story too.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:51.860
And I've gone through those three decades and still, if I was to self-assess who I am, what's

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:54.520
my identity, who's my tribe, it's Python and the web.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.540
And it's still the thing I believe in.

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.040
It's how lucky am I?

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:02.820
I mean, that's just graceful way to have the years go by.

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:03.340
Yeah.

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.480
Hear, hear, Paul.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.240
It's been an amazing journey.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.100
That's not over yet, hopefully.

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:11.000
And Python gave me a life.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:11.920
It really did.

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:18.440
So I'm so grateful to the language, the community, to Guido, to everybody, Paul, everybody that

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:18.880
I meet.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.460
Python's really an amazing, been an amazing experience, a great ride.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:22.960
Yeah.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:26.200
One of those types of things you can wake up and go, I get to do this.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.400
Like, I don't have to do this.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:27.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.660
Can you believe I get to do this?

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:30.480
They're going to pay me for this.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.400
I would have done this for free.

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:32.260
That kind of stuff.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.000
Yeah, it's fantastic.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:33.460
All right.

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:34.540
Well, let's leave it there.

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.820
Thank you both for being on the show.

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.000
It's been really great to chat.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.460
Michael, thank you so much.

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.620
Thank you for having us.

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:40.480
Yeah, it's been great.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.580

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.460
Thanks so much for listening.

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:07.620
I really appreciate it.

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.520
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.480
I hope you enjoyed that interview with Barry and Paul.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.840
Barry, take us out of here.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:40.100
Beautiful is better than ugly.

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.380
Explicit is better than implicit.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.540
Simple is better than complex.

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:52.480
Complex is better than complicated.

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:55.660
Flat is better than nested.

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:58.860
Sparse is better than dense.

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:05.000
Readability counts.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:14.040
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.400
Although practicality counts.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.660
Although practicality beats purity.

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:25.780
Errors should never pass silently.

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:28.700
Less explicitly silenced.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.740
In the face of ambiguity.

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:34.640
Refuse the temptation to guess.

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:36.860
There should be one.

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:37.860
There should be one.

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:41.060
Preferably only one.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:44.300
Obvious way to do it.

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:50.360
Although that way may not be obvious at first.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.320
Unless you're Dutch.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.360
Now is better than ever.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:02.640
Now is better than ever.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:02.680
Now is better than ever.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:02.680
Now is better than ever.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:02.680
Now is better than ever.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:11.140
Although never is often better than lying now.

01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:16.760
If the implementation is hard to explain.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.080
It's a bad idea.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:29.500
If the implementation is easy to explain.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:37.180
It may be a good idea.

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:42.460
Namespaces are one.

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.220
All good.

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.460
Great idea.

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:49.400
Let's do more of those.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.480
Let's do more of those.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.540
you

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.040
you

01:11:54.040 --> 01:12:24.020
Thank you.
