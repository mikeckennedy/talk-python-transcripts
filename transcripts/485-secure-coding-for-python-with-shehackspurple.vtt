00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.900
What do developers need to know about AppSec and building secure software?

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.340
We have Tanya Janka, aka SheHacksPurple, on the show to tell us all about it.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.580
We talk about what developers should expect from threat modeling sessions,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.100
as well as concrete tips for securing your apps and services.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.600

Tanya, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.680
I mean, it's awesome to have you here.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.600
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited to be here.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.920
Thank you for having me, Michael.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.800
Yeah, you're very welcome.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.860
And I'm super excited.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.180
You know, in a good and bad way, excited to have you here because I'm very excited to talk to you.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.840
But some of the stuff that we're going to talk about might be a little unnerving for people out there listening.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.860
They may pause the show and then run off to make some changes to what they're doing and then come back.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.880
And then that part might be a little exciting in a different way.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.400
Yes, it will.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.920
Have you ever had that experience where you're giving a presentation or something and somebody goes gasp in the audience and maybe runs away or something?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.160
I was doing a capture the flag contest once and I was showing people how to do an SQL injection.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.920
And then we just like logged in without a password.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.860
And this woman was like, oh my gosh.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.340
And she literally just she stood up.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.320
She's like, I have to go.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.760
And she told me the next day she fixed three of them at work.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.200
And she just stayed all night.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.940
Oh, amazing.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.140
You made a huge impression.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.600
It was pretty cool.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.460
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.280
I've never had that around security, but I was doing an in-person class once for database things, which we're going to touch on databases for sure.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.980
And this had to do with transactions.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.020
And I said, if you do things this way, it doesn't actually use a transaction unless, oh, yes, it does.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.660
And I showed that it did.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.420
And somebody said, I'll be back later.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.280
And they just took off.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.980
Oh my gosh, this is not good.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.800
We have to fix this now.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.680
So, yeah, hopefully no one actually has to do that here.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.460
But I'm sure there's a ton for people to learn.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.740
Speaking of learning, let's start with a little bit about you.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.160
You have a domain, shehackspurple.ca.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.820
That tells us several things about you, I believe.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.420
Purple is interesting.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.140
Hacks is interesting.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.900
And Canada.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.000
Tell us about yourself.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.380
So I was a software developer for a really long time.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.260
And then I switched to security.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.440
And when I was a software developer, I used to also play music in bars and music festivals as sort of my hobby.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.280
But I released albums and did all of that.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.700
So that's why I'm quite the public speaker, because I've been on stage my whole life.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.700
And so I switched to security.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.820
And I became a pen tester, which is Red Team.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.920
And that's where you attack things.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.400
And it's a fence of security.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.940
And I don't mean we swear at people.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.280
But then...

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.400
It's the other way around, I believe.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.260
This is the direction the swearing probably goes.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.500
Right?

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.120
But then as I was doing pen testing, I kept sitting with the devs.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.780
And I would pair a program with them.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.000
And I would help them fix things.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.860
And I'm like, well, if we threat model this...

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.560
And I kept doing AppSec, essentially.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.240
And people are like, you keep doing blue team.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.380
You keep doing defenses.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.280
It's like you can't make up your mind.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.160
And eventually one of them is like, you're a purple team.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.800
And so I was at a conference in Europe.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:47.540
And on stage during the conference, this woman, she kept playing with her phone on a panel, ignoring the audience.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.560
And I was super shocked.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.180
And finally, she's like, I'm really sorry.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.100
But her company had created WannaCry by accident.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.400
Yeah.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.920
And it had just broken out.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.080
And she's like, so there's this virus.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.220
And it just hit the NHS and took down the hospitals and this and that.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.560
And oh, my gosh.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.700
And so everyone ran out of the room freaking out.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.340
And they all went to check Twitter.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.960
Because that's where everyone was talking.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.600
And so people are like, you have to make a Twitter account.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.960
And so I was like, oh, what will I call myself?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.820
And I was like, she acts computers.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.560
And then it was too long.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.700
Because that was my email address.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.560
She acts computers at gmail.com.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.580
That used to be my email.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.400
But then basically, that was too long.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.360
So I was like, I don't know.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.700
And someone's like, well, you know, you have that purple team thing going.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.120
So I was like, well, it's not like anyone will ever follow me.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.720
So I changed it into She Hacks Purple.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.260
And then it turns out that I really, so then I put some purple in my hair to tease my friend

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.720
Kevin.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.060
And it went all from there.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.000
Like, yeah.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.040
I own a lot of purple now.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.380
That's amazing.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.280
Yeah.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.520
It's now part of the vibe, right?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.100
That's awesome.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.000
That's a really cool story.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.140
So you said you've been a programmer for a while and then got into app security and pen

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.480
testing.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.720
How did you get into all that?

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.520
It was totally an accident.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.120
So like I said, I was in a band.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.740
And so we had this pen tester in our office and he was in a band.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.020
And so we obviously became friends.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.540
And one day I came to his desk and I was like, hey, my band wrote this song called Mandatory

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.200
Dance Party.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.900
And we want to make this mobile app where if you're near someone else that has the app,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.080
it goes beep, beep, beep.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.420
Mandatory Dance Party.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.500
And then you both have to dance or else.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.120
And then whoever jiggles their phone the most wins.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.960
I'm like, did you want to make this app with me?

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.000
He's like, there's nothing I want to do more.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.680
And so our friendship began.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.620
And then for a year and a half, he just nagged me to become a pen tester.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.840
He's like, you'd be so good.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.080
You'd be really good at it.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.440
You've been doing you've been a dev for like 17 years.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.760
It's time for something new.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.620
And I was like, no, I am the king of software.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.980
This is the best.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.700
I make something out of nothing all day.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.500
It'll never be cooler than this.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.640
But then it turned out it was pretty cool.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.080
And you still get to write code sometimes.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.620
And then eventually I figured out I was not meant to be a pen tester.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.880
I was meant to do app sec.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.900
So I still get to hang out with devs all day.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.100
I'm not alone freezing cold in a data center at night.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:16.000
And I get to it's like more like a social butterfly type of job where a pen tester is more like

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.540
the lone wolf type of job.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.900
Yeah.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.420
Yeah.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.520
You're working on the disassembly, looking for, you know, fuzzing something, looking for a crash.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.080
Yeah.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.280
So you still get to break stuff in app sec sometimes, but like, that's not all you do.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.620
You do a lot of conversations, a lot of brainstorming, and that's better for my extroverted personality.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.360
Yeah.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:37.860
That's awesome.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.960
You have a newsletter.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.820
People can visit your website and sign up and I'll put links to all those sorts of things

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.400
in the show notes for you.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.160
So yeah, a couple of things I wanted to talk about.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:55.340
First of all, I've seen you given presentations about threat modeling and tell us what is threat

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.640
modeling and what are some of the takeaways?

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:05.000
Obviously our audience here is largely Python developers, data scientists, and a ginormous assorted

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.860
other that sort of orbits around those spaces.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.600
So they'd probably be pretty interested on the developer data scientist side of threat modeling.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.540
What is it and what's it like for devs?

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:22.060
So threat modeling is sort of like evil brainstorming.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:28.060
So you get a security person like me in the room, you get a dev or one of the technical leads

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.320
for your system, and then you get the product owner.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.380
So the person that understands the business of this app and like why it exists in the world.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.780
And at least those three people.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.360
If more people come, it's better, but that's fine.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.160
And then you talk about what could go wrong and what are you going to do about it?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.800
I have this friend named Adam Shostak who's written a bunch of books about it.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.560
And so I used to ask a ton of questions and then I met him.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.300
And now I ask four things.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.860
What are we doing?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.620
And so then I usually draw it out on a whiteboard.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.240
So like, oh, there's an API and it talks to this and then this happens and then people steal bikes.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.700
Okay.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.040
And then it's like-

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.520
Do we have a database?

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.360
Is it in the cloud?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.560
Is it in a data center that we own?

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.240
Whatever, yeah.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:10.740
Yeah.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.480
And then I ask questions along the way and then I'm like, so what could go wrong here?

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.900
And then it's like, you know, these two things are talking.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.240
Do we authenticate first or do we just talk to any old API?

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.100
Right?

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.860
And we go through and we come up with some things that could go wrong and we make a list.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.220
And then I'm like, okay, so what are we going to do about these things?

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.440
And you talk about basically, is this a serious risk?

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.440
Is it scary?

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.680
Or is it like, you know what, if that happens, it's not really a big deal and the likelihood is really, really rare.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.440
So maybe we'll accept that risk.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:50.980
But a lot of them, it's like, you know, if we added a certificate here or we included authentication there, like we can make some small changes.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.380
And if you're during the design phase of the system development lifecycle, it costs you nothing, right?

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:00.340
Or usually it costs you nothing or very little.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:05.760
And so then you basically improve your design and then you write it all out.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.320
And then hopefully someone approves these changes.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.300
And then at the end, a thing that Adam asks is, did we do a good job?

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.700
And that is the magical question.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:25.240
Because the very first time I did one of these in the government, I did not realize that that's what I was doing to my director.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.040
I was like, well, what about this?

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.760
And what about that?

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.580
And this could go wrong.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.580
And because I was trying to kill the project because I thought it was a terrible part.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.980
And we did end up canceling it.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:39.940
But I brought up like all these huge existential risks to this ridiculous project they were thinking of doing.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.360
And he just kept saying, it'll be fine.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.500
And I'll manage that risk.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.340
And I was like, you realize manage that risk means nothing, right?

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.180
You're going to do nothing.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.060
So I brought up eight really big risks.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.020
And you want to do nothing about any of them.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.040
I'm like, are we doing it?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.760
Like, do you think we've done a good job here?

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.800
Like, you feel proud today?

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.740
Because I don't.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.320
And then we started again.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.400
And then eventually over the months, we canceled the project because it was quite silly.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.400
Just to be clear, I usually love it when software development projects go forward.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.140
This was a very special situation where it was not in the taxpayer's best interest.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.060
Yes.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.760
Anyway, I'm like, there's more there.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.940
But I'm like, NDAs.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.140
Yeah, of course.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:26.300
But usually we come up with like a couple of changes that grossly reduce the risk of the system.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.620
And it's quite fun.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.820
Like, once you start.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:38.900
So the first time I went to a threat model, I came with my dev background of, I will fix any problem you bring to me.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.840
I just need to do code.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.360
And I can fix whatever you need.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.280
But it's different when it's like, I'm going to try to break things.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.300
You have to learn kind of this new skill set of like, how can I make it do stuff it should not do?

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.720
And it took me a while.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.880
And now I'm brutal.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.280
Like, I go to the movies.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.780
I'm like, we could have gotten free.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.980
It's even outside of technology now, huh?

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.140
Oh, yeah.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.620
Oh, it's everywhere now.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:09.700
My significant other who does not work in tech will be like, I'm just trying to threat model this for the kids.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.220
If we go to the pool, they'll have wet bathing suits.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.480
Yeah.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:15.820
Yeah.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.500
Very nice.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.420
You know, I think there's two different ways to look at this, right?

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:27.200
Obviously, from a developer perspective, you've got to look at, well, what packages or libraries am I using?

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.280
And how are we validating input and all those kinds of things?

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.740
And I feel like that's one level, but maybe the threat modeling is a little bit broader.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.660
Like, are we storing stuff unencrypted anywhere?

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.900
Yeah.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.600
Who could get that?

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.000
And it's the thing that makes me nervous.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.480
I said I would be somewhat nervous about this at the beginning.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.500
The stuff that makes me nervous about all of these things is the asymmetry of it.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:57.080
As a developer or data scientist or somebody in charge of this information and the systems, you have to be right all the time, right?

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.760
And if you're ever not right, little Bobby Tables is on you like nothing.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.420
It's like a goalie.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.040
It's like a goalie, right?

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.780
Like, you let into goals and everyone's like, you're the worst.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.680
And it's like, I defended against hundreds of shots.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.040
Do I get nothing?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.680
Exactly.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.300
Well, developers shouldn't be on their own in this, though.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.300
That's the whole thing.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:25.620
So, like, the job of the AppSec person, in my opinion, is to support the developers in making more secure apps, right?

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:36.360
So, booking a threat modeling time with them or, you know, providing a static analysis tool or a secret scanner or whatever to scan their code so that they can make better code.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:48.360
So, they have help giving them training, giving them, like, a list of super clear requirements at the beginning of the project rather than at the end telling them it's wrong.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.600
That is a huge one.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:57.620
Like, if someone's going to build an API, I would prefer the API be behind an API gateway if it's publicly accessible.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:05.120
And I want to do things like turn on authentication and authorization and rate limiting and all sorts of fancy, nice, awesome stuff that they offer.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:12.240
And so, I tell them at the very beginning of the project, I don't wait until the end and I'm like, well, this design's all wrong.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.400
Like, if, you know what I mean?

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:14.840
Yeah.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.920
But that's what we did back in the day.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:24.120
Like, when I had my first vulnerability assessment done, I, you know, I'm supposed to go to prod in two days.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.880
And they ran the world's crappiest dynamic scanner on my computer, on my app.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.360
And they're like, you have cross-site scripting.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.660
And this was so long ago.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.920
I searched for cross-site scripting on the internet and there was only three web pages.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.760
So, I'm old, everyone.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.700
And one was this thing called OWASP.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.920
And I was like, what the heck is that?

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.340
And it took me quite a while to figure out how to fix it, right?

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:56.260
Like, we've come a long way, but yeah, the developer shouldn't be alone in this anymore.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.860
They should have help.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.540
I'm not saying that every company does have that.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.700
I'm saying every company should.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.540
If you have a bunch of devs, you should have eventually a security person that supports them.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:06.960
Right.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.440
Maybe sits with them for a few hours a week or a month or something.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.660
And sort of, as you said, like a butterfly sort of moves around the team, hanging out with other people.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.880
Like, oh, you work on the API.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.080
Okay, let me hang out with you a bit this morning.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.980
Ideally, that would be great.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:26.760
Also, I mean, if you have a big enough company doing something like a security champions program.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:33.600
So, like each dev team, there's one representative and you just give them way more training and way more time.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.700
And you check in with them regularly.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:41.320
Like, if I'm working with only like 50 or 60 devs, like you can get to know a lot of them.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.780
But I remember working at this one place and there were 2000 devs and me.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:52.200
And I was like, okay, so how do I do this?

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:57.620
And just very quickly, there was just like that one person per team that I would talk to all the time.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:06.120
And I remember, ironically, I went to Montreal on this vacation trip and my car got stuck in the mud because there'd been this big rainstorm.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.620
And I was like tweeting about it and how I was so sad.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.740
And one of my devs came to me and dragged me out of the mud.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.240
And I was like, he is a champion.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:15.920
I know.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.840
Oh, that's amazing.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.800
And there's benefits to large teams aren't in there.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.140
I know.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.740
I like, it never occurred to me that like I would get an answer.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.320
He's like, hey, I live in Montreal.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.160
Do you need help?

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.400
And I was like, I do.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.020
And he's like, you help me all the time.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.840
I'll be right there.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.040
I was just like, oh, that's very cool.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.560
Yeah.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:43.120
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Posit, the makers of Shiny, formerly RStudio, and especially Shiny for Python.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.100
Let me ask you a question.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.800
Are you building awesome things?

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.840
Of course you are.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.420
You're a developer or a data scientist.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.320
That's what we do.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.360
And you should check out Posit Connect.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:59.340
Posit Connect is a way for you to publish, share, and deploy all the data products that you're building using Python.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.520
People ask me the same question all the time.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.680
Michael, I have some cool data science project or notebook that I built.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.960
How do I share it with my users, stakeholders, teammates?

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.780
Do I need to learn FastAPI or Flask or maybe Vue or React.js?

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.000
Hold on now.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.920
Those are cool technologies, and I'm sure you'd benefit from them.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.800
But maybe stay focused on the data project.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.280
Let Posit Connect handle that side of things.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:27.000
With Posit Connect, you can rapidly and securely deploy the things you build in Python.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:33.460

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.740
That's talkpython.fm/P-O-S-I-T.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.620
The link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.880
Thank you to the team at Posit for supporting Talk Python.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:08.300
So you managed it almost, I don't want to endorse Scrum necessarily, but like a Scrum of Scrum equivalent.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:16.080
So sort of you found somebody or different people from who could sort of represent different segments or apps and stuff and got together with those groups.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:16.640
Yeah.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.460
Yeah.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:24.640
So I didn't know what it was called when I started doing AppSec because I didn't have any training, right?

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.480
I was just like, all of our apps are a total mess.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.700
I just switched to the security team.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.580
I need to fix this.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:42.620
And so I was trying to talk to all of them, but very quickly, there was like a person that sort of self-identified as the person who was totally willing to tolerate Tanya and all of her security nerdiness.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:47.260
And I would hold these little lunch and learns where I was like, oh my gosh, my first one.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:53.580
I remember I, because I'd been on the dev team and then I switched to the security team and I was like, I'm going to break into a bank at lunch.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.720
Who wants to watch?

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.160
I brought donuts.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.920
And everyone's like, you're not going to.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.200
And I'm like, it's a, it's a pretend bank, but I'm going to do it.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.060
And they're like, but donuts, right?

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.740
I'm like, yeah.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.260
You just got to choose the right motivation.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:14.900
I feel like pizza, any sort of carb goes really like it goes over well.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.760
But yeah, I just slowly formed more and more relationships.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.480
And then that is how I got a lot of security done because I'm not their boss.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.420
I can't make them prioritize security.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.140
I need to persuade them that it's important.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:39.720
And one of those people from my very first program, he became an application security engineer and he just started his first security champions program this year.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.360
And I spoke for them two months ago and it was amazing.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:42.840
Exciting.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.860
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:51.540
Honestly, I think coming from the software dev side probably gets you a lot of credibility with the software teams.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:58.540
Yeah, because I can just like read code and stuff and the rest of the security team usually can't.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.020
And also, so I've gotten in trouble for that, though.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:07.820
I've gotten in trouble with the security team at a couple of places I've worked where they're like, you're always on their side.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.340
And I was like, yeah, but they're right and we're wrong this time.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.460
Because sometimes the security team's being so completely unflexible.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.500
And I'm like, listen, this is like a minute risk if you really think about it.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.000
Where like if you look at the context of this and this, it doesn't generate legitimate business risks.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.580
So, no, I'm not going to upgrade off of this vulnerable library because it's not actually exploitable.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.000
And there's this and this and this precaution.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.860
And like we're actually fine.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.580
And it's going to cost like months and months of time.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.900
And so I'd rather use my social currency on something that really matters.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.860
And I've just had people get really pissed at me on the security team.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.660
Like this plus between username and query.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:53.640
So, yeah, it's just not good.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.400
It's just not good.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:03.760
There is, you know, you see all the time, whether it's NPM or pip or whatever package management tool you're using,

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.140
you might see, oh, or GitHub.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.360
This library you're using has this vulnerability.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.040
And it sounds scary.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:18.340
But if the vulnerability is in a portion of it that you literally never use and you never expose the internet, you know, it might be bigger fish to fry.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:18.600
Who knows?

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.060
Maybe not.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.420
But a lot of it's hard to decide.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.580
Insecurity, we call...

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.360
As you're saying where to spend your time.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.600
Yeah, so we call that reachability in the InfoSec field.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:34.100
And so my advice, and not everyone agrees, is basically if something...

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.900
So let's say you have the math library.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:40.240
And the math library has like a thousand different math functions because we love math.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.600
And one of them has a great big bug in it.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.300
But we're not calling that one.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:44.700
Right.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.860
And it's probably like a denial of service.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.040
If you give it this weird number, it'll overflow and then like loop forever.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.980
And we're never calling it.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.560
Yeah, maybe it's something like really bad.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.180
It's like remote code execution.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.020
Like this sucks.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:58.480
Okay.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.840
But if it's not reachable from within your code, it's probably not actually a risk.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.680
So let's say it's like the worst one.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.880
It's remote code execution.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.840
I'm like, listen, at some point, could you upgrade off of this?

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:18.580
And I need you to keep scanning it with your software composition analysis tool every time you check your code in to make sure you are not calling that dangerous function.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:27.240
So if you switch it around and you are no going to prod, but as long as it's not reachable, then we're not causing legit business risk.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.280
But I do want it in the backlog because at some point I'd like you to upgrade off.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.640
But like, let's say it's a medium.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.620
It's like there's so many bugs that I want people to fix.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.620
And some of them aren't even bugs.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.200
Like some of them are, I want you to use content security policy header.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.640
Is that a bug that you're not using it?

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.280
In my heart it is, but technically no.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.620
But it's an additional layer of security that basically stops cross-site scripting in its tracks.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.160
Right.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:23:06.880
And so I'd rather spend my social currency getting like the entire organization to adopt CSP than to fit like upgrade off of tons of different dependencies that aren't actually hurting anyone.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.840
Yeah, I agree.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.900
I think that makes a lot of sense.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.920
This is why security people yell at me.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:12.940
Yeah.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:17.100
Once you've solved all the other security problems, you can come back to the unreachable ones, right?

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.520
Yeah, for sure.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.360
Yeah.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.460
I want to dive into your book and you've got a bunch of good recommendations.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.100
But before I do, I just have a quick question.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:31.740
What do you think, you know, the White House last year or beginning of this year released a thing saying we call for memory safe languages.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.520
And I know you started in C and C++.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.060
I also started C++.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.940
I was kicked a Fortran kicking and screaming for a little while and went back to it and then moved on.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.580
But, you know, we got a lot more options these days, right?

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:53.020
And I know folks at the PSF were actually working with the people at the White House to encourage them to consider Python as one of the options.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.200
But what do you think about this and its implications?

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.680
Oh, a lot of software is written in C.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.540
A lot.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.300
Like, maybe half.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:06.520
Like, it's nuts how much is written of our whole world is written in C.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.440
And they're like, oh, future software.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:16.940
So, if we're writing brand new software, yeah, I wouldn't write it in C unless I absolutely had to.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.340
I would try to use Rust.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.440
But do I think that everyone's going to suddenly, like, rewrite everything into Rust?

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.020
No, I don't believe that.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.140
And it's because of a lot of reasons.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:34.520
One, like, I'm told it's difficult to develop in Rust because basically there's, like, no libraries for it compared to C.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.980
C is so rich.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.900
There's so many options in C, C++, right?

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.120
Because it's been around forever.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:46.620
There's a zillion code samples that you can copy from and then paste into your code, which you should not do unless you understand it fully.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.000
Yeah.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.040
So many comments there.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.380
So, memory safety.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.600
Like, if you are going to write a new app, I want it to be memory safe.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.740
Yes, absolutely.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.120
Do I expect everyone to rewrite all the old code?

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.320
No, no one's going to do that.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.580
No one can afford to do that.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.000
No.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.960
But I'd love to see, like, a framework over top of C and C++ that provided memory safety.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.100
That would be amazing.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.800
I'd pay for that, right?

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.880
Like, a library that just, like, I collect your garbage and you don't have to think about it anymore.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.780
Right?

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.000
Like, that would be beautiful.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.620
That would solve, that would do a lot of backwards compatibility if we started turning that on in my brain.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.980
Yeah, you talked about the remote code execution issues.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:38.440
A lot of that has to do with exceeding a buffer we've allocated, using a freed buffer before the pointer was gone.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.940
Like, a lot of it has to do with this memory ownership and stuff that you're talking about.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.340
Yeah, and sometimes mismanagement of objects as well.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.640
And so, basically, you know, you make a memory.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.820
Can I explain this?

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.380
Or is this, like, way below?

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:51.660
Okay.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.060
So, we can overflow an integer, a string, a buffer.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:00.240
But basically, like, you declare a variable of some form.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.740
And let's say you're like, oh, my string's 20.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.300
Cool.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.720
If you put 25 in there, where do you think that extra 5 goes?

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.300
Right?

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.000
Next bit of execution, probably.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.140
Yeah, it goes somewhere else.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.120
Or a heap or something, yeah.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.760
Yeah, it goes somewhere else in the stack or the heap.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.340
And guess what?

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.920
If you happen to do enough of it, you'll find the stack pointer.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.380
And guess what the stack pointer does?

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.840
It tells you where the next instruction is.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.120
And what if I tell it where the next instruction is and it's in my overflow?

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:34.200
And what if I've added my own shell code with instructions to do bad stuff, like open a web prompt?

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.760
I would like a shell, please.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.060
A shell would be nice.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:37.720
Thank you.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:46.020
And then you can execute code on their server remotely, which is the RCE worst in the world thing we do not want to have happen.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.540
And this is because of memory safety.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:53.100
Because it's not automatically checking the bounds for us.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:59.420
And because we ourselves have not done perfect input validation, which is a hard thing to get right.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.820
I was teaching it today.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:06.120
And literally, we spent one hour and 15 minutes just on input validation.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.280
And they had a trillion questions.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:14.280
And a lot of them were like, yeah, but we don't need to do input validation if it's just internal, right?

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.820
And I'm like, are you handling the employee paychecks?

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.140
Do you want me to see your employee paychecks?

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.000
Then you probably need to validate.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.720
So I'm a slippery fish.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.080
Yeah.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:31.120
Are you reading from the database that somebody else could have gotten into and leveled up?

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.440
Yeah.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.820
There is a lot there, Michael.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.900
There's so much.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.980
It's not good.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.380
It's a negotiation, though, right?

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.500
And it's about persuasion.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.700
And it's about what their threat model looks like.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:47.800
Because if you're handling hundreds of millions of dollars a day, your threat model is very different than I used to work at a place.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:54.460
And their entire job was to show videos to nurses and doctors that they had to watch each month so they could continue their certification.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.240
And it was like, did they see the video or did they not see it?

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.960
Threat model low.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.960
Yeah.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.740
You don't want people to mess it up and pollute it or whatever or take it down.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.060
But at the same time, it's not going to make the front page of the news.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.240
Exactly.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.340
Exactly.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.200
We now know.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:16.720
Everyone we know that Nurse 7725 has not been up to date.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.800
I mean, it's not great, but it's not the same as social security numbers and all that.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.380
Exactly.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.020
Yeah.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:24.700
All right.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.820
Let's talk about your book.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.400
I think your book is really good.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.120
Yes.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:33.820
Now, to be clear, specifically the Alice and Bob Lawrence Cure Coding, because I haven't read the other book.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.900
But if it's in the same style, it seems to me, I'm sure it's also good.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:37.880
Tell us about your books.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.340
Thank you.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.220
So my new book's called Alice and Bob Lawrence Cure Coding.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.580
And I'm dyslexic.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.300
And I'm about to get diagnosed for ADHD, too.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.460
Because why not?

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.100
They go so well together.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:52.400
Yay.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:57.800
And so when I read a textbook, I find it really hard.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.200
So I read a zillion books.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.520
Like, I love books.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.760
Sitting still is hard for me.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.600
Reading a textbook, I find really, really hard.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.960
I want that knowledge to be in my brain very badly.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.960
But sitting my butt still for eight hours is really difficult.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.900
And I found traditional textbooks really difficult.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:21.540
So I started blogging because someone double dog dared me when I worked at Microsoft.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.940
And what else could I do, right?

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.020
There's no way out.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:25.800
They've done it.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.820
I know.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.660
There's nothing I could do.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.600
Brock, you faded me into a corner.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.300
But I just kept blogging and blogging.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.560
And people kept telling me I should write a book.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.260
And publishers started reaching out to me.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.960
I'm like, yeah, but my blog's very casual language.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.780
I use a lot of examples with Alice and Bob.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:48.160
Alice and Bob were used by mathematicians to explain cryptography to normal people.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.260
So Alice wants to tell Bob a secret.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.040
How does Bob know it was Alice?

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.540
And so I just kept using them because we all use them.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.060
And so basically, Wiley approached me.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.040
And they're like, yeah, you can write the weirdest textbook in the whole world.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.620
I'm like, because Alice is going to date people.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.080
He's like, okay.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:15.560
So my first book was for AppSec engineers and people that want to work in application security

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.920
because there was no book of how to do that.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.880
So I wrote a book for past me.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.780
And so then when I thought about Alice and Bob having a sequel, I was like, I want to write

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.520
a book for really past me for when I was a software developer.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.020
And so I was like, what should I cover?

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:38.620
And so I covered the 10 top programming languages and the eight most popular frameworks within

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.500
reason.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:45.960
So like some frame, like it was hard to pick the frameworks because I was like, oh, I was

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.980
thinking about that when I was reading.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.880
I'm like, oh yeah, these are, it's not so easy.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.820
It was hard.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.540
And so I asked a lot of my followers.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:57.260
And so you might disagree with me about the frameworks I chose, but I really liked .NET.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.720
So it was obviously going to be in there.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.720
Flask, obviously going to be in there.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.680
But I was like, should I put pandas in here?

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.780
Or should I put, I put in jQuery and my advice is don't use jQuery.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.040
Yeah.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.200
But document ready was so good.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:12.640
Come on.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:18.460
And so, so it was hard to choose.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:25.620
And then I wanted to cover like all the different agnostic programming advice, because to be quite

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:30.080
blunt, there's a lot of stuff like input validation that applies to every single language in the

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.380
world and every framework.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.420
It just doesn't matter.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.080
And I don't care if some of them say they do some input validation for you.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:36.780
It's not enough.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:37.820
Trust me.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.000
And so I wanted, so like the first third of the book is just completely agnostic.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.960
And I've been giving secure coding training basically since before the first book.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:52.220
And I just keep refining it and refining it and improving and improving it.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.520
And I was like, well, I have a lot to say on this subject now.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.260
And so then I asked all my followers, like, what do you want to see in the book?

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.600
And they added a bunch of things.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.460
Like, they're like, oh, I want to see this topic.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.360
I want to see that topic.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.640
So it got even bigger.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:13.140
But then the end of the book, the last third is the system development lifecycle, all the

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.020
security steps, but from a developer's point of view.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:20.560
Because when I was a dev, it was like, why am I being subjected to this?

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.500
Like, what's a threat model?

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:27.980
I remember being in a meeting and this woman was like, you want to do a penetration test on

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:28.380
me?

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.380
And then she turned bright red and was like, I don't know if I should be in this meeting.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.640
I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.620
She's like, I was talking.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.660
I'm not a doctor.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.440
This is going to be fun.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:41.740
I know.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:42.440
I know.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.860
I was like, your web app, your web app.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.920
She's like, you just used a lot of words that were uncomfortable.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.200
I'm like, I'm so sorry.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.820
And so it's like, what to expect when a penetration test happens or like in a threat model, like

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.200
bring your awesome ideas of how you would hack your app.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.920
And like, this is maybe how much will be expected from you.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:08.920
And why we like, what all these tools are and what they do and how you might want to use

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.360
them.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.680
Because I feel like sometimes we just, I've heard a lot of security teams say to me, well,

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.700
they should know.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.980
I'm like, do you think if they knew they would have done that thing?

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:18.420
No.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.720
Did you, did you tell them it explicitly?

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.220
Well, I felt it was implied.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.660
Dude, that's not good enough.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:29.360
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Bluehost.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.600

Since you're listening to my show, you probably know Python, but sometimes it's better to focus

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.740
on what you're creating rather than a custom built website and add another month till you

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.500
launch your idea.

Visit talkpython.fm/bluehost right now and get started today.

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.700
And thank you to Bluehost for supporting the show.

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:31.980
Yeah, I totally agree with you.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.860
And there's a really, let me do a quick search.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.360
There's a really interesting fact, at least from the Python space.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:44.080
If you look at the latest survey from the PSF and the JetBrains, how long have you been programming?

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.700
There's a little one somewhere.

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:45.920
Yeah.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.500
How long have you been programming professionally?

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.800
33% less than a year.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:57.220
And if you look at less than two years, that's 50, that's half of the people doing software just

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:57.780
got started.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.120
They probably don't even get the little Bobby table jokes, you know?

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.220
Yeah, I know.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.700
They need to read XKCD.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.200
Yes, I know.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.540
But, you know, seriously, they, how are they supposed to know?

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.880
They're struggling to just figure out how does it compile?

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.640
Where do I get a virtual environment?

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.180
Why won't I import that thing?

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:18.300
They're, they're just, they're not at the place where they're, they're polishing it and

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.040
they're, they're protecting.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.580
They haven't had the experience of, oh, I put it on the internet.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.700
I was hacked in eight seconds.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.320
You know?

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.500
It hurts, man.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:32.500
I remember, so the guy that became my mentor, he gave a talk for my dev team because I ran

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.440
the community of practice where I work.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.960
Shocker, me being an extrovert wanting to run a community of practice.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:44.080
And so I invited him to come and talk and he took one of our apps and he was at the login

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.480
screen and he's like, I'm going to break into your app without a password and it's going

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.900
to take over a minute just because I'm talking.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:55.360
And then he just did an SQL injection and he just got in and I was like, what?

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.480
No, no, no, no, no.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.320
And then he was like telling us.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:05.680
And then of course, like all the SQL codes going in my head and I'm like, oh my gosh,

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.900
that is very bad.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:14.200
What if my name, what if my name was quote dash, no quote, semicolon, drop tables, semicolon,

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:14.880
dash, dash.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.580
That's an, that's an interesting name, isn't it?

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.060
Right.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.540
We all, we all have special names, but yeah.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:27.960
So, I for, I forgot when you asked about my book, part of why it is weird is I try to

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.100
make it casual language.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.660
So it's really easy to understand.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.040
Yeah.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.260
And I try to get, honestly, I didn't, I didn't put that together, but I had that experience

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.800
reading it.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.100
So I think you nailed it.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.740
Thank you.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:43.440
And I try to use like different ways of explaining the same thing, like with a story and then

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.760
like the technical explanation.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:51.280
And then maybe, there's like a funny story from Alice and Bob, cause Alice will not

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.300
put up with unethical dates with pen testers.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.720
And Bob really worships this really cool guy.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:04.840
Um, and like seeing it, how it applies to people's real lives, I felt like hit home with

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.700
a lot of people.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:11.920
Um, and so, yeah, I just, I want, I feel like security can be really hard and I was like,

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.200
how can I make it a lot easier for people?

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.640
So that was my goal with the book.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.360
Both of them.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:16.480
Yeah.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:16.860
Yeah.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.480
Well, I think it's, I think it's really approachable.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.980
So I want to pull up a few quotes out of it that I thought we could sort of riff on that

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.100
I think would be fun here.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:32.100
So you start out the book by talking about humans and how humans are implicitly trusting

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.340
of each other in general, right?

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:34.800
In general.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.200
But you know, that's why we have societies and groups rather than every time we see a

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.860
person, we either run away or attack, you know, like that's just not how it works to

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:43.540
be a person.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.040
Right.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:50.500
And that trust is not necessarily appropriately transferred to computer systems and communication

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.840
systems and all.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.200
Right.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:58.740
So you gave some examples of implicit trust and you also gave a warning or an important

00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.060
news.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.160
Maybe tell us about this bit.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.420
So basically when we started designing things, like we didn't even have passwords at first.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:11.140
Like I remember in college, my sister telling her friend, my sister's so crazy.

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.220
She has a password on her computer.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.340
Like who wants to log into your stupid computer?

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.740
And she thought I was-

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.860
What are you working at a bank?

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.540
Come on.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:19.980
Right.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.320
And so now we all have passwords on our computers.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:30.280
And, but we design our systems the way that our society operates with implicit trust.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.160
Like just imagine like someone comes to your door with a package and they ring the doorbell,

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.440
you open it.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:41.760
But in the animal kingdom, which I have watched a lot of nature documentaries because I have small

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.740
children at home, panthers, if they see another panther, it's going down.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.960
They're going to fight or make a new baby panther or both.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.220
That is what happens in the animal kingdom.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.840
Um, and so like they have no trust.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.280
Like some of them like try to kill each other after they try to make baby panthers.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.660
Like they're all over the place because they have no implicit trust.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.860
So you see them alone a lot.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:11.280
And so when we started designing networks, one of the things we would do is we would, first

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.000
of all, a lot of networks in this world today are still flat, which means one firewall around

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.420
the outside and that's it.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:22.180
So if you can get to anything in the network, you can get to everything in the network.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.900
And that is an implied trust.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:28.880
So then we came up with zoning, like the data, the databases are all in one zone and there's

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.020
a firewall around that.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.000
And then we have like a public access zone.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.580
And then we have a deep militarized zone because we think we're badasses, et cetera.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:36.220
Right.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:42.540
And, but what happened is if you have an SQL injection, you've gotten behind the firewall and now you

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.460
can get to every single database in the entire organization.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.340
You have hit the gold mind.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.240
Right.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.540
So that is bad.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.960
Um, and then we came up with zero trust.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.900
The idea of everything is closed by default.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:59.200
And unless there's a business requirement, you don't open it.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:39:59.860
Right.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:06.780
So, let's say you have a database and an API and it has a front end and then you have

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.860
a service account for those.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:11.160
So the service account only can talk to those three things.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.740
Oh, and it can talk to the secret management tool to get your secrets because you store your

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.140
secrets in a correct place.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.580
You don't put those in source code and just check them in the GitHub.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:23.200
Please do not do that.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.040
Um, I only do that when I'm trying to prove a point.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:35.920
But, but then ideally the API checks that who's calling it is its front end and not someone

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.320
else.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:36.620
Right.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:39.620
And then it authenticates and authorizes to the database.

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.800
And we have, and nothing else.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.480
No one else can call that API.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.920
Why would you be calling it unless you're a malicious actor or you're a tester?

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.480
Right.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.880
So once the testing phase is over, we're in production, no one else should be talking

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.160
to it.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.400
So you only accept connections from there.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.560
And if, if we do zero trust perfectly, it is amazing.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:05.260
But quite often, we have partial implementations because it's quite a lot of work to implement.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:08.420
And if you get it wrong, it can be painful.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.040
Yeah.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.400
Yeah.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.920
What do you think about, things like thinks to canaries and those types of things?

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.220
Maybe tell me what that is real quick.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.000
Yeah.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.940
So, there's this guy named Harum Mia who goes on risky business all the time, which is

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.440
a podcast.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:26.960
I like.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.300
It's a good podcast.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:28.820
Yeah.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.220
Patrick Gray and Alex.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.800
What's the guy's first name?

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.340
It's not Alex.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:32.620
Is it?

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:37.200
Um, I thought the guy, like the, is it Nick, the guy that he chats with?

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.140
I haven't listened to it in like a year.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:39.620
Yeah.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:39.960
I'm sorry.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.400
Last name below, but first name, forget it.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.500
Anyway, they, they do a good show.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:43.680
Yeah.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.500
So yeah, go on.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.660
They're really good.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.500
It is a fun show and they're so like catty.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.080
I love it.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.500
Like they make fun of everything.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.360
Nothing is sacred.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.140
It's so fun.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:52.760
Absolutely.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:58.360
But basically, things canary, the company that Harum Mina works for,

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.120
which why I've heard so much about it.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.020
Cause he's always on the show.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:05.440
They make, basically like these things that go on your network.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.000
So for instance, it could be like a fake word file.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.380
Um, it could be a, some sort of fake file somewhere on your network.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:17.640
And then you see if it gets stolen and shows up somewhere cause it calls home.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:25.340
And so people go, so imagine like you have a data breach and then you can see because it

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.960
phones home or you search the internet all the time to look for that.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.800
And you see, Oh crap, that's there.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.940
I actually was on stack overflow today.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.500
Um, as a viewer, cause I'm banned for life.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.540
That's a long story.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.680
I tried to answer all the SunGrap questions in one day and they didn't like it.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.180
I feel like they should give you an award, not a ban, but okay.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.180
I know it's a, I agree.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:47.660
Right.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.140
Some of my answers, they didn't like, like, don't suppress that result.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.060
You have cross-site scripting.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.040
Here's how you fix your code.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.780
They're like, you didn't answer his question.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.240
Down vote, down vote.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.000
But anyway, the internet can be harsh.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.200
What were you saying about this trust and well-meaning?

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:01.920
I don't know.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.980
Yeah.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:08.280
But so, so basically like this guy was saying his website keeps getting scraped by all his

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.780
competitors rather than them typing out the information himself.

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:18.320
So he puts fake musical artists into his database and then he goes to other companies and he searches

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.340
for those fake musical artists and then he sends them ceases and desists.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:30.080
And so like the idea of a canary is that like the canary in the coal mine, but basically

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.260
someone steals it.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:36.920
And then if it can, I believe that some of them can call home, but basically if they use

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.940
it somewhere, you can see it's yours.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.500
And then you're like, oh, we are in trouble.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.460
Yeah.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.520
It's an early, early alarm.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.220
You know, the canary in the coal mine sort of deal, right?

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:52.680
I think that it's a cool idea, but I think that if the canary calls out to you, you're already

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.060
pretty screwed, right?

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:54.440
Yeah.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.380
It's pretty bad.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:59.860
I think that it's cool, but it wouldn't be the first security measure I would do.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:04.760
It would be like, I have an advanced program that's like good and I want it to be super

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.380
great.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.040
Yeah.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:06.480
Yeah.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.240
Sounds good.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:07.620
All right.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:11.540
So you say, if you only learn one single thing from your book or this podcast episode,

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.960
let's put it, let's adapt it.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.020
I hope it is this.

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.460
Design every system with as little implied trust as possible.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.120
It's true.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.860
And I highlighted that in purple for you.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:20.160
How's that?

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.660
It's true.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:27.680
We want to, so in my first book, I'm like, trust no one, not even your mom, because my

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.960
mom accidentally sent me a virus one day and I opened it because it was from my mom.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.620
Oh no.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.620
And so you can't even trust your mom, even if your mom's a brilliant mathematician chemist,

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.920
because she can still get a virus on her computer.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.580
Yeah.

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.580
Because it turned out grandma sent it to her.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.460
Yeah.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.360
And she trusted grandma.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.840
Grandma's not even sophisticated enough to send a virus.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:52.420
Is she?

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:52.780
I know.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.420
Well, it turned out she was.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.820
But anyway, so don't trust anyone.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:03.060
So when you get input to your app, to your API, wherever it comes from.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.620
So that can mean getting stuff out of your database.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:12.500
So unless it's a static table that you know for sure is trusted, you should be checking the

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.280
stuff from the database.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.820
So let's say someone's like filling out a form and then you save it to the database.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:18.500
So you would want to validate those values.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.680
You save it to the database.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.320
So then let's say an API goes and get some of that data to go do stuff with it.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.600
I would validate those values again before I use that.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:33.060
And then they put it on a webpage and it has JavaScript angle brackets in it.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:33.620
Yes.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.480
Then I would output and code it before I put it out there.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.520
And I would have content security policy header and a bunch of other things.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.460
But I digress.

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:47.860
But if we could not trust anything that we get and always validate that it is what we

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:48.360
are expecting.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.980
And if it's not, we reject it.

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.420
So we don't try to fix it.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.760
Is it what we're expecting?

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.360
And so this can mean like, so let's say it's a date of birth.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.840
So is it first of all, is it a date?

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.860
Is it in the past?

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.360
Is it more than 150 years in the past?

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.580
Because that's less likely.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.900
Is it in the format you're expecting?

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.420
Those are some of the things that we could check.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:15.480
And if it's not any of, if any one of those things are wrong, reject and just say, hey,

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.540
actually we're expecting this.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.520
But let's say you need a person's name.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.760
So I work with someone named Luke O'Malley.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.560
Well, he has a single quote in his last name, which is a special character if we are going

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.720
to use an SQL database.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.000
So what am I expecting?

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.580
I'm expecting letters, lower and uppercase.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:36.500
And I'm expecting a hyphen and or a single quote.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.580
All of those are on my yes approved list, my allow list.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.900
So I check it against my allow list, not a block list.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.500
Because a block list of bad characters, guess what's going to happen?

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.680
Tanya's goes around it.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:48.920
Yep.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:49.280
Thanks.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:49.940
I'm in.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.080
Usually Unicode escape sequence forward or some random thing.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:54.720
Yes.

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.780
There's a zillion ways around it.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:02.200
And like, I remember when I learned that, how sad I was for all my past apps.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:09.320
And so you use an approved list of good stuff and you accept the single character and you

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.540
accept the hyphen and then you sanitize or escape them.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.240
So sanitize means changing it for a different value.

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:20.560
So you might want to change the hyphen to a pipe and you might, or probably not a pipe,

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.880
maybe that's still a special character.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.680
But like, let's say the carrot.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.740
And then you change the single quote to the tilde symbol.

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.340
And then those are not a problem.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.960
And then you pass that on.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.680
So you validate that's what you're expecting.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.700
And then you have either escape, sanitize it or escape them.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.320
So just put like a backslash in front of the special characters.

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:46.080
Or maybe HTML or URL encode them to that, you know, percent some numbers, which is the

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.180
quote or I don't know, whatever, whatever it resolves to.

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.580
It depends on what you want to do with it.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:54.300
So if you're going to take that and then put it into a parameter and send it to a

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.140
parameterized query, maybe, maybe you want to escape it.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.880
It's going to escape it for you when it gets there.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:04.500
There's a lot of options, but single quotes are kind of the danger zone.

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.840
So I want to be careful.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.880
They're definitely tricky.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.700
All right.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:08.860
Next section.

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.600
This is the Python section.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:17.520
So you have, as you said, a bunch of different technologies and they're quite up to date.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.840
You've got Node.js.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:23.240
You've got .NET Core, not the old crusty Windows only .NET.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.000
You've got Python, Python 3 stuff.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.680
So I think that's great.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.480
So let's talk about some of the what to do.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.420
Maybe just pick a few off this list that jump out at you that you want to talk about.

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.540
Okay.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.140
So some of them are really obvious.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.720
Like, please use Python 3.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.220
It's time to say goodbye to Python 2.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:45.140
I know that we can still love it in our hearts, but new apps need to be Python 3.

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.840
And updating our environment often.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.560
This goes for every framework.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:58.600
One thing is, is if you find a real security bug, reporting it to the security folks from Python, that is a valuable thing to do.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:06.840
Whatever programming language or framework you're in, if you feel you found a real legit bug, you should support it or you should report it.

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:11.980
Because as a result, when they fix it, they're fixing it for thousands and thousands and thousands of devs.

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.920
And you are a wonderful human.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.360
So that is that.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:15.540
Pay it forward.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.120
Yeah.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:20.100
And I want to give a shout out to the PSF and Python folks.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:26.320
They've made a lot of efforts in putting more time and energy into the security at Python.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:32.780
Both Mike Fiedler got hired as the security person behind PyPI, the package index.

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:37.440
And Seth Larson got hired for more broadly Python security.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.040
Hopefully I've characterized that right.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.500
But we now have two full-time people working on it.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:45.900
Whereas before it was kind of core devs and other people contributing their spare time.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.300
Hopefully they could grab it, you know?

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.160
So that's good.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:57.300
And you point out that there's a security at python.org email address for legitimate reports and not hassling busy people.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:57.780
Yes.

00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:58.780
Don't hassle them.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.000
Test and make sure it's repeatable.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.060
Like these people are very busy.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:06.480
There are so many things.

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.240
So one of the things was, so like let's say you're taking, because we're talking about user input.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:16.460
And we're taking, so the bottom of that page, we're taking user input as a string from your code.

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:23.220
And we can use the template class from the string module rather than other functions for string manipulation.

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:26.100
So if we do that, it's safer.

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.500
There's less string overloads.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:36.700
Like if we avoid using, for instance, fstring and string format for handling user input, because that can be manipulated by the user.

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:43.660
So it sounds weird, but like using the template class from the string module can't be manipulated as easily.

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:44.260
Interesting.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.920
Yeah, I know.

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.740
I had to do a lot of research for this.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:48.640
I bet.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.480
Yeah.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:59.820
And they just added a new type to the Python type system called a literal string, which works for SQL for things that are not meant to accept user input.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:06.560
So if you had a literal string, that was a query and you combined it with stuff that came from a regular string, like a user input.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.060
That's a query.

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.420
It will fail the type system basically.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.320
It still runs.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.580
That's the way Python types work.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.800
But at least you would check it with a mypy type of checker.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.740
That is very cool.

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:18.800
That's pretty neat.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.500
There's not too many tools to support it, but the static type checkers do.

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:26.200
Another one I think that's worth calling out here is you talked about, be sure you pin your dependencies.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.880
Yes.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.180
I'm like looking through all of the notes.

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.360
You have them.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.560
Pinning.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:42.320
So I got into like a lot of arguments with my technical editors about this one.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:54.020
So you want to pin your dependencies, like as you're going through all the different environments and not allow it to update out when you get to prod, because otherwise you're all testing different versions.

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:54.540
Right.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:59.940
So you want to make sure you're using the same one across the board that you're testing, because otherwise your tests aren't accurate.

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:00.420
Right.

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:01.240
Yeah.

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:08.000
It might be the same, or it could be an important library got an update between when you checked it in and when it got built to a Docker container or something.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:08.640
And it's different.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:15.020
But the other thing is, is that you don't want it to be permanently like that forever.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:19.060
And so like when you're, so it sounds weird.

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:23.360
So you pin it there, but then I can't remember where it is.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:29.080
I think the, I think the big distinction is, are you building an application or are you building a library?

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:32.960
People are building applications with, because your application should pick its versions.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:39.120
But if you pick them concretely for the library, you're forcing potentially old vulnerable versions onto people.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:39.640
Right.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.720
There's this tension of, of what role am I playing, which I think is tricky.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.400
Yes.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:51.700
So ideally, like if you're like about to go to prod with something, you don't want it changing in different environments.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:52.840
That could be really bad.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.800
But yeah, like you said, pinning the version.

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.560
Well, I'm just like reading it on the screen.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:04.700
We, so I remember like I was installed, I was doing like a proof of concept with this company.

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:10.380
And in order to install it, it wanted me to downgrade a bunch of NPM dependencies.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:16.360
And then it showed me that there were huge vulnerabilities in those dependencies that they'd asked me to use.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.280
And I was like, well, like deal breaker buddy.

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:18.820
Right.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:28.080
And so when you are creating like a product for someone, if they can see that and how it's compiled, like that's a deal breaker for a lot of customers.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.060
Customers are very savvy in regarding security right now.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.660
And I love it.

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:34.020
Yeah.

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:34.700
It's really good.

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:47.820
And even putting security aside, you can end up, if you have two libraries, they both use a sub library, a dependency, and they have different pin versions or ones less than or greater than or less than or equal to the other is greater than equal to.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.420
And there's no intersection of those numbers.

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.120
You just, you're like, well, I can't run this.

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:57.320
I guess we just can't use these because it'll say, I can't give you both greater than two and less than two at the same time.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:57.580
Right.

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:58.340
It's a hassle.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.080
But the security bid is also important, obviously.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.000
I agree.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:02.420
Let's see.

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:02.860
Yeah.

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.140
So Bandit.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.680
Bandit's an interesting tool.

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:14.120
Bandit is a free static analysis tool that specifically is made for Python.

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:21.960
And so some of the, so for instance, if you're using Ruby, there's Breakman and it's made just for Ruby and that's it.

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.260
So it's awesome because it only cares about your language.

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:31.420
Because it's free and open source, there's not a giant security team behind it supporting it.

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:36.360
But if you have never used a static analysis tool, this is an excellent place to start.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.020
It's recommended over and over and over again.

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:45.340
When I teach secure coding in this, I have like this list of free Python resources.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:46.680
People love Python.

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.700
People make a lot of tools for it because they love it.

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.740
And Bandit is like really popular.

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:52.400
Yeah.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:52.960
That's awesome.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.140
And it has a cool logo.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.380
It is very cute.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.680
It is very cute.

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:01.720
I like how they call it a security linter.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.920
I would say it's a bit more like stack analysis.

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:12.060
Because like it definitely is trying to find like sources and syncs, like doing flow analysis.

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.720
I don't know if it does symbolic execution.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.600
Like I haven't seen like under the hood.

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:23.940
So like when you buy like a SaaS tool, there's like first generation and second generation and like different ways that they work.

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:28.260
And I'd love to know more under the hood of how it works.

00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.380
Yeah.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:29.920
Yeah.

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:31.600
It looks really cool.

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:40.980
You know, it'll find common things like pickle issues or parsing YAML that might be bad or, you know, all the different things that you're still allowed to do.

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:45.840
But people decided probably are not the best choices, but we'll leave it there so we don't break things that are doing it.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:46.780
But don't do it.

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:52.140
Kind of like the pointer safe string copies in C++.

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.760
Don't copy like you used to.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.200
Like, well, yeah.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.360
How do I do it now?

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.740
And I don't even know anymore, you know?

00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:02.880
I feel too that like, so it's called security linter rather than stack analysis.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.660
I feel like it also focuses on code quality and not just security.

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:11.780
And that's helpful too, because if you have higher quality code, it's just going to be more secure.

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:14.320
It's going to be easier to maintain, easier to debug.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.240
So if there is a security problem, you can address it faster.

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.580
You have less technical debt if you have higher quality code.

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.440
So that's a win as well.

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.260
Absolutely.

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:23.960
All right.

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:29.200
Let's talk about SQL relational databases, these kinds of things a little bit.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:34.900
I think there's, you know, the majority of people out there have an app that talks to a database.

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.100
That database is relational.

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.180
Usually it's running on its own server.

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:38.680
Yeah.

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:43.180
And when things go bad, it's usually the data that came out of the server that makes the news.

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.400
Not always, but usually.

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.280
Yeah.

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.880
But it can be the server.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:52.240
So an SQL server is a server, right?

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:53.560
So it is a server.

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.580
You need to patch it.

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:55.920
You need to keep it up to date.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.540
You need to harden it.

00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:59.280
It comes with a hardening guide.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.660
You should do all the steps in the hardening guide.

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:05.420
You should make sure that every single person you work with cannot access it.

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:05.820
Right?

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:10.460
Like, it seems really obvious, but you would be surprised.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:17.040
So like basic server hygiene applies to them.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:25.480
On top of that, then the SQL software, the SQL server software itself, it can be hardened as well.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:29.800
And that might sound odd, but like it has updates that it needs.

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:37.180
So you want to make sure that you have locked it down the way that you think that you should.

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:38.640
Yeah.

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.040
Then on top of-

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.280
And it can run in different users as well, right?

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:49.460
It's easy to, it's easiest if it just runs as root, but wouldn't it be better if it, in case somebody gets to it and breaks in through it, right?

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:52.600
You don't want them to use it as a lateral movement.

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:56.120
You know, first they got into the server and then they went over to, you know, who knows where.

00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:04.820
We also want to make sure, ideally, that people are not accessing it with database owner unless they're the database owner, right?

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.880
Like ideally, DBO users are used rarely.

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:14.160
Like let's say you're using MS SQL server, yeah, that has database owner privileges.

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.680
I get it because you're a database administrator.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:22.480
But if your app or your API is accessing the database, we want to use a least privilege approach.

00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:25.720
So if you're just doing select statements, just do a read-only user.

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:31.160
If you're doing CRED, create, read, update, delete, then you should use a read-write user.

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:35.800
But DBO is not almost ever actually needed, if we think about it.

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.380
And so if you don't have that, then less can happen that is bad, right?

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:39.540
Right.

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:42.460
Does it need access to every table or just these 10 tables?

00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:43.300
Mm-hmm.

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.320
Exactly.

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:52.460
Another thing is like classifying the data that's in each table as sensitive or not sensitive.

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.480
And maybe you work for the government.

00:58:54.480 --> 00:59:00.120
So maybe it's like classified or secret or top secret or whatever your organization uses.

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:04.000
But if you could classify those things and then label them.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.160
A lot of databases now have labels for sensitivity, which is awesome.

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.960
But if not, just add an extra field.

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.380
If not just like add a field called sensitivity.

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:18.620
And then it's just like public or unclassified or super secret.

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:19.560
Don't show people.

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:26.480
And when you do that, it makes life so much better if there is a security incident.

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:30.760
Because I know if I need to freak out a little or if I need to freak out a lot.

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:37.940
And if it's not labeled, I have to assume the absolute worst when I respond until I know it's a lower threat.

00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:40.140
And that really sucks.

00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:41.320
Yeah.

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.940
Yeah, for sure.

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:47.260
Another thing that you called out in this section is make sure that logging is turned on.

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:49.840
And you need to do this before something goes bad.

00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:53.320
Because it's the logs that tell you what happened.

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.480
Yes.

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.900
I think not just for databases, but across the board.

00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:59.380
Logging is super important.

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.040
Oh, yeah.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.280
I have a whole giant section in the book about what to log, what not to log, when to log.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.840
Like exactly what I would love a log to look like, how to protect your logs.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.680
I had a customer and they're like 28 of our customers.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.820
Their credit cards got nicked and Visa called us.

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:21.840
And they want us to prove that it wasn't us.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.880
And I'm like, great, let's go get the logs.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.400
They're like, we kind of deleted those.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.620
You know, they're hard to back up.

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.680
I said, what?

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:34.540
And they're like, well, we just switched to a new server four months ago.

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.640
And so we just deleted the old server.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.720
So like, and we just did that.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.160
So like for four months, we have no records.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.500
And I said, oh my gosh.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:49.320
And so luckily it turned out there was a sandwich shop in the same building and they caught an

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.460
employee was skimming the cards.

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.400
And so Visa's like, we figured it out.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.380
And we're like, great.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.620
I'm like, we're all getting fired.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:04.420
Because if Visa yanks your ability to use it and your main way of making money is charging

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:05.340
money over the internet.

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:10.660
Like you've just reduced your ability to do the main purpose of capitalism.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.840
Yeah.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.920
Life is, you do not want to take off Visa or MasterCard.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.560
Don't do it.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.700
All that stuff is definitely, it's definitely unnerving.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.820
Let's see some more advice.

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:27.560
You got using ORM if you can, because it, they basically are not immune, but they have a lot

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.220
of automatic guards against.

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.300
You're not writing direct string.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.160
So it's harder to concatenate that stuff.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:33.480
Yeah.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:38.500
They will also do a lot of the code for you, depending upon the one that you use.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:41.500
Like I've used the entity relationship framework with .NET.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.400
It's like, I'm going to write all your gets and sets and do this and that for you.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.060
I'm like, oh, sweet.

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:45.660
Thanks, buddy.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.280
And even your migrations and stuff.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:47.500
Yeah.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.720
It's pretty nice.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.440
Yeah.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.800
I'm a fan.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.280
I'm a believer.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.400
I know some people say, oh, it's a little bit slower, whatever.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.600
Like, yeah, but I like getting stuff done and sleeping at night.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.100
Yeah.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.800
So another one I think is really worth pointing out.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.920
Most important for databases, but also just generally good idea.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.260
Have an extensive and well thought out backup plan and try to back up something at least

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.520
once or try to restore something at least once.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.700
Yes.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:18.960
I worked somewhere and we had a computer problem and they lost everyone's work in our entire

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.640
2000 person department for, for the whole week.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.960
So for like the three days, it was the Wednesday and they had lost all of our work.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.720
Everyone's work was not saved.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.840
All of it was gone.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.460
And we go to the backup guys and we're like, okay, do your thing.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:36.020
And they're like, oh, well, it'll take like at least a month.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.440
And we've never really tried it before.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.080
And we don't think it'll really work.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.760
And so you guys should just still redo it.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.980
And my boss was like, oh, I guess we have to redo it.

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:48.260
And I was like, well, can I hire two new software developers?

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:49.500
And he's like, why?

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.660
I'm like, well, because those guys are obviously fired.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:52.340
Right.

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.620
And then I can just like hire two new devs.

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:55.240
It'll be great.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.880
And he's like, Tanya, go back to your room.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.780
But I'm like, we don't need them.

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:05.180
Their job, they just proved that their job is completely worthless.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:06.700
So let's just get rid of them.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.220
And he was like, stop talking.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.260
Go, go away.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.000
I understand you're frustrated, but.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.400
That's not constructive, Tanya.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.420
If I fire them, then they're going to have to fire me because I hire.

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:16.920
No, I'm just kidding.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.900
You know, one thing that I, yeah.

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:23.880
The one thing that comes to mind though is, you know, back in the day, we had Subversion

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.340
and CVS and SourceSafe and all these things.

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.580
And if something went wrong with that, it was just gone.

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.460
It was just gone.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.560
And now we have Git.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.820
And if something goes wrong, there might be a hundred copies of it.

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:39.060
It's less bad from a software person's perspective.

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.420
Three times I have worked somewhere where they lost their code repository.

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:43.720
Yeah.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:52.960
One of the times I started and one of the employees was junior and he had just deleted it by accident.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:04:00.100
And I managed to go to each person's computer and recover a ton of the code and put a lot of

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:00.860
it back together.

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:06.200
Another time someone just deleted it and they, I feel were malicious.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:12.920
And then another time, basically we didn't want to wait for shared services.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:17.040
So the Canadian government decided we would make a department that was the IT department

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.520
for the whole government and they just wouldn't give us a server.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:24.420
So we just took a server from another room and repurposed it and decided that was our code

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:24.980
repo survey.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.620
And so I set up a whole network.

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.700
I set up active directory and all this.

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.480
I installed team foundation server.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.320
I did all the stuff.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.020
I set it all up.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:35.900
And I was like, listen, bud, I did this for you, but you need to back it up every night.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.360
And he promised me he would.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.740
And then five months later, it crashed.

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:42.040
And he's like, are you going to make it go again?

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.600
And it was a raid server.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.760
And it automatically deleted everything.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.580
Yeah.

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.840
And so I was like, well, get your backup.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.560
Get its job.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.120
It replicated.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.160
He had not backed it up a single time in five months.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:57.960
And we lost 11 contractors work for like months, like five months.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.140
I was like, I am so angry.

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.440
And he's like, could you spend this weekend making us a new?

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.400
I was like, no, I'm so angry at you.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.120
You'll make it.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.140
He's like, but I don't know how.

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:08.880
I'm like, I guess it's tough to be you.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.500
You're going to learn.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.460
You're going to learn the hard way.

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:13.320
Yeah.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.020
So we're pretty much out of time here.

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:19.680
But I do want to maybe just point out that there is a whole section on Flask, which is

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:20.160
pretty awesome.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:26.320
And you talk a lot about different extensions that you can use, like Flask Secrets for secret

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:33.800
management or Flask WTF for CSRF protection and things like that.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.560
So there's a bunch of stuff in there.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.620
People want to go check that out.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.520
But I think we might need to call it for time.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.040
But yeah, this is good stuff.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:45.280
If you want to learn more besides obviously purchasing all of my books, I have a free online

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.740
academy at academy.semgrep.dev.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:52.640
I don't know if you want me to spell it because that's like...

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:58.640
I'm going to...

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.000
I'll find it.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:00.400
I'll find it.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:00.600
There.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:04.700
Oh, it's like it's through my full-time job.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.460
So I train on the side and I do stuff for them full-time.

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.100
But I put it in our private chat.

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:12.760
And basically, I have a free secure coding course in there.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.160
It's a few years old.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.780
Like the book is all brand new stuff.

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.620
It covers like agnostic, you know, how to do input validation, how to do output encoding,

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:27.220
how to make sure that you are using parameterized queries, how to configure every single security

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:27.560
header.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.700
And it's just free.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:35.000
And I do that because I need us to do better real bad.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.420
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:37.900
Yeah.

01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:38.580
Well, thank you.

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:39.160
That's awesome.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.940
Thank you.

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:41.840
Yeah.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.460
It's been a really fun conversation.

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:47.460
And I feel like we could probably talk for another two hours, but...

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:48.340
I know.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:52.380
Well, maybe in another year or two, we'll come back if you'll have me.

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:52.620
Yeah.

01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:53.280
Yeah.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:53.920
That'd be amazing.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.700
Well, let's leave it with a final call to action.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.740
People are...

01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:58.760
You have their attention.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.380
They thought, well, maybe I should validate that or learn more or do more.

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.360
What do you tell them before we wrap it up?

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:10.920
I want you to go look at whatever framework that you are using and see if there are security

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.680
features and start using them in your code.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:17.680
So if you're using Flask, there's a whole bunch of super awesome things in Flask.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.980
Please use them.

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:20.620
Your life will be better.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.640
Yeah, absolutely.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.220
Well, thank you for sharing all your experience and the story.

01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.440
That's been a lot of fun.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.300
Thank you so much for having me, Michael.

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.480
Yeah, you bet.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:29.900
Bye.
