00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.540
Have you heard that Python is not good for writing concurrent asynchronous code?

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.720
This is generally a misconception, but there is one class of parallel computing that Python is

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.380
not good at, CPU-bound work running in the Python layer. What's the main problem? It's Python's

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.700
GIL or global interpreter lock, of course. Yet the fix for this restriction might have been hiding

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.420
inside Python for 20 years, sub-interpreters. Join me to talk about PEP 554 with core developer

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.460
Eric Snow. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 225, recorded August 2nd, 2019.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.700
Talk Python to Me. Hi, how's it going? It's going really well. It's an honor to have you on the show.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.120
We met up at PyCascades and talked a little bit, but this latest work you're doing to address

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.300
concurrency and parallelism in Python is super interesting. So I'm looking forward to talking

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.080
to you about that. Well, it's super interesting to me too. Yeah, I can imagine. I'm glad you're

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.320
interested. This kind of stuff is, I don't know, there's just something that draws me in and I'm

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.260
really enjoy exploring it. But before we do, let's start with your story. How'd you get into programming

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.340
Python? Oh boy. I had all sorts of ideas on what I wanted to do growing up and computers was not

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:55.280
really one of them. But then I ended up at school and somehow ended up signed up for computer stuff,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.160
ended up getting a CS degree. And then it's funny because I actually, while I was in school, I was

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.700
working for a web hosting company doing technical support. Once I graduated, I moved over to a development

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.580
team. And the guy I replaced is, you may know him, he's named Van Lindberg.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.560
Okay. Yeah.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.940
So it's kind of funny. So I ended up working on this project that Van had been running and ultimately

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.660
ended up kind of being the tech lead on that project. It was all written in Python. And so I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.640
have Van to thank for my introduction to Python.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.800
That's really cool. So you went from talking to the customers and helping them with the problems

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.780
the developers created to creating the problems for the person who took the job.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.260
Just kidding.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.020
Kind of.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.820
Yeah. That's a really great progression, right? Like you sort of get your foot in the tech space

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.180
and then, you know, you make your way over to kind of running the team. That's great.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.680
It was a good experience. One neat thing is that it was pretty flexible as far as the job goes.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.040
There were only a handful of us on the team and we're doing a pretty big job, but we had taken an

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.760
approach of highly automating stuff. So it was mostly just a matter of making the effort to address

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.380
automation stuff, which meant that otherwise we had a little more time to kind of delve into issues and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.240
solve problems in a better way. And as part of that, whenever I'd run into Python stuff, like I couldn't

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.520
figure out what was going on or I wanted to understand how something worked, I had the time

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.880
to go and explore it. And, you know, within a year or something, I discovered the mailing lists.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.000
And then, you know, before long, I was actually active in email threads and, you know, I started

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.040
getting involved with the import system. And by 2012, so this is over the course of a few years,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.280
I got commit rights and was pretty heavily active in core development.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.480
That's so cool. I think there's something special for working for a small company. You get to touch a

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.860
lot of different things. You get this freedom that you're talking about to kind of solve the problems

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.100
the way you see they should be solved and then go and, you know, kind of explore. Right. I work for a

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.360
small company and I think I really attribute like being in that company in the early days to like a lot

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.080
of the success of my career because it gave me a chance to like round out the corners that I didn't

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.360
really know. I wasn't like just pigeonholed into like some super narrow role. Right. You work on what

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.120
this button does. That's your job. Like, right. Right. Right. Exactly. That reminds me what you

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.420
just said. That's been my experience with CPython that as I've gotten involved in the mail list and

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:37.200
the bug tracker and everything, I feel like is really rounded me out a lot because I'm exposed to

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.860
so many things, you know, the breadth of programming and just 90% of it, I probably never really would have

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.540
been introduced to because probably isn't that interesting to me, but because, you know, their

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:56.480
email threads and whatever, you know, I learned about it and that's, it's really made a huge

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.800
difference for me, I think. Yeah. I can imagine. It's just, it's an amazing group of people working

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.080
on there and then get down into the technical details. Oh yeah. So you started out and in this

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.960
web hosting company and now you work for a really big web hosting company, right? Yeah.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.020
With Azure? Oh yeah. No, not exactly. But definitely, definitely I got some web hosting

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.380
going on. What do you do day to day over at Microsoft? So I work with Brett Cannon on the

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.880
Python extension for VS Code. I joined the team a little over a year and a half ago.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.540
Nice. That's got to be a fun team to work on. You know, the excitement around VS Code is massive,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.220
right? It's, you know, I always ask this question, what's your favorite editor? What editor do you use?

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.320
Things like that in the show. And yeah, VS Code is definitely tracking as a major thing. And

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:46.260
it used to sometimes be Sublime or Atom or something. It's, it seems like certainly for like that type

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.120
of interface, what would you call it? So what would you call it? I mean, it's, it's not an IDE

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.780
really. It's not like a terminal app. What, what category of editor is our Sublime Atom VS Code?

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.840
What's the name? What should I be calling these things?

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.540
I don't know why. Like a full featured editor?

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.340
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.520
You can't call it an IDE because that's, that's verboten.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.060
Yeah. And there's not enough buttons. It needs more buttons and windows, right?

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.540
It needs more menus and more stuff so you can get lost in there, right? Right now.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.080
Yes, exactly.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.420
It's too easy not to get lost.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.840
Yeah. There's not enough floating windows. Congratulations. I'm sure that's a super

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.680
exciting thing to be working on and it's, it's really growing quickly.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.140
No, it's funny. This is a team that I first talked with them about getting on the team

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:34.940
in 2014 and it almost happened. And then there were some complications because I was only going

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.040
to work remote. At the time I was working for Canonical who makes Ubuntu. So I ended up just

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.160
kind of waiting and it took like what, two, three years or something like that. But it worked

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.700
out in the end. But that's, it's kind of a story of my life. I just kind of find a good

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.240
thing and then wait for it to work out. I'm not, I'm never really in a big hurry, which,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.900
which I suppose we'll talk about relative to the stuff I've been working on.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.140
Yeah, absolutely. So, well, that's, that's really good. And that's, that's a great project

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.140
to be working on day to day. And you said that Microsoft actually gives you a decent amount

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.740
of time to focus on CPython as well.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.020
Yep.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.220
As they do with Brett and some other folks. And that's, that's really quite, quite cool.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:25.820
Yeah. I get to work basically my Fridays. I work on exclusively on Python. So that's been

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.260
a big boost to, to what I've been able to get done.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.660
That's awesome. So you're saying the fact that we scheduled this on Friday is actually

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.160
cutting in your time to make Python better for everyone.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.800
You know, it's actually part of why I just, yeah, no, it's cool.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.620
That's the cost.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.620
Yeah. But I think awareness of what you're doing is really good because I think it can make a

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.360
big difference. So let's just talk about parallelism and concurrency and asynchronous

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:52.160
programming and stuff kind of in general and in the, in the Python space. I feel like there's a lot

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.280
of people who look at what Python does with async. They see things like the GIL and they say, well,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.560
this just doesn't work for parallelism. I'm switching to go or some, you know, some,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.060
something like that. And I feel like it's, you know, there may be situations where you got to

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.980
switch to see you, you got to switch to go, but they're like 1% of the situations where people

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.900
actually do that. Right. Like most of the time, I think that's just not taking advantage of what's

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.680
out there. So maybe like, let's just set the stage with talking about like concurrency in general.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.200
Yeah, you bet. If you look at it, the history of computing, other than really large systems,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.800
most computers have been single processor, single core until relatively recently.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.280
Yeah. Like 2005 or so, it just used to be the clock speed went up and up and up.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.720
And that was how computers got faster.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.920
So it's kind of funny because threading, sure, you can kind of logically program for different threads,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:56.760
but ultimately it was just a single thread getting switched by the OS. And that's kind of the,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.880
what you had to deal with, but it's a different story now.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.440
Yeah. And back in the early days, you didn't even have preemptive multi-threading.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.460
Oh yeah. Cooperative multi-threading, like you had to like give it up. Right. It was like in

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.300
Windows 3.1 in the early days, there was some weird stuff where like you had to be a good citizen on

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.980
the operating system to even allow that. We're kind of full circle here with async.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.960
Yeah. Async it away is exactly the same thing.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.960
Yeah. So it's kind of a conceptually the same. So it's really interesting, but now not only do we

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:32.760
have concurrency where you have to deal with matters of who's running at a given time, but now we also

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:39.020
have parallelism, which gives us performance boosts. But of course with Python, it's an issue with the

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.160
GIL, which everyone likes to complain about.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:48.260
Right. Exactly. So within a single process, you can't really, unless you are doing certain operations

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.340
that release the GIL, you can't really run more than one interpreter instruction at the same time.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.380
Right. Right. It's really a CPU bound code that suffers.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.760
Right. Yeah, exactly. So if you're talking to like databases or you're waiting on web services,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.640
all that stuff's fine, right? Like CPython interpreter, once it opens a network socket down

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.160
the C level, like while it's waiting, we'll release the GIL. And you can do those kinds of things in

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.040
parallel with threads already. Right. Yeah.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.600
Not computationally. Yeah. It's kind of funny because if you look at it and I think Guido's

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.740
mantra has always been, well, you aren't really hurt by the GIL as much as you think you are,

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:30.220
because a lot of code that we write really isn't CPU bound. Very often it's not. And especially

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:35.200
for some of the CPU bound stuff, you know, a lot of the critical stuff, people have moved into C

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:43.020
extensions anyway. There's still a set of problems that are affected by the GIL. And people have had

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.440
to work around that number of solutions. You know, asyncio is kind of one thing,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.380
but you also have multiprocessing and you have, you know, all sorts of distributed frameworks.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.920
Right. Like Dask and other types of things. Yeah.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:00.520
So all that stuff is in part, well, for distribute, it's a little different, but

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.400
part of the motivation there has just been to leverage parallelism better. So that's one of the

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:13.480
biggest complaints that people have with Python. It has been for a while, just parallelism,

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.960
multicore. And it's a bigger problem now that multiple cores are essentially ubiquitous.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.260
Right. Even here on my MacBook, if I go and ask it how many processors it has, how many cores rather,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.720
it says it has six and each of those are hyper-threaded. So as far as the OS is concerned,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.300
I effectively have like 12.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:31.600
Yeah.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.140
And yet it's super difficult to take advantage of those.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.560
Yeah. Yeah.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.140
In Python.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:41.700
Yeah. Yeah. It's just, it's really interesting. So it's funny the way things have gone and it's,

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.160
it's going to go even more, more this way. I mean, I expect that the way people program

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:52.780
will be different as we think about multiple cores more, but maybe not. I mean, because how often are

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.080
we writing, you know, CPU bound code?

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.060
I feel like there's just a couple of situations where it really matters and there are already to

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:06.200
some degree, some escape hatches, right? So the most obvious place where in Python,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.880
it really matters for computational parallelism is in data science, right? Like I've got a billion of

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.340
these things. I want to run some crazy algorithm on it and like machine learning training or whatever.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.960
But a lot of the libraries that the machine learning folks already have, have some capability

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:29.820
for, or for data science folks have, have some capability for parallelism at their lower C levels

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.460
anyway, right?

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:35.960
Yep. That's exactly right. I mean, a lot of these libraries have C extensions where they need them.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:43.180
Exactly. The other place where I feel like you really could get a lot better support is on the web.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:43.520
Yeah.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:50.940
Right. Like we have some of the newer frameworks, we have Molten and Jepronto and Starlette and all these things,

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:59.320
Responder that let us write async def, some web method and truly leverage the asyncio components there.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:06.120
But, you know, the main ones, Flask, Django, others, Pyramid, whatever, they don't, right?

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.760
They're all WSGI based and it's, you just can run into issues, right?

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:16.240
I mean, I know the web servers themselves have some capability just to parallelize it out, but it's still, it's, it would be much easier if you did.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.360
So I don't think it's that big of a problem.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:26.200
Like there's these two areas, the data science space, and I think the sort of like high-end web serving space that could be handled a little bit better.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:26.560
Yeah.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.240
We're already seeing some stuff with async and away on the web, which is, I think, where it's appropriate.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:43.360
I think there's one important caveat too, and it's something that we, we don't really bring up a whole lot in the community, which is that there are a lot of enterprise users of Python that we never hear about how they're using it.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:49.240
In part because of, you know, competitive advantage and that sort of thing, but we don't really hear about it.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.460
Yeah.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.680
Or they just, they just don't go to the conferences and they don't like spend all their time on Twitter.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.300
They just see it as a job.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.040
They do their work.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.580
They go home.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.740
Like they don't, not also their hobby necessarily.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:58.980
Yeah.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.160
Yeah.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:07.280
So in a lot of those cases, performance matters and not just performance, of course, efficiency and, and that sort of thing.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.120
I mean, it really adds up.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:18.740
So I'm sure there are a lot of folks that we don't even think about who would benefit from better multi-core support in CPython.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.360
But, you know, we just, we don't hear about those folks.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.340
Well, maybe that's not even them directly.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:24.940
Right.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:25.180
Yeah.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.580
Maybe they, they pip install a thing and that thing now works better and they don't even know that it's using multi-core support.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.160
Right.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:37.240
But somebody who's really clever found a way to make something they were doing much, much better using that.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:37.500
Right.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:37.240
This work that you're approaching basically tries to deal with this limited,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:46.320
implementation of the Python's guild, the global interpreter lock, which basically has the effect of what I said before, that only a single interpreter instruction can run at a time.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:54.100
Maybe some low level C stuff can also happen, but like the stuff that you write runs, you know, only one like bytecode instruction at a time, basically.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.440
Yeah.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.660
So maybe just tell people like, that sounds bad.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.300
But it's here for a reason, right?

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.680
It solves a lot of problems for us, right?

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.240
Oh yeah.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:15.340
It hides a lot of problems that you face when dealing with threads that you don't have to worry about in Python.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.720
But not only that, it's also when you're writing C extensions.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.120
In C, you have to do a lot of stuff yourself.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.320
And when you're dealing with threads, you have to deal with all that.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:34.140
So when you're using Python and you're holding the GIL, you don't have to worry about other Python threads.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:42.920
You don't have to manage your own locks for those threads, which is, I think, makes a threading at the C level in the C API easier.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:52.580
But also, there's a lot of implementation details in CPython that depend on the fact that the GIL protects them.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.560
We deal with re-entrancy a lot.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:05.580
But other than that, we don't really have to worry about race conditions on any of the C types, the built-in types or any of those, because they're protected by the GIL.

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:06.380
Yeah, which is great.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.300
And the GIL is largely a memory management thing.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.080
It's not initial job.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.460
I mean, it is for threading, but it's mostly to protect the memory management and making that thread safe, right?

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:21.180
In large part, it's to protect the runtime state, especially memory management.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:21.500
Yeah.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:21.800
Yeah.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.980
So it serves this important role.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:34.980
I mean, we still do have R-lock and things like that, because we might write algorithms that a whole bunch of different steps can't be interrupted, temporarily invalid state or whatever.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.120
So we might have to think.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.360
But it's very rare, actually, that you end up doing locks and stuff.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:46.000
And other languages like C++ or C Sharp or something, it's common to do locking all over the place, right?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.440
For all kinds of funky things.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.240
So it's nice that it's not there.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:18:00.540
And there have been several attempts to take it out to switch to other types of memory management, other things that let us avoid it.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:10.580
But it's always had these problems of making the C extensions not working well or breaking them, of actually making the single threaded case slower.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:18.260
It's one thing to say, okay, we could switch to some other system that's not using the GIL, but now your code's 1.5 times slower.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.420
Unless you send like six cores on it, then now it's faster, sort of, sometimes.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.980
Like, that's not a great solution either, is it?

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.340
One of the key things that we protect with the GIL is ref counts.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:38.760
Because we use ref counting for our, essentially for memory management, then we have to keep those ref counts safe from race conditions.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:45.080
So we would have to do locking around all ref count operations, and that would get really expensive real fast.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:45.660
Right, exactly.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.920
There have been other projects in the past.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:54.800
Several people have tried to get rid of the GIL, including most recently Larry Hastings with the Gilectomy.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:04.780
And each time it comes down to having to add a lot of locks or similar mechanisms to protect those global resources.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:13.900
And those things kind of fall apart and cause performance issues that ultimately kind of kill the goals of the project.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.920
Right, or break the C APIs.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:23.960
If you're looking for performance and you're like, well, we made the Python bit 1.5 times faster, but the C parse doesn't work.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.660
Like, all of a sudden, it's much slower, right?

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.140
Like, that's a problem.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:37.680
If we were able to just break the C API, or even get rid of it and use something else, then we'd be able to solve this problem, I think, without a lot of trouble.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:44.700
But because people in C extensions rely on a lot of these details, we just can't get rid of them that easily.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:50.200
There has been recognition of this kind of in the core team in the last few years,

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.940
and a recognition that we really got to figure out how to solve this.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.420
So I'm hopeful that we're going to figure this out.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:04.700
There have been a lot of smart people thinking about this and a lot of good ideas over the last year or two.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.140
There are some things that will have to break, but I think we'll be able to sort it out.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:08.480
That's good.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:17.080
Let's talk about the proposal that you've been working on, PEP 554, which has this concept of a sub-interpreter.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:34.360
And when I heard about this, I thought, wow, okay, this is like some creation that's going to be like this new thing that allows for isolation so you can effectively mimic what you're doing with sub-processing or multi-processing,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.500
but without actually the overhead of processes and the inter-process communication.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.500
I'm like, okay, this is great.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:45.200
But then as I looked into it, this is not a new idea at the very core of it, right?

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:45.300
No.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.080
But it's just not something anybody's leveraged.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.700
Tell us about it.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.320
It's interesting.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320
It really is.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:58.200
Nick Coghlan kind of expressed it as the isolation of processes with the efficiency of threads.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.160
And it's not a pure explanation, but it's pretty close.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.720
Sub-interpreters have been around as part of Python.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:14.860
Originally, CPython was just implemented as kind of a blob of state, and there was an effort to kind of bring a little sanity to that

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:27.940
and isolate all of the state related to Python threads in one C struct and interpreters, which can have multiple threads, in another C struct.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.980
And then there's run type state still all over the place.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.440
That's just global.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:39.100
So at that point, that was, I don't know, 20, 21, 22 years ago, something like that.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:46.220
And at that time, C API was added for creating and destroying sub-interpreters.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:53.120
And the threading API is built around sub-interpreters to an extent.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.740
But it's funny because, like you said, it's not a new thing.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.900
And yet, a lot of core developers didn't even know about sub-interpreters.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.360
Very few users knew about it.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:12.280
I knew of only one project that was actually using sub-interpreters meaningfully up until four or five years ago.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.660
And that was Mod Whiskey, Graham Dumbledon.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:22.360
And it's funny because sub-interpreters now, there's more awareness and people are starting to use them more, and some big projects including.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:32.400
And at the same time, a lot of old users, so Graham, and I've since heard from a few people that use sub-interpreters internally for a long time.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.760
Now that we're fixing all the problems with them, they're actually moving off of sub-interpreters because they gave up.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.580
It's like, no, just wait another year.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.700
We'll probably have a lot of this stuff.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.240
Yeah.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.440
And you can benefit from performance improvements that we're doing.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.960
So it's really funny.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.480
A lot of people just didn't know about it.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.580
And the people who did didn't really think about it all that much.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:23:01.020
But it's funny, as C-Python progressed, things would get added in, and they would affect sub-interpreters, but nobody would realize it.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.720
There wasn't good tests of sub-interpreters.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.560
There weren't many users, so nobody would report problems.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:11.360
Poor Graham, he'd report things, and nobody would really pick up the bugs and work on them.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.640
Well, this guy's crazy.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.260
What's he talking about, this weird sub-interpreter?

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:14.600
Yeah.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.900
Is that even a thing?

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.440
Exactly.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.940
There are a number of problems.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:25.440
In my opinion, it never really was quite finished, because they're not as isolated as they probably should be.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.360
And there are a number of other rough corners, bugs, and stuff.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:37.480
So what's interesting is the stuff I'm doing, one consequence is that those things have to get fixed.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:37.800
Yeah.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:51.720
So the idea is to lift this concept of a sub-interpreter up out of the C layer, create a standard library module called interpreters, that allows you to program against this concept of the sub-interpreter.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.020
Correct.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.180
So it's definitely, I'm doing this with isolation in mind.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:04.840
You know, at first, the proposal was just wrap the C-API in Python in a C extension and call it good.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.140
Because it's there, right?

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:14.580
And somebody early, early on pointed out, well, if you can't share stuff between sub-interpreters, all you can do is just start one up.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.260
It's not really nearly as useful.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:24.140
In C, you just do the C thing, you know, pass stuff around however you want and shoot yourself in the foot if you want.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.100
Here's a bunch of pointers.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:25.580
Uh-huh.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:26.720
You can talk to them all you want.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.020
Exactly.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.660
Make sure you don't talk to them at the same time.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.900
Don't hurt yourself.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.600
Yeah, exactly.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.740
But in Python, you know, we don't have the opportunity, which is, I think, a good thing here.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:43.380
So they're like, yeah, well, it's not nearly as useful as it would be if you had just at least some basic way of sharing data between them.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.260
So I was like, oh, yeah, that's a good point.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:25:03.380
And so really got me thinking about sub-interpreters more than just as a tool to achieve other goals, which I expect we'll talk about, but also as actually a vehicle to a concurrency model that I think fits the human brain better, at least in my opinion.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.080
I'm not a big fan of async.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.020
I'm sure it's great.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.080
Some people really get it.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.060
For me, it's just, it's, I don't like it.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:12.240
Yeah.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.120
But, you know, that's fine.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.240
I think there are other ways of thinking about concurrency that work a lot better.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.020
Things have been studied since the 60s.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:20.340
Right.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:30.340
Message passing and some of these types of concepts where you're more explicitly like, I'm going to send this over to the thread and the thread's going to pick it up and work on it or things like this, right?

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:30.860
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:37.380
Before I moved to Microsoft, I was at Canonical for three years working on various projects written in Go.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:53.980
And Go has a concurrency model that's, I would say, loosely based on CSP, which is kind of a concurrency model that was researched and developed since the 60s, especially by a guy named Tony Hoare from over in the UK.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.940
Really powerful stuff.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.560
And, you know, it has a lot of similar roots with like the actor model.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.120
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:06.540
Go is one of these languages that very explicitly controls how concurrency works.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:11.260
And it's part of the language that this data sharing and whatnot happens, right?

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:21.880
I don't think it's great what they did because they took CSP and then they broke some of the fundamental ideas behind it, like isolation in these processes, right?

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.700
I mean, CSP is communicating sequential processes.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:31.320
So the idea is that you have a process that is just, it's like a single threaded program, right?

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:37.260
You could break it down into just a linear flow of code, no matter what, deterministically.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:42.380
And then you have a mechanism by which these processes can communicate.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.520
Basically, just send messages back and forth.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.340
And they block at those points.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.900
I'm going to send a message and wait for the other process to pick it up.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.820
And then at that point, both processes will move on.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:27:06.440
So I spent a while trying to figure out really what would be the best way to set up rudimentary communication between subinterpreters.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:19.120
And my experience with Go came about, so I don't know if I just said this, but Go routines, which are kind of the idea of these processes in Go, they're not isolated.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.960
So you can share data between them.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.940
So basically invalidates a lot of the ideas behind CSP.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.420
I mean, it's interesting.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.640
So I want to take advantage of the isolation between subinterpreters.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:38.520
And so essentially, you end up with kind of opt-in data sharing or opt-in concurrency.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.760
You don't have to worry about races and stuff like that.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:46.040
It's very much kind of like what the multiprocessing communication flow is, right?

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:52.600
I'm giving this data over to this other process, and then they can just have it and they own it and don't have to worry about it.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.580
Or they get a copy of it or something like that.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.420
So I looked for a lot of prior art that kind of followed this model.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.120
And the stuff in multiprocessing was one.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:05.140
The queue module has a lot of stuff that's kind of a similar idea.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.640
And there are a few other things out there.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:15.260
And of course, in other languages, I really stuck with this idea of following the model of CSP as much as I could.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:23.960
And really, while the proposal isn't like some CSP implementation, the whole thing is kind of with CSP in mind.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.600
Okay, could I build like a nice CSP library on top of this?

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:28.860
Right.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:36.120
Because like you said, without the communication, like you said, it's like, it's kind of interesting, but it's just like a task spawning type of thing.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.300
Right.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.700
Like it's not really any sort of cooperation.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.180
This portion of Talk Python to me is brought to you by TopTal.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.260
Are you looking to hire a developer to work on your latest project?

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.860
Do you need some help rounding out that app you just can't seem to get finished?

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.840
Maybe you're even looking to do a little consulting work yourself.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.620
You should give TopTal a try.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.660
Maybe you've heard we launched some mobile apps for our courses over on iOS and Android.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:05.020
I use TopTal to hire a solid developer at a fair rate to help create those mobile apps.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.820
It was a great experience and I can totally recommend working with them.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:12.220
I met with a specialist who helped figure out my goals and technical skills required.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.880
Then they did all the work to find the right person.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.120
I had a short interview with two folks and hired the second one.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.560
Then we released the apps just two months later.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:36.920
I think what we ended up with, which is channels, really basic, but I wanted to keep the PEP as

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.860
minimal as possible.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.680
And I think it really, I came up with a good solution for this.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:47.380
So one of the tricks though, is that because of the isolation, you can't just share objects

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.520
between sub interpreters.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.500
I mean, currently you can at the C layer.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:56.440
But in the Python, I didn't want to give anybody ever the opportunity to share objects, at least

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.080
not at first.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.380
Maybe we can come up with some clever solutions for that.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.840
But currently you can't.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:06.680
So, I mean, there's really a limit to what can be shared between sub interpreters as proposed.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.620
And I want to keep it as minimal as possible so we can build from there.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.200
Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.420
Well, one of the really exciting parts of that is one thing that is not shared between sub

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.600
interpreters is the global interpreter lock, right?

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.460
Well, currently it is.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.300
That's the problem.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.120
So right now, sub interpreters do share the gil.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:30.280
So one of the things I'm working on is kind of the bigger problem.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:36.240
And really, I'm trying to tackle this problem of supporting multi-core parallelism in CPython

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.880
using sub interpreters.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:45.120
So kind of PEP 554 is just a vehicle to make sub interpreters accessible to Python users.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:53.860
But really, the actual goal is to fix sub interpreters, including to stop sharing the gil between sub interpreters, which is kind of crazy.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.680
That is crazy.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.780
But at that point, then you can say start five threads.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.340
Each thread starts a sub interpreter as its startup process.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.320
And then all of a sudden, the gil is no longer a problem.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:05.840
Precisely.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.120
Potentially.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.260
And because you're not sharing the objects, right?

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.160
You don't have to worry about that.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.380
And now you have these channels where you can pass data back and forth in a thread-safe way.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.180
That's super cool.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.120
It sounds like sub interpreters as they exist don't do that.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.780
But that's kind of the ultimate goal.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:21.020
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.620
Create this exposure of the API to actually create sub interpreters.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:28.500
Move the gil down so it's one per sub interpreter.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.480
And then a way to communicate between them.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.020
So that's the Harrier problem, right?

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.000
Is the gil.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:39.220
What we have is, like I said earlier, we have a whole bunch of runtime state all over the place.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.200
So one of the things I did a couple of years ago for this project, there are a bunch of things that we've done.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.400
Big things that probably nobody even notices because they're all internal.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:55.240
But one of the things I did was I took all the global state I could find and I pulled it all into one single C struct.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.820
So what's neat about this project, the ultimate goal of not sharing the gil between sub interpreters

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:04.980
is that it requires just a ton of other things.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:13.080
I think I list out 80 different tasks that are probably not even super fine grained that have to get done in order to make this work.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:22.460
And probably 70, 75 of those are things that are a good idea regardless of the outcome of my ultimate goal.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.000
Right?

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.340
Right.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.880
See, Python is going to be cleaner.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.420
Uh-huh.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.800
If we get to those 75 things and then we're like, oh, it's not going to work.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.520
Well, that's okay because, dang, you know, we got some good stuff done anyway.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.200
Stuff that we wouldn't have done because we weren't really that motivated.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.700
I mean, this is open source.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.680
So I have a motivation and other people share some of the motivations.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.500
It's really neat.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:50.420
There's a lot of collaboration going on now because not just for the whole sub interpreter thing.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:55.320
Some of the stuff that I need is stuff that other people need for different reasons.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.580
And it's working out pretty well.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:02.620
But the whole thing is I took all this state and smashed it into a single struct.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:08.540
And as kind of a side effect, I just want to make sure I didn't hurt performance by doing that.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:16.020
So I ran Python's performance suite and it turned out that I was getting a 5% improvement in performance.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:16.460
Interesting.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.020
Do you know why?

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:17.400
It's crazy.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.900
Well, I expect it's because of cache locality of that struct.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.680
That was my first guess as well, right?

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:29.340
As you load one element of that struct, everything drags along onto L2 cache or the local cache.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.480
And it's just a little quicker, right?

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.100
You just accidentally do fewer deep memory lookups.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:41.740
Somebody pointed out to me that it probably doesn't have quite the same effect on performance for a PGO build.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:51.140
Where the compiler can optimize the layout of memory and various other things relative to what's hottest in the code, right?

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:51.980
Yeah.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:59.240
So it kind of runs the thing through a workload and determines what's the hottest chunks of memory and pushes those together.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.480
So you get those same cache locality benefits.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:06.080
So ultimately under a PGO build, probably not the same performance benefits.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.140
But I only bring that up because...

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.860
PGO performance guided optimization.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:11.140
Yes.

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:11.560
Thank you.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.280
For everyone out there.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:12.420
Yeah.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:12.960
Yeah.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.820
Acronyms.

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:14.340
Yeah.

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:14.540
Yeah.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.320
So maybe it's not as big necessarily.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.520
Is that theoretical or is that something that is actually done on CPython builds?

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.000
People do it.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.520
If the one that I brew install, is that one?

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:25.940
PGO?

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.380
I don't know.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.360
Optimize?

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:27.940
Okay.

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:28.980
Yeah.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:28.980
Yeah.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:29.000
Yeah.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.380
You get some real benefits from a PGO build.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.380
There are lots of these little things.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:42.940
One of the things I needed to happen was there was some work that Nick Coughlin started like four or five years ago to clean up runtime startup.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.800
And I needed that because otherwise there were certain things I just couldn't do.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.420
So I was blocked on that.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:35:02.360
So finally, I got around to taking the branch that he had, which is on subversion, and moving it over to Git and then at the same revision.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:09.320
And then I had to rebase it against master and fix all the conflicts and finally got that merge like two years ago.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.600
And that was a big thing.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:16.560
And then because of that, we're able to do a lot of really good things with startup that we weren't able to before.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.920
So that's a side effect.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.080
And there are all these things that are just good.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:27.140
That was one of the larger goals of Python 3 as well is try to like fix the just the cold startup times, right?

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.520
No.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:27.860
No.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:34.760
One of the goals that we have is to fix startup times so they're at least on par with Python 2, which they weren't.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.640
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.360
Weren't nearly at first.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:36.940
That's what I was thinking.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:37.740
Yeah.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.540
So we're mostly on par now.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.740
The biggest problem was all the codecs and Unicode stuff.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.300
That really hits startup performance.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:50.380
So if you think about subinterpreters, if you start up a new subinterpreter, it has to build all this state.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.900
It has to load all these modules.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.420
There's a ton of stuff that has to happen, right?

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.200
So you're going to incur that cost for each subinterpreter.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:02.020
As a consequence of what I'm working on, I want to make sure that startup time is as small as possible.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:19.420
So it's definitely one of the things, maybe not one of the immediate concerns, but kind of one of the relatively low-hanging fruit for this project once I finish this first phase is to go in and do things like make interpreter startup more efficient, whether it's sharing or whatever.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:24.180
And those are things that are a good idea regardless of use of subinterpreters.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.280
I mean, just for the main interpreter, getting startup faster is a good idea.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.560
And that's something that I want for subinterpreters.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.220
And I'm motivated to do it.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:37.760
And I think other people, once subinterpreters get in widespread use, people are going to be like, oh, yeah, this is great.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.320
And people are going to be motivated to fix some of these deficiencies in subinterpreters.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:42.940
Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.640
And it'll definitely, as it's a little bit of a catch-22, right?

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.260
You said it wasn't even hardly quite finished because here's this idea.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:55.000
But at the same time, if no one's really using it, why do you care about fixing this thing?

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.640
And if no one's fixing it, I'm not going to use it because it doesn't quite work.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.040
And then here you are in this lock, right?

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.940
So it reaches a point where, well, for me, it was in 2014.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.740
I was having a conversation with somebody at work.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.340
And they were saying, yeah, Python's going to die because it doesn't do multicore because of the gill.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:23.160
And it was just, I don't know, one of those moments, you know, when something hits you so deep, you know, they dig a little too hard.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.840
And you're like, okay, fine.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.500
Forget you.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.560
I'm going to fix this.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.560
And I'm never going to hear anybody complain about the GIL again.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:29.860
Yeah.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.980
Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.460
That's what this project is.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.580
That's what I've been working on for several years now.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:40.420
It's basically just to get people to stop complaining about the gill.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:46.340
I definitely think, you know, rightly or wrongly, it's one of the perceived deep limitations of Python.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:46.660
Yeah.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:55.440
I think wrongly, but I do think that it is perceived to be that like Python is not nearly, is barely appropriate for like parallel computing.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:55.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.100
I don't think that's right, but I think that's the perception.

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:58.380
Yeah.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.800
Outside of a lot of Python, or maybe within it.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.600
I think it's a fair perception for a class of users.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.280
And as a community, we like to be inclusive.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.540
We don't want to leave anybody out.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.540
We want to make sure that things work out for folks.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.420
It's just being open source.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:18.460
It's nothing's going to happen until somebody cares enough to do something about it.

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.620
And that happened for me.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.220
That's awesome.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:20.520
Yeah.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.840
And so here we are.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.040
Yeah.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:28.800
So it sounds like around September 2017, you introduced PEP 554 to address this.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.400
Probably you've been working prior to that.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:36.420
2018, you talked about it at PyCon US at the Language Summit and whatnot.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.140
And then also, again, in 2019.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.380
And like those, also, it sounds like those experiences were a little bit different.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:46.620
Do you want to maybe recount those for us and tell us how this is being perceived over time?

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.120
You bet.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.820
I mean, I've gotten support from the core team.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:59.700
I think my first post about all of this to the Python dev mailing list was probably 2016, early 2016, I think.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:04.340
And, you know, and there was a lot of discussion about it.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:18.080
And there were really only a handful of people that had any sort of opposition to it, any major concerns, which I took as kind of a valid litmus test on if it was worth pursuing.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:18.480
Yeah.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.600
And when you initially presented it, what was the scope?

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:27.080
Was the scope like the final end goal where there's like you're trying to use it for concurrency and all that?

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.400
That was like from the start.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:35.320
Talking about using subinterpreters and not sharing the GIL to achieve these goals of multi-core parallelism.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:43.000
So, you know, at some level to the details, pursuing kind of a CSP model, a standard library module.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.820
And, you know, and the response was pretty good.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:51.320
There was several long threads and I incorporate all the feedback into the PEP ultimately.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.120
But, yeah, the feedback from the PEP was great.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:40:06.240
And then come PyCon 2018, I basically asked everybody I talked to, explained subinterpreters and what I was working on and asked them what they thought of it, how they would use it.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.480
And it seemed like everybody had a different response.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.640
Everybody was excited about it, almost universally.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.320
And everybody had a different response on how they would use it.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.080
Most people, I didn't even have to ask them.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:23.120
The big guy, go like, wow, I have the perfect use case for that.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.400
This, this, this, this.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.320
And I even at one point asked, oh, his name escapes me, the maintainer of Dask.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.200
Matthew Rockland.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.420
Matthew Rockland.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:32.680
You're welcome.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.880
I asked him about this.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.180
He's like, wow, subinterpreters sound neat.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:50.180
But I doubt I would incorporate, I would make use of them for Dask, except Dask internally has all these control threads and all this machinery built out.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:54.140
For managing all of the distributed programming.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:59.900
Just so people know, Dask is a way to run your Python code potentially on a bunch of different systems.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:05.520
It's kind of like, like a Pandas data frame style programming.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.700
But you say run this computation, but like all over the place.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.440
That's the problem that Das solves.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:10.820
And then.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.660
So it's really interesting.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:16.720
He said, but yeah, I would totally use that for my internal stuff.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.580
I mean, for these control threads.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.460
I mean, I would totally make use of that because it was, it's perfect.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:27.960
Or, you know, talking to web folks and they're like a bunch of different use cases for how this apply to web frameworks.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.780
Or basically everybody had ideas.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:31.180
Yeah.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.580
There's a ton of great ways.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:32.820
Yeah.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:33.600
It was really neat.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.680
So I got excited and then come the sprints that year.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:44.480
Oh, and one of the people that was really supportive was Davin Potts, who's one of the maintainers of multiprocessing.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:49.560
Which is, you know, I thought that was a pretty good sign that I was in the right direction.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.820
It is absolutely a good sign.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:54.080
I mean, this is like the next gen multiprocessing in my mind, kind of.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.300
I still wonder if once we have sub interpreters, do we even need multiprocessing?

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.960
Subprocesses make sense.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.100
But does multiprocessing make sense?

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:02.800
I'm not sure.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:11.080
I mean, it's kind of like the big hammer to solve the GIL problem and this isolation problem by just going fine, the operating system will do it.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.800
But if CPython itself does it, then I mean, maybe there's a memory.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.540
But it's interesting to think about.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:16.720
Yeah.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.460
What's funny is now after I'm charged up, I'm excited.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.780
I've got all sorts of notes.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.680
I'm like, wow, you know, there's all this stuff.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.940
Several people have said that they'd like to help out.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:33.020
You know, and then I get to the sprints and you can imagine that Guido's a busy guy at PyCon.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.140
You know, everybody wants to talk to Guido, taking pictures.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.760
He can't get even a moment piece.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.620
I know it's, yeah, it's definitely got people chasing him around.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.680
It wears him out.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.540
And there's always stuff going on.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.780
There are people that he needs to talk to about different proposals and whatever.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.660
And this is 2018.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.700
He's still BDFL.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.100
And there's a lot going on.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.100
And what happens?

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:59.460
He actually comes and finds me, sits me down.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:05.540
And for 45 minutes, he basically tells me that he thinks it's a bad idea.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:10.920
And I can tell you, I walked to, so I understood where he's coming from.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.560
And I think in part, he had misunderstood what I was trying to do.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:14.880
Yeah.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.780
It's like that telephone game where one person tells a person who tells a person something and

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.080
it's not the same on the other side.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.900
And in the conversation, you know, I tried to clarify a few points, but it really wasn't

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:29.460
a great opportunity to try and explain really why this was a good idea.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:38.640
I mean, the PEP to an extent does, but I think there's kind of a gap in the justification that

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.220
really Guido was just, I hadn't communicated well to him.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.560
So 45 minutes.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:49.760
And basically, you know, I conceded some of the points that he made and tried to explain

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.440
the others.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.680
And ultimately, you know, it's not like he said, stop.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.980
He basically said he thought it was a waste of my time that I should work on something

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.320
that's going to benefit people more.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:08.460
Also, he was coming from thinking about the problem in a different way than I was and a

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:12.920
different understanding of exactly what I was trying to solve and what I was trying, what

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.620
the proposal was, what the solution was.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:19.160
Well, he probably also has a lot of Gil fatigue hearing how Gil is ruining Python and all that,

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:19.400
right?

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:19.740
Yeah.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:24.000
And I think in part, he was just worried that I was going to get people excited about something

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.440
that wasn't going to actually end up happening.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.160
Okay.

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.700
So it was kind of a bummer.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.220
I was bummed out probably the rest of the day.

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:35.840
Did you walk away less inspired or are you still excited after all the other input you

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.020
got?

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.340
I was still determined.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:37.760
Yeah.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:42.720
I probably, my excitement level was lower only because it'd been suppressed a little, but

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.120
you know, that wears off.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:49.360
And talking to more people about it, same level of excitement, the same excitement about how

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.260
they would use it.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:55.680
And so, you know, I didn't worry about it, but I was worried that if I couldn't convince

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.440
Guido, then A, of course, I didn't think it would happen.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.560
And B, maybe it really wasn't a good idea.

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.160
Because Guido is smart and he's been doing this a long time.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:10.320
And I have absolute trust in that uncanny ability he has to understand whether something

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.220
is good for Python or not.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:12.460
Yeah.

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:13.740
I mean, he's amazing.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:17.780
So it did make me wonder, well, what if he's right?

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.340
Maybe I'm not understanding.

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.580
That's probably more likely.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.200
So, but I kept at it.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:22.920
I was determined.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:28.360
You know, like I said, I waited three years for the job I have now.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.160
So I was like, you know, I'll just keep going.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:37.460
And if nothing else comes of it, I was convinced that 80 or 90% of stuff that I was doing was

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:38.520
a good idea regardless.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.540
So I was like, I'll just keep going.

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:45.280
And if it ends up that it's not going to work out, I won't feel too bad about it.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.200
I'll have made a difference, I think.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.780
So kept going.

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:55.020
But then 2019 rolls around and Guido pulls me aside again and says, oh yeah, that's

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:55.580
a good idea.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.220
Been thinking about it.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:58.100
Because he got it.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:02.840
Well, the point that we were fixing, he saw over the course of the year, he saw that I was

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:08.480
working on all these things that I needed for the goal, but they were a good idea regardless.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.080
And he's like, oh yeah, you're working on all this stuff.

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:18.420
And also, he probably heard my explanation a few more times and it clicked on how I was trying

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.300
to solve this problem.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.000
And he said, yeah, that could work.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.540
And so I was floating around for a while.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:24.440
It was exciting.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.260
That's super cool.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:32.800
One of the challenges a lot of peps and projects have had recently, let's say since July 2018,

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:41.720
maybe, is we, more like you guys, have not really had a way to decide to make decisions

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:47.460
after Guido said, I'm stepping down, I'm just stepping back to standard core developer or

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:51.720
steering council now, but stepping back saying, you guys have to figure out a new way to like

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.220
make decisions and sort of govern yourself.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:54.560
Right?

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.540
So that, your PEP spanned that gap.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.440
So I'm sure that didn't.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.480
Oh man, it was brutal.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:46:59.960
Was it?

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:06.600
It literally killed a lot of the momentum I had coming out of PyCon 2018 because that happened

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.720
just a couple months after.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:14.920
And basically, I kept working on stuff, but there was all these discussions about governance

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.140
and governance and governance, and it just dominated a lot of what we were working on.

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:22.360
So there wasn't a lot of collaboration going on with this project.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:28.920
And there was a lot of just cognitive effort to stay on top of this stuff because it's important.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:35.520
So really, until all this was solved, pep554 was ready.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:43.240
Basically, right after PyCon, I was 2018, I'd worked up kind of a separate list of arguments

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:48.080
to make to Guido on why this was a good idea and try and kind of fill that gap that I had

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:48.580
perceived.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:54.780
And then on top of that, I had updated the PEP to kind of iron out some of the small things.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:55.860
I felt like it was ready.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:48:02.680
And literally, right before I was going to ask for pronouncement on the pep, then, or no,

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.660
I think I was going to wait until the core sprints in September so that I could talk to

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.880
Guido in person and try and make the case and then ask for pronouncement.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:15.740
So, you know, this was, it was brutal because then no peps got decided.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:21.560
And the core sprint was mostly spent talking about governance stuff, which that's fine.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.980
It was productive, but I wasn't able to get a lot of progress.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.480
So it just kind of slowed things down so much.

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:32.140
And then when we finally got governance ironed out, you know, there's transition.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:39.040
So this whole time I was honestly aiming to solve it, to get PEP 554 landed for three, eight,

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:44.660
and then even get the, the stop sharing the GIL stuff done for three, eight.

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.660
Neither one happened in large part because of the whole governance issue.

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:52.780
It's probably good in the longterm that this transition happened, but in the short term,

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.640
it definitely threw a bunch of molasses in, you know,

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.020
it's a little disappointed every release you miss on something.

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:01.460
It's a little part of you hurts, but.

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.380
I can imagine.

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.800
Well, and the releases are long, like the gaps are wide between them, right?

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.140
18 months is a long time in technology.

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.280
It's not like, well, maybe next month it'll come out.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:16.140
We're actually talking about reducing the release cycle to a lot smaller, six or 12 months.

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.260
Depending.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:18.360
I think that's interesting.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.000
What's the trade-off there?

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.520
So our currently released manager, Rukash, he, he said for three, nine, I want it to be shorter.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:30.860
So he basically said there are a variety of reasons.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:38.780
The main opposition to having shorter release cycles was that it's more of a burden on the release team,

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.680
but that's less of an issue.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.900
Now there's a lot more automation.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:45.460
And so this is coming from the release manager.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:49.280
So he was in a position to determine what made sense.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.620
So that's, that's kind of how that's played out.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.160
He's, he's like, let's do this.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.900
And so there was some discussion for a stretch on what would be the best time.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:01.820
And if it made sense at all, of course, but if we went with it, you know,

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:10.100
what kind of release interval we'd have and how that would work logistically and how that would play into other factors of core development.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.660
So I, I don't remember where that's gotten to.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:24.760
I think there was some consensus that it would make sense to look at it further, but I think like most long discussions do, it kind of tailed off without a good conclusion quite yet.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.760
I don't know.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.380
I don't remember.

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.480
It's, I don't remember what the PEP number is.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.140
It's the, the release PEP for three, nine is where he started this discussion.

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.500
So there's a number of threads related to that PEP.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.000
You know, to me, it sounds generally positive, right?

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:48.940
Like smaller releases that you can understand a little bit more completely rather than just like, here's a huge dump of 18 months of work.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.700
But I definitely do understand it.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:57.660
I mean, you've got all the places, all the Linux distributions, all the other places that are shipping it.

00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.840
They have to now think probably about that more frequently.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.840
That was definitely one of the concerns.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:11.620
But now that the Linux distributions are moving away from exposing their system Python, that it's less of a concern.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:12.020
Right.

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:19.200
So one interesting thing in this discussion was just the idea of moving to Calver for versioning Python.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.180
I think that was something that Brett had talked about.

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:24.920
So, you know, there are a number of different ideas.

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:32.340
Like actually having the version number be like 2019.6 for June or something like that.

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:32.500
Yeah.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:38.440
So then you'd end up with 2019.6.0.1, you know, for bug fixes and all that.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:38.780
Definitely.

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:42.340
I like the calendar versioning for like packages and stuff.

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.280
But for the actual core, like that's pretty interesting.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:45.880
I don't know.

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.480
It may not make sense.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.200
There are a lot of things that people talked about.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:55.220
We talked about the possibility of LTS releases or some variation on that.

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:57.700
And so that we'd be maintaining multiple.

00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:04.820
But, you know, I think a lot of people are kind of burnt out on having maintained 2.7 and Python 3.

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.800
At this point, like, have we just about gotten out of this?

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:12.340
Most people don't bother with 2.7 at this point, core developers.

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.440
So it's really interesting.

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.200
I don't know.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.440
There are lots of ideas.

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.480
I think ultimately we'll settle on the right thing.

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.300
Something that'll work well for us.

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:24.660
Even if it's a status quo, if we figure out that's the best way forward.

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:32.480
But we've already since 3.6, I think it was, we started doing a shorter release cycle, more like 14 months.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:37.100
Because we used to do release cycle from release to release.

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:40.300
But now we do, or from final to final.

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:44.300
Now we do, if you think about it, it's more like final to beta 1.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:44.580
Right.

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:47.720
Which we're already like way past 3.8 beta 1.

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:54.960
The final release date for the next version is basically 18 months from beta 1 now instead of final.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.700
That's the way we've been doing the last few releases.

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.260
So it breaks it, shortens it to like 14 months.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.800
So 12 months really wouldn't be that different.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.700
Yeah, that's true.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.200
We'll see what happens there.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.700
But, you know, interesting topic.

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:07.080
For sure.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:14.720
So the final takeaway is you're targeting Python 3.9, which will be basically where the work is going into now, right?

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.220
Like you're already in beta of 3.8.

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.800
It's kind of frozen and whatnot.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.920
So it's going to be probably the next version of Python.

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.100
Maybe that will be shorter.

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:22.640
Maybe not.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.300
A little undetermined at this point.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:27.440
Might be 12 months from now or who knows.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:33.660
I expect, regardless of when it is, that we're close enough that we'll be able to get all of this sub-interpreter stuff done for that.

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:37.380
Assuming PEP55R gets accepted, which I expect.

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.180
I hope it does.

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.220
I expect it will.

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:41.020
I don't see a reason why it wouldn't.

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:43.980
Yeah, it seems like the excitement is there for it.

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:53.740
To me, it clearly solves the problem, assuming like the startup time of the sub-interpreters is not just equal to multiprocessing and things like that.

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:56.040
It seems like it's going to be really great.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:00.560
Yeah, and what's nice is I've done this in a way that will start really minimal.

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:08.280
Like you'll only be able to pass bytes or strings or other basic immutable types between sub-interpreters.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:16.380
But with this foundation, then there's like a whole list of really neat projects that people can work on to improve things for sub-interpreters.

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:25.980
Like I talked about earlier, improving startup time, but also things like one neat idea is the idea of for memory allocators in CPython.

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:30.040
Right now, we use one memory allocator throughout the whole lifetime of the runtime.

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:34.460
Memory allocator is in charge of, of course, allocating and deallocating memory.

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:39.140
So what if you could use a different memory allocator per interpreter?

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:47.140
Well, what if you could at any arbitrary time swap out an allocator so that objects are allocated using different allocators?

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:54.300
Then you could manage relative to the allocators for those objects and you get some neat things.

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.460
Like what if you had an allocator that was page size, right?

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:10.360
And so then you actually can, in Python, have a class that kind of wraps that allocator so that you can create objects relative to that class.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:20.280
Or create an object that represents allocator and then any attribute that you create on the object is in that allocator or whatever.

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:27.340
So now you have this self-contained memory page that then you could mark, let's say, read-only.

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:33.060
Suddenly, all that memory is read-only and you have truly read-only objects in Python.

00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:46.660
What if you take that read-only and now you can pass that whole memory page over to another interpreter and you don't have to worry about any race conditions relative to that memory page?

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.620
One of the best ways to get parallelism is to have immutability.

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.280
I think there are lots of...

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.960
And so there's a...

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:59.460
I have a project open for this and a number of other resources where I've basically written all this stuff down.

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:05.220
Like, here's a whole list of awesome things that we can do once we have this foundation set.

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:09.440
Would you get things like maybe less memory fragmentation for long-running processes?

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.200
If you could start up these sub-interpreters, like give them a block of memory, let them throw that away.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:19.880
And like things like this, like other benefits, possible memory leaks for like badly written code, but like it was all within a sub-interpreter.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.940
There are a number of things there.

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:26.000
One is that I have a list of...

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.040
Like I said, there's all this global state all over.

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.680
This is kind of the main blocker for me right now.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:36.640
And so we have all these static globals in the C code all over the place, thousands of them.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.280
Most of them can't be global.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:44.360
So I can't even pull them into the runtime state struct.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:54.440
I have to pull them down into the interpreter state, which means I have to collect them out of static globals and kind of migrate them into this pi interpreter state struct.

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.260
And it's just a lot of work.

00:56:56.260 --> 00:57:01.440
And then I have to make sure that nobody adds any static globals that they shouldn't in the future.

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:04.060
Or else, same problem all over again.

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:08.040
So, I mean, this is probably the main problem right now.

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:19.320
Aside from all those globals, there are some parts of the pi runtime state, which is this struct where I pulled in a lot of globals earlier, a couple years ago.

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:28.040
There are key items of that struct that I've identified that need to move over into the interpreter state.

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.180
The gil will be the last one of those.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:33.280
But right before that is memory allocators.

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.100
So I'm pretty sure that we'll be able to do this just fine.

00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:40.500
But I need to see how it affects performance.

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:45.000
But moving the memory allocators to per interpreter.

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:53.980
So I think one of the side effects, I mean, it really could be reducing memory fragmentation down, you know, isolating it to per interpreter.

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:56.960
Which, if you're using multiple interpreters, that's a good thing.

00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.940
Yeah, it's really interesting.

00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:05.600
And certainly the pressure that hardware is putting on top of programming languages and runtimes is not getting less, right?

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.420
Like, we're only going to have more cores, not fewer going forward.

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:17.760
So it's only going to be a problem that stands out more starkly if Python only reasonable runs on like one core at a time.

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:22.740
When you have 16, 32, 64 cores, whatever it is in like five years, right?

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:23.060
Yep.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.620
So it's definitely a good project.

00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:30.040
I'm really excited about it still after first motivated to work on this and five years ago.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.980
You know, I'm still motivated.

00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:33.540
Almost gave up at one point.

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:35.100
But plugging away.

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:36.680
And now a lot of people are excited.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.940
Looks like it's really going to happen for 3.9.

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:40.760
Are some of the other core developers helping you?

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.340
Somewhat.

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:45.260
Everybody's got different goals in mind.

00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:50.620
Victor Stinners, he's been really helpful for some of this stuff, especially relative to the CPI.

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:54.400
I've had offers of help from others.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:59:00.800
Before Emily Morehouse became a committer, I was helping to mentor her.

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:03.920
And one of the things that we did, we met basically weekly.

00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:09.540
And for the most part, we paired up on working on sub-interpreters.

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.820
And that was a big help.

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:11.500
Now she's...

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:11.980
Yeah, that's cool.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.180
She's all important now.

00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:15.020
No, no.

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:15.920
Emily's great.

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.360
But she's so busy.

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:18.000
Yeah, she's great.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.400
She's running a successful company.

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:20.780
It's really busy.

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:27.440
And on top of that, she's the chair for PyCon 2020 and 2021.

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.420
Well, I'm guessing 2021.

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:31.160
Anyway, at least next year.

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.200
And then she's got a lot of this stuff going on.

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.140
And she did the assignment expression implementation.

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.060
And all sorts of stuff.

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:42.480
But during that time when she was helping out with this stuff, it was a really big help.

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.660
So lots of help.

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:48.040
I had help from a number of folks out in enterprise.

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:53.700
Talked to folks at Facebook and Instagram and some other companies.

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:56.960
I've had offers to help from other individuals.

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.920
Help from small companies.

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:04.000
People coming up and saying, hey, I want to get my whole team working on this.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.360
It hasn't really gone anywhere.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.580
I don't get my hopes up too high.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.320
Yeah, it's such a big problem, right?

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.840
It's like so wide spanning.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.280
It sounds like with all the globals and whatnot.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.420
You got to really...

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.120
It's not very focused.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.740
So it's hard to work on, I suspect.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:20.940
One thing I made sure to do was break this problem down into zillion tasks.

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:22.760
As granular as I could.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.940
So I think I gave you the link there to the multi-core Python project that I have.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:31.080
If you look me up on GitHub, you'll find that repo.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:40.320
And that repo is basically just a wiki and GitHub projects breaking down all this work into discrete chunks.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.280
I'll certainly link to all those things in the show notes.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.700
So we'll just click on it.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.540
But yeah, that's great.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.600
Link to your...

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.520
You gave a talk at PyCon 2019.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.040
I don't think we mentioned that yet.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.320
Yeah.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.560
So it was a talk.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.160
I actually proposed two talks.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:01:02.140
One of them was specifically about subinterpreters and both PEPF5-4 and the whole effort to move GIL to per interpreter.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.720
That got rejected.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.840
That was the one I wanted to give.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.200
I gave another one that's broader.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.360
It was kind of a superset.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:16.300
It included the stuff from the other talk, but it also talked about all about the GIL in general.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:27.600
The history of the GIL, what really, you know, the technical ideas behind the GIL, really race conditions and parallelism, concurrency and all that stuff.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:46.480
And then also talked about what we need to do to kind of solve that problem, including talked about some of the past efforts and also current efforts to make fixes in the CPI, changes in CPI so that we can move past the GIL.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.100
And then I focus a lot of the talk on the stuff with subinterpreters.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:51.400
Cool.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.600
Yeah, that sounds really interesting.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.540
We'll definitely link to that.

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.120
All right, Eric, I think we're just about out of time.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.400
We'll definitely cover this.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.380
And I'm really excited for this project.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:10.620
So if you need any more positive vibes and feedback, I think this definitely has a chance to, like, really unlock this multi-core stuff in a general way.

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:17.040
I think there's interesting APIs you can put on top of it to even make it, like, almost transparent to folks.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:24.620
You know, I'm a big fan of the unsync library, which has a cool unifying view on top of threading, multiprocessing, and async.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:29.400
And this would dovetail, like, right into that, like, just a little decorative value.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:29.700
Oh, yeah.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.620
And boom, it's subinterpreter execution and all sorts of stuff.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.160
That would be great.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.520
Yeah, it's really awesome.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.240
Excellent work.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.480
I'm looking forward to using it in 3.9 beta 1.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.980
Now, before you get out of here, though, I do have two final questions for you.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.340
I think we may have spoiled the first response.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.680
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor are you going to use?

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.600
I think people may be able to guess what you're going to say here.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.420
You know, it's funny.

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:59.000
First, I'll say that the Python extension for VS Code is written not in Python, but in TypeScript.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.120
Because it's an Electron JS app, yeah.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.420
That's a whole other topic.

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.840
An interesting one.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.140
So, for the most part, I've been using Vim forever.

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:13.040
As long as I've used an editor that wasn't on Windows, I've been using Vim.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:23.660
And so, you know, naturally, after years, you kind of build up muscle memory, and you build up a whole set of configurations and all that stuff.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.700
And so, changing editors is hard.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:34.540
But given that I work on an extension for VS Code, it's pretty meaningful to actually use VS Code, right?

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:34.880
Right.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.680
Just to experience the thing, right?

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.000
It just makes it all that better.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.480
I really appreciate VS Code.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:43.820
I'm not really a big use my mouse while I'm working sort of guy.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:49.160
So, VS Code is definitely out of the box oriented towards use your mouse.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.680
I mean, Windows is.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.480
So, kind of there's that mentality.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.120
And that's fine.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.680
It's definitely, that's a target.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.320
So, it's not really how I operate all that much.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:06.420
There are ways, however, there's like a Vim extension, which basically makes VS Code work like Vim.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.520
So, I tried it.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.240
And it was nice.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.340
There were only a couple problems.

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.320
And they're kind of blockers for me.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:13.640
Okay.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:18.960
I use VS Code for Python stuff sometimes, but most of the time not.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.080
Once you know and love an editor, it's tough.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.080
I think that they're solvable problems.

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.220
And I've kind of pushed the feedback upstream.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.540
So, who knows?

01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:29.440
I mean, maybe I'll move away from Vim at some point.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.600
Makes it hard when I'm in a terminal and I need to edit stuff.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.440
I can't really pop up VS Code.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.340
But you do have that cool of like remote editing stuff that's coming in VS Code, which is pretty cool.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.560
That was one of the blockers.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.900
And now that there's that, it's less of an issue for me.

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:49.560
So, there are only really a couple things left that are kind of blocking me from using VS Code.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.920
Otherwise, I like it.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:57.140
There are a lot of things that I just don't, haven't bothered with them, but you just get out of the box with VS Code.

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:57.980
And it's nice.

01:04:57.980 --> 01:04:58.260
Cool.

01:04:58.740 --> 01:04:59.040
All right.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.380
And then notable PyPI package.

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:06.620
Maybe not the most popular, but something you're like, wow, people should really know about this and maybe they haven't heard of it.

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:07.600
That's a great question.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.240
There's a few out there.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:14.200
I'm a big fan of projects that really have been able to stay on top of their growth.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.260
That's a really hard problem when you're working on a project and it gets popular.

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.580
Trying to keep up.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.300
Most of the time it's just volunteers, spare time.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.260
Things often grow pretty organically.

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:28.060
I think for the most part, most programmers are pretty pragmatic.

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:30.820
So, they aim for immediate fixes.

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:36.140
So, it's really hard over time to keep a project under control, especially when it gets big.

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:41.760
So, I'm a big fan of projects that kind of keep that under control.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:47.720
There's some projects I think that have aimed for simplicity and really focused on that.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:52.980
See, I'm setting myself up for failure here though, because I want to give a good example of this.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:06:00.440
And not having looked at any projects too closely in a while, I may be kind of invalidating my whole point.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.620
There's some neat ones out there that people find useful.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:11.100
Of course, adders, but adders is kind of, with data classes now, adders is, it still has a place, I suppose, but not quite as much as it did.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.420
Yeah, it definitely seemed to have.

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.620
Did it directly inspire data classes?

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:15.040
Yeah.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.760
It's kind of achieved its goal like in a meta way.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.320
Anyway, yeah.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.560
I have one on there, ImportLib2, which is a backport of Python 3's ImportLib to Python 2.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:29.560
But I haven't really kept up with it, so it probably doesn't work anymore.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.060
Those are good.

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.920
Yeah, adders is definitely a good one.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.620
Backport ones are kind of useful sometimes.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:41.740
But there's also, there's some that make it easier to use some of the trickier functionality of Python.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.720
So, things that deal with descriptors, for instance.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.500
There's some decorator packages out there.

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:49.480
I think Graham Dumbledore has wrapped.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.840
That's an interesting one.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:07:03.820
One that I think people don't think about a whole lot is PSUtil, which actually is really neat because it has some good abstractions cross-platform for a lot of the things that you do system-side.

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:10.520
Like monitoring processes, getting system information, killing processes, or whatever.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.040
But it also stays pretty focused.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.040
I think that's a good one.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.840
Yeah, PSUtil, that's definitely a good one, yeah.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:19.060
PyC parser is one I've looked at recently that does some neat things.

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.880
It allows you to parse C code.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.900
Pure Python, though.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:22.600
Oh, interesting.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.100
Okay.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:27.780
There's some limitations to it, but otherwise, I think it's actually pretty cool.

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:28.100
Awesome.

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:28.860
Very cool.

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:30.020
Those are definitely some good ones.

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:30.400
All right.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.300
Final call to action.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:32.700
People are excited about this.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.920
Maybe they want to help out.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:36.540
Maybe they want to try or see some of the changes.

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.520
Is there something they can do?

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.360
Is there like this list you talked about?

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.840
Can they find this list to see if they can take one of them for you?

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.860
First of all, if anybody's interested, they can just get in touch with me immediately.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.820
I'll get right back to you.

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:55.000
We'll talk about all about the project, how they can help, what their interests are, how that lines up.

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.000
That project I talked about.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:05.200
That project I talked about, the link that you'll have, has a lot of the tasks broken down as issues organized on the project board.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.520
So you can take a look at those.

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:12.960
Also, the wiki is basically where I've dumped pretty much all of my notes on this stuff.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:13.960
Read through there.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.080
There's lots of stuff.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.380
You can see how it applies.

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:19.020
Give feedback on the pep.

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:27.360
And there may be other ways that it could work that you've thought of that nobody else did that are worth talking about.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.200
But again, just get in touch with me.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.620
It wouldn't take a lot of effort.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:38.760
And I can get you working on something right away, something that will interest you and will make a real difference here.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:45.080
I think this is a feature that people, until they think about it, don't realize how important it is.

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.660
I really do think that it's going to make a big difference for people.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:48.220
That's awesome.

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:49.900
Great bunch of ways for people to get involved.

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:50.940
I totally agree with you.

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:55.120
I've certainly put this in my top five most important projects for Python.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.260
So very good work.

01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.120
I love this deep dive.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.580
Thanks for taking the time, Eric.

01:08:58.580 --> 01:08:59.560
Yeah, thank you.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.340
Thanks for having me, Michael.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.120
Yeah, you bet.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:01.340
Bye.

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:05.320

I really appreciate it.

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:17.120
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:37.640
I'll see you next time.
