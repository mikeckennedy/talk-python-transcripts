00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:06.540
As developers and technologists, it's easy to think that powerful and unique ideas will percolate to the top.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.100
If we build something amazing, enthusiastic users will find and share our creations.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.900
Sometimes this happens, but more often, success is an iceberg on so many levels.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.440
We're going to look at one of those icebergs on this episode.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.460
Join me and Christian Medina as we discuss SEO, search engine optimization, for developers.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.720
Some of your search rankings are out of your control.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.440
But as you'll see, there are many tools in the developer's toolbox that directly affect your search rank.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.640
Let's dive in.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.760
This is Talk Python To Me, episode 263, recorded April 23rd, 2020.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:58.100
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.160

Chris, welcome back to Talk Python To Me.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.500
Hi, Mike.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.240
How's it going?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.280
Glad to be here.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.140
Yeah, it's going really well.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.380
You and I, we were supposed to be catching up at PyCon, and we're not, actually.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.040
That's right.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.820
That's right.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.840
We had some interesting plans for PyCon this year, and we were unable to do that.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.540
But oh well.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.260
We roll with the punches and move on, I guess, right?

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.820
Yeah, what a bummer.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.660
I'm a little bit bummed that PyCon's not happening this year, but at the same time, you know,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.440
it's first world problems, right?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.980
Like, everything could be way worse than we don't get to go to our geek hall here.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.940
But at the same time, I really was looking forward to it, and yeah, we had some cool stuff

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.900
for the expo floor we were going to do together, but not to be.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.060
Maybe 2021.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.600
That's right.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.100
I tweeted a little picture of all the badges and stuff.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.560
I know.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.040
I was going to bring online, but okay.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.780
Yeah, I have a big box of stickers that we'll now have to wait until the next event.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.860
So welcome back.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.480
Welcome back.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.100
You've been on the show a couple of times.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.140
You first came on the show with episode 166 for continuous delivery with Python.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.840
And that was really interesting to talk about continuous delivery, but it was also one of

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.300
the shows that just had so many little tips and tools and techniques that was like, so many

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.400
people wrote in and talked about it.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.280
It was like, it was awesome.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.200
And it was like, it was awesome, even if you don't care about CICD.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.240
So that was, that was fun.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.340
And then you came back and we talked about Python packaging and the options that you

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.060
explored there.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.460
Yep.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.740
Well, what I'm wondering though, is if somebody went to the internet and they did a search

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.840
for those things, would my site come up?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.700
I could tell you mine won't.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.620
Yeah.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.040
I've been reading a lot about what makes all of that work.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:03.140
So in running the stuff I do at TriExitPass, it's been interesting trying to understand how the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.060
internet actually works.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.780
You think you know how it works, but you don't.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.060
You think you actually have control over what you see and how you get to it, but you also

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.480
don't.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.020
So it turns out that a lot of that is filtered through a bunch of companies and those tend

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.020
to be mostly Google, but Bing plays a little role in it as well.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.620
So that's why, you know, if you've ever had the situation where like you're talking to a

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.520
buddy and you Googled something and you're like, why didn't you find it?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.780
I Googled it and it's right here.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.240
Yeah.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.980
Then your buddy Googles it and the search results are completely different.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.560
There's a lot of stuff that happens in that algorithm that really has an effect on how

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.360
well your pages show up on search results.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:51.700
Well, I think that that's a good indicator or data point for just how much the algorithms

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.120
are playing a role here, right?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.180
Like if I go and search for something when I'm logged in, I get different results than if

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.940
I search when I'm not logged in.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.120
And anytime I want to try to assess how is this thing actually ranking for the world?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.820
Like how is it really being relevant to others?

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.580
I go and open an incognito or private window and do my search there because there's a lot

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.480
of different things at play, right?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.380
There are a lot.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.220
And so for example, like I have, like I don't log in, like in my work account isn't tied at

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.380
all to my home stuff.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.380
The results are completely different when I'm at work and do Google searches.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.000
And so it's interesting because, you know, one of the main reasons the internet is what

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.820
it is, is like this freedom where everybody can post information and make it available

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.700
to the whole world.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.560
But actually it turns out there's all these gatekeepers that have come up in recent years

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.380
and it's all based on all the search algorithm and all the search engine rankings.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.700
Yeah.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.620
Everything is free and there's like this abundance of information.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.760
But when there's too much of an abundance, then it's not providing the information or

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.820
the actual information itself that's valuable.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.520
It's the filtering and the grouping and the directing you through and just mostly get rid

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.100
of all the stuff that's not there, right?

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.040
Like, what do I actually care about when I'm saying like, I need to learn this thing in Python

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.460
or I want to read something about this news event, right?

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.900
It's not that it's trying to show it all to me.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.380
The actual role is to like, not show me the stuff.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.900
Like, show me only what matters.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.780
Which I think is a, it's a little bit contradictory to the way the internet started, right?

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.440
Like it started out with like, I don't know.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.760
I think of Yahoo as like the most prototypical early, early, early days where it was literally

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.660
a directory.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.280
A directory, yeah.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.240
Like the yellow pages of the internet, right?

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.680
Yeah.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.500
That's right.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.060
So crazy.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.280
It's all been kind of like incremental steps on how to make it easier for you to find stuff,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.720
but also how does the search engine determine what is a valid result for you?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.000
But you know, by them doing that, that means they have applied a filter on all of the websites

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.220
in the world, right?

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.200
In order to do this.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.160
And if you're just a lonely old guy that wrote something that you just want to make it out,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.720
polish it out there, people finding it is not as easy as it sounds.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.880
Just publishing something on the internet these days is not enough.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.180
Yeah.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.380
It's not a field of dreams.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.860
That's right.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.520
Build it and they will come sort of thing, right?

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.380
So maybe let's take a real short step backwards and talk a little bit about TriExceptPass,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.080
what you're doing there, what you're trying to grow there and whatnot, just to give people

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.060
a sense of like, why are you studying these things?

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.860
What are you trying to do?

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.760
Sure, sure.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.500
So I started TriExceptPass almost five years ago now, which is kind of crazy.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.380
That's insane, right?

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.220
As a medium blog, right?

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.620
And so then I had the domain name, the TriExceptPass.org.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.000
And then I wanted to get off the platform and start building my own thing.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.540
So I have a website.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.480
There's a collection of articles about how to build real world software, problems you run

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.340
into with engineering and stuff like that.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.300
And now we have a podcast on top of it, right?

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.560
Yeah.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.740
Your podcast is pretty new, right?

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.140
You've got like six, seven episodes.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.080
We're up to episode eight this week.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.660
Yeah.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.920
Yeah.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.120
I'm going to be putting them out more regularly now.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.820
But yeah.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:08.300
So based on that, I really wanted to go hard on trying to get more visitors last year.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.500
And I started to read about what I needed to do in order to make that happen.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:19.920
And I have discovered all this stuff that I thought about SEO as SEO, meaning search engine

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.900
optimization, right?

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.380
Because we technically haven't defined the term.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.600
So when people talk about how to make your website visible in a search engine, they're

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.500
talking about optimizing it so that it shows up appropriately, right?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.200
So I had traditionally thought about this being more kind of like a keyword thing that maybe

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.800
marketing does or sales or somebody else does for a large company website.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.180
But I hadn't realized-

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.200
Yeah.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.860
The site works.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.680
I wrote it for you.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.640
Now it's up to you.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.980
That's right.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:43.380
Your turn.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:43.980
Here you go.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.080
You get it to rank, baby.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.400
Yeah.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.000
Fill in the fields and you're done, right?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.280
But it doesn't work that way.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.400
It turns out you need a bunch of hooks in there in order for it to actually be

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.100
picked up appropriately by the search engine algorithms.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:02.220
And I'm not just talking about the traditional, like there's always been these like robots.txt

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.820
files or sitemaps, XMLs that help search engines a little bit.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:12.920
But it's way, way deeper than that with a bunch of meta tags and formatting and a bunch

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.200
of stuff that we'll get into in a minute.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.680
Right.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:20.520
And performance is playing a much more significant role in SEO than it has traditionally.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.240
That's right.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.580
And one of the main things is that because mobile is such a big thing, then performance has become

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.140
a lot more important.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.540
It's always been important because the better performance you have, the more global access

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.380
your website gets because internet is not the best everywhere in the world.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:44.960
But with mobile, that has become more of an issue because not everybody has like the fancy

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.420
high speed phones, right?

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.260
Right.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:53.480
So it turns out that a lot of how your website is ranked is tied to that.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:53.660
Yeah.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.860
So I'm looking forward to talking about all of these things.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.980
I just kind of want to put it out there at the beginning though.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:04.260
I feel like that it's so easy to fall into the trap of, well, a little bit of like, if you

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.380
build it, they will come.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.060
Right.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:11.320
Like if I build something cool, people will eventually find it and it will rise to the

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:11.580
top.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.940
If I build some amazing site, some service, some product, whatever, I want people to come

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.420
check it out.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.280
If it has merit, people will come and love it.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:26.860
And you know, stuff like this, as you know, the SEO, as well as like the other sides of marketing

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.860
and just getting the word out, right?

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:35.540
It's so tricky and vague, but it is actually what you have to do to make that succeed, especially

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.460
in a world of abundance like we are now.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:37.760
Yeah.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.620
So building great content is just like step one.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:46.420
However, there is still an aspect of if you build it, they will come because if you built

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:51.100
something that's fantastic that everybody wants to read, then more web pages will link to it.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.480
And that also has an implication in your rankings as well.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:54.800
Yeah.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.300
But yeah.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.960
I'm sure you probably don't have any insight to this answer and I'm just speculating, but

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.540
you know, Google is built on page rank, which is sort of how many pages refer back to

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.880
a given page in super early days.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.220
That was like the primary link.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.640
And then people would go do stupid stuff.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.860
Like they would buy links on other domains, like just pages of links or other really shady,

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.700
stupid stuff.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:21.720
I wonder at some point though, when is like machine learning going to be the thing that

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.440
decides, right?

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.040
When is it going to be just like, well, there's a deep neural net.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.680
It already is.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:25.780
Yeah.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.200
You think so?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.320
Oh, it's big time.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.800
So that's why Google is pretty much an AI company.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.160
That's what they have, right?

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.960
Yeah.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.680
Vast amounts of machine learning to try to parse.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:42.080
I mean, these things are reading the content of your web pages to decide how to rank it.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.820
It's not just about links.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:49.440
It's about the structure, the grammar, how many images you have, how well the images are

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.400
formatted, how it flows, all that.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.800
All that's all machine learning.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.060
Wow.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:53.320
Okay.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:53.980
It's crazy.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.640
That's pretty awesome.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.300
Yeah.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.880
I didn't realize this was so advanced.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.740
I mean, I always kind of knew, but I didn't expect it to be this advanced.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.120
Yeah.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.940
Well, there's so much money behind it, right?

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:04.240
Yeah.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.480
Yeah.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:04.900
That's right.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.440
In terms of advertising, right?

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.380
It's one of the most valuable companies in the world.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.300
And that's basically makes them an advertising company.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.560
But the ads are around like this kind of stuff.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.220
So I can see, I guess so, why there's so much effort.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.740
And the other interesting part is, right, that ranking algorithm, the SEO algorithm that Google

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.360
uses generates entire industry.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.980
There's people that exist around how that algorithm works.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.660
And Google doesn't tell you how it works.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.380
It kind of gives you clues here and there.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.100
But what happens sometimes is they update it.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.500
And so then there's people that have been sitting at the top of the first page of your 10 results

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.920
off of Google and all of a sudden become number 100.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.640
And there's like real economic consequences out of that.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.980
Especially for like blogging community, people that live off of content that they produce

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.400
in smaller websites kind of thing.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.000
They're always on top of that.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.340
Right.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.880
So let's start with defining a couple of terms that you have here.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.500
One is domain rank and one is page rank.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:03.860
Yeah.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.300
So we've been talking about ranking a little bit.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.940
So what happens is each page in your website gets ranked.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.780
And there's a lot of things that come into that.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.480
And it's like you get a grade, right?

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.580
And the higher the grade, the better.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.120
From the tidbits of information I've been able to gather here and there, we just kind of talked

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.940
a little bit about it.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.700
It's the content matters.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.240
How many words in the page matter?

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.120
Grammar.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.640
How performance.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.800
We'll get into that later.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.900
The links from external websites that are linking to your page and the links from your

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.880
page that are going to external websites.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:46.120
Not just how many, but like what specifically, how that hierarchy is set up matters, right?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.320
And so that gives you a grade, right?

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.540
And so then to your page.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.380
But there's also a grade to your domain.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.120
So like I have track set pass ORG and that has a rank and that rank might, I just checked

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.500
just a little bit ago that rank was in the 30s, 33 or something like that, which is, I'm

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.540
actually happy about that, which is not a great rank, but it's good because I started in the

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.580
20s, but it took me a year to get to 33, right?

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:10.880
Yeah.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.000
Where do you check this rank?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.460
Yeah.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.740
So there's a bunch of tools that do this.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:20.500
So aside from Google having their own little internal search engine ranking stuff, there's

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.880
entire companies that do this.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.000
And so I use Moz.com, but there's also Alexa.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.760
I've seen some of those.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.240
They have some free accounts you can get with them that gives you some extra information and

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.800
allows you to do some searching and limits how many searches you can do.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.500
But you can also, you know, if you get like a full blown account, you can like get into

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.820
like many great details.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.360
But those guys keep their own thing too, right?

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.820
They give you a ranking, but it's not the ranking that Google's giving.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.000
It's just an approximation of what we think Google will be giving.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.740
And really, really the key player is Google.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.840
It's crazy.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.220
Yeah.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.620
I mean, there are other search engines, but they're pretty safe to just ignore them.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:00.860
Right.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.740
I mean, there's Bing.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.120
Yeah.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.620
Bing still gets a little bit.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.140
Yeah.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.800
And there's DuckDuckGo.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.400
Right.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:06.740
Yeah.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.500
Actually, I've been using DuckDuckGo for six plus months now as my primary search engine.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:12.820
Yeah.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.280
Okay.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.220
How's that experience been?

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.540
Yeah.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.540
It's been working nicely.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.160
I like it.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.560
And they got very similar tools to what you get out of Google search.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.840
But, you know, they're still building up their stuff.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.680
So every once in a while, you still got to do the Google search.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.080
I don't know.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.440
I've wanted to use DuckDuckGo.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.980
And I very much support the privacy side of things.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.100
Like, I would prefer to give less to Google.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.380
Although, I don't hate them.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.680
I think they offer a lot of great services.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.380
But I'm a big fan of using Firefox over Chrome, for example.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.680
And DuckDuckGo seems like a really easy choice.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:49.260
Like, searching for stuff is so essential that, like, even if it was down 5%, I feel like I really want to do that to myself.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:49.980
You know?

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:51.420
I get it.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:56.020
I'm trying to find that one, like, thread race condition for SQLAlchemy.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.020
Uh-huh.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.880
Like, I just don't want to, like, it's already, I'm already frustrated a lot of times if I'm in that kind of scenario.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.580
And I'm like, I really need the best answer.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.820
Like, the best answer.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.540
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.960
And so I've had a few of those lately.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.760
And, yeah, it helps, you know, the Google algorithm is better for some of that stuff.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:19.440
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Kite, the smart AI-powered autocomplete for your editor.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.480
As developers, our choice of editor is central to our work.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.260
The more powerful and effective that that editor is, the more effective that you are.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.160
That's why I'm excited about Kite.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:36.160
Kite is a free plug-in for your code editor that gives you ML-powered autocompletions and documentation.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.220

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.720
The list includes PyCharm, VS Code, Atom, Sublime, Vim, and more.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.700
And Kite runs locally.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.500
So your code is private with no cloud or internet connection necessary.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.420
And the Kite is 100% free.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.820
So try it today at talkpython.fm/kite, K-I-T-E.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.620
And see how Kite can help you be more effective with your Python code.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.240
We talked about domain rank and those kinds of things.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.080
So I went to Moz.com and I clicked on free SEO tools.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.940
And that comes up and says, enter your domain and we'll tell you a couple of things.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.720
And then I also went to a private incognito window and did a search.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.760
So one of the things that I am a little bit proud of, impressed with myself that I was able to do,

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.920
is that if you do a, it's super important that you're not logged in, right?

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.580
Because it totally could vary on your history.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.220
That's right.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:37.280
At least where I am now, at the time it is now, it's been here for a while.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.080
If I go to Google and I search for free MongoDB Python course,

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.620
the number one result is freemongodbcourse.com, which is my course for my,

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.180
like it's a landing domain.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:51.660
Good job.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.660
That's not easy.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:59.680
And like number three is MongoDB's actual free courses, right?

00:16:59.680 --> 00:16:59.980
Nice.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:00.800
Which are taught in Python.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.040
Nice.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.020
So I'm feeling really good about that.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.560
I put that into that domain.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.960
There's only one page there, right?

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.260
So I think that hurts it a little bit, but if the search lines up just right, it's okay.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:18.780
So because it only has one page, it is like a page, basically the domain authorities, 22.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:19.600
Yeah.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.680
So that's kind of okay.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.360
I'm not sure what to think about that, but it's low, but it's okay.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.760
It's low, but it's like one niche thing, right?

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.220
Yeah.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.100
It's ranking keywords are 36.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:29.940
I don't know what that is,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.860
but the spam score is only 2%.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.700
So that's pretty good.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.620
And then I threw a talkpython.fm in there and that's domain ranking of 49.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.240
Yes.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:38.900
That's very good.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.180
Yeah.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:39.760
That's awesome.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.860
And it's spam score is 1% and it has 1.6 thousand ranking keywords.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:45.280
Sure.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:45.620
Okay.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:45.920
Yeah.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:54.860
So the ranking keywords is the stuff that search engines would use to figure out whether to list your website as a result or not.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.220
Theoretically, the more you have, the more you have, the better.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:57.600
I see.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.940
It also shows you cool things like here are the top ranking keywords.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.520
Uh-huh.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.640
And it's right.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.980
I guess this is where it ranks.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.320
If you were to search for this, like Python podcast, it's number one.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.480
Async techniques and examples in Python, it's number one.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.180
That's kind of cool.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.660
And then it has like more by number of clicks.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:23.360
So it has like 100 days of code where we're not that high, but it's like there's a ton of search clicks for it.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.500
I feel like this actually gives me a lot of pretty interesting information.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:35.140
If there's another tool in there about link research and you can pop your website in there and it tells you the things that link to you.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.840
That's also important.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.240
Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:44.520
So we were talking about your rank, what links to you matters because it helps your rank.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:53.260
But the quality, like the domain authority of the sites that are linking to you is a modifier on how much that link matters to your website.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:53.560
Right.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.960
Because there are aggregators.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:03.120
So like I found that like I have a bunch of aggregators that link to me, but their domain authority is so low that they don't really affect.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.020
Those links don't really affect my stuff.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:05.200
Yeah.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.560
So it's like multiplying by zero, right?

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.340
These links are coming in, but they mean nothing because they're like so badly ranked.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:10.840
That's right.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:19.000
And interesting, we talked about like my domain rank for tracks that passes 33, but some of the pages in there have a different page authority.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.380
Like the microservices article of mine has the highest page rank of page authority of 52.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.320
Oh, that's pretty good.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:27.660
Yeah.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.760
It's interesting how all that plays a little bit.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:40.080
And so if you go to that tool that does some link research for you, it'll show you the number of links you have as well based by the domain authority of the linkers.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:49.180
And that brings me to something else we'll talk about later about how you do your A tags, your href tags in HTML and why that matters.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.800
We'll talk about that later.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.060
Yeah.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:57.400
I think there's some really some of these great tools out there that I think people just don't think to use.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:05.480
Like I used Moz a long time ago when I was setting up my training sites to try to understand how I might make it rank better.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:12.000
But then I actually forgot about, I didn't forget about Moz, but I like it went off my radar and I stopped using it.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.140
Like I literally haven't been to Moz.com or whatever the URL is for like a year.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:16.740
Right.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.020
But I should be going there frequently and like looking at how things are evolving.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.960
What are new trends and how can I get involved with that?

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.980
Like what has some traction and what can I make it grow?

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.280
Right.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.240
You got to be careful not to do it too often because all this stuff takes like weeks to propagate.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.540
It's like changing DNS servers or something.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.500
You know, it takes days.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.440
Well, this takes weeks.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.240
Does it work now?

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.140
Like, no, you need to stop asking.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:39.860
It's just wait a while.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.080
Yeah.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.360
Right.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:40.580
Yeah.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:46.660
So in terms of tools while we're on it, like the Moz one is great for getting domain ranks and links and stuff like that.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.680
But there is a Google search console as well.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.860
Have you used that one?

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:51.880
I have used that one.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.760
And that is pretty good.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.920
You can say, show me some of the keywords.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.440
How do I rank against them?

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.720
What are my popular keywords?

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:02.060
And you can trust that even a little bit better because it literally is from Google, right?

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.480
Google says here's how we would rank you for this thing.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:04.780
Yeah.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:10.480
And the interesting part is you get like how often people have been clicking in search results to your domain.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.920
You get total number of times you've shown people your domain.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.860
Like I was looking at my stuff.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.600
I have like 2% average click-through ratio is what they call it.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:25.880
So my domain's been shown 240,000 times in the last three months, I guess.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.240
And out of that, it's been clicked 4,800 times.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.460
And it gives me the average position that shows up on the Google search results.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:39.060
And the goal is, like you said earlier, to bump that into at least the top 10, right?

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.500
And depending on what...

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:46.560
And you can play with that to find which search keywords give the highest position.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.700
Like I have...

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.880
If you look for distributing Python applications, I'm number 4, according to the search console, right?

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.080
But the domain just in general is on average of 20.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.440
Okay.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.900
It's a lot of little things.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.760
Yeah, there are.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.820
So let's see.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.040
If I go here, yeah, 4.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.200
I got to have a range, I guess.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.380
This is over the last couple months.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.980
Search results, 18,688 total clicks.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.960
That's pretty cool.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.340
Yeah.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:24.180
The other one that's really interesting that I guess we should maybe talk about, this is like definitely on the developer side, is error pages, sitemats.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:24.480
Yes.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.540
That kind of stuff.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:31.500
Because the next graph that I see here is a graph that says, here's the coverage of our searching of your site.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:43.980
You have 3,573 valid pages, which might blow people's minds, but there's like all the courses and every lecture of the course has its own transcript landing page for SEO somewhat and for usability.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.480
Like there's a ton of pages.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.140
And it has the number of errors.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.660
Right now I have zero errors and 3,573 valid pages.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.700
And it shows the growth of errors over time and pages over time.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.980
And I put a lot of work into making sure that my sitemap is like complete.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.420
How much do you think that matters?

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.080
It's important.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.920
And they use the sitemap to figure out how to crawl.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.720
So not only is that important for your main page.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.880
So you have a staging page.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.420
I don't know how you do your stuff, but like I have like a staging version of Trax Set Pass where I try stuff out.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:22.760
You can configure stuff, not just with the sitemap, but with like robots.txt so they don't crawl those pages because you don't want those to show up

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.920
and affect your search results, especially because they're going to have errors and stuff like that.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.720
So as a developer, that's one of the things you got to worry about.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:35.080
I was working on a website for my company and application service a while back.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.180
And that's like we had a staging version.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.160
I didn't know about any of this.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:39.840
And I'm like, oh, man.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.200
So our domain, we had like staging.r stuff and just the regular production version.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.980
I'm like, oh, maybe all this affected our page rank out on the real internet.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:48.280
Right.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.100
Yeah.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.360
It's basically it might divide it by two, right?

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.740
Because it's the same content.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.480
And so.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:53.960
That's right.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.960
So that brings me, might as well talk about it now.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.400
So we've been talking about links.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:02.960
So having copies of your content counts against your rank.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.240
Right.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.480
It basically dilutes the value and then other things are able to get above it.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:07.700
Right.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:07.960
Yeah.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.580
So essentially, they try to figure out whether you're plagiarizing your own content, like

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.680
whether the domains are plagiarizing it, essentially.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.420
Right.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:15.680
Yeah.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:21.840
So if you have like the exact same article show up somewhere else, that becomes like that

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:27.220
whole page, that whole article, both yours and the other person's will have a lower ranking

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.520
compared to yours.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:33.760
And so that's why, like if you go to sites like dev.2 and you publish something there,

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:42.040
you can link to your article, to your original source, and you add an extra piece of information

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:46.740
in the tag, in the HTML tag that says this is a canonical link.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:52.980
So that means that the original source, you're pointing to the original source, and then the

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:58.060
search engines won't count dev.2 against your original article.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.420
And they'll actually complement each other.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:00.700
Right.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.180
Okay.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.900
So I ran into something like that recently.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:10.740
I had the strangest problem, which I came up with an even stranger solution to.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.340
I spent days, days trying to solve this problem.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:21.720
If you went to talkpython.fm/forward slash, or training. talkpython.fm/forward

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.820
slash, I don't remember which of those two sites it was that had the problem.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.700
They're both on, they're both on Ubuntu 18.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.560
They're both running Nginx.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.680
They're both running the same type of certificate.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.540
They're basically identical servers.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:39.160
One of them in Safari, whether it was mobile, like this is actually where it matters a lot.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.600
It's like all of iOS.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.760
You would go to one of them.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.400
It would say it was an error where like the site said it disconnected.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.720
Like the connection was reset was the error.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.520
You look at the logs and it was fine.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.700
You look at the logs and it was fine, right?

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.140
I see.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:52.480
Yeah.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.680
But any other page on the site was fine.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.820
Like slash episodes was fine.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.060
Slash about was fine.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:03.080
Slash anything other than slash home was fine on one server.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.220
The other server was fine everywhere.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:11.100
I spent days trying to figure this out and figure out what the different, like everything I could tell with the two servers were set up the same.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.420
And I just finally said, you know what?

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:23.080
If iOS is happy with slash anything, but the slash like by itself, I'm just going to redirect it to slash home and have slash home be like a copy of the homepage.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.760
That is for anytime I detect Safari.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:36.940
I'm like, dude, we're just going to redirect you to like another URL that's deeper in the site, but it shows the same content because that one renders fine and just the forward slash it over.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.140
Right.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.280
So I was like, forget this.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.620
But what I didn't think about was the SEO impact of that.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.620
Right.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.360
Because if Google comes as today, I want to be Safari.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.040
Let's see what's up.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:53.780
Like, oh, I'm over on this other page, which looks like the same content as Chrome saw yesterday on forward slash.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.880
One of the listeners said, you know, you have the same content.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.660
You really should use this rel equals canonical on there.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:08.940
And so what I did to like stop undermining myself while still making iPhones work was to just put like do a test.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:17.440
Like if it's slash home in the template, just put a meta tag that says or whatever kind of tag says rel canonical is the forward slash URL, not the forward slash home URL.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:17.980
That's right.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.100
But this can be used in other places.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:26.540
Like if you want to write on Medium, but also on your blog, but have your blog get the SEO juice.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.380
I don't know if it works on Medium.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.740
It works in some place like Dev2 and other places, right?

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.000
Dev.2 has it like in there stuff to set it up.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.840
You have the capability of doing that.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.000
In Medium, I know you can add some HTML stuff in there.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.640
So it might.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.660
That's one of the reasons I got off of Medium a while back.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.980
Honestly, I'm not a fan of Medium.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.720
I think it's a beautiful site.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.220
It's a nice experience, but I, it just, there's just.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.520
The paywall killed it for me.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.780
Dude, there's just too many things that go against the grain.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.940
Like I'm not even against a paywall.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.440
Somebody says like, I want to do like deep writing and have people pay for that.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.540
That's great.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.380
Like that's, that's their work and their choice.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:06.540
But I feel like Medium was built up on the back of this is a free place that people can do awesome writing.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:10.180
Let's all get together and then like yank on the rug and now it's paid.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:10.500
Right.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:10.880
You know what I mean?

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.820
It's like, I feel like they didn't build on that ethos.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.320
And so it's like a bait and switch.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:15.340
Yeah.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.560
That's what I don't like it.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.160
Yeah.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.040
Yeah.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.020
Yeah.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:19.800
That's what killed it for me.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.280
And so like for me that switched off of Medium, it was really hard.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.740
I mean, I used to get people following me on the Medium article.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.280
Right.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.720
And I'm like, how do I bring that traffic to my website?

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.140
Right.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:31.540
Yeah.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:31.960
Yeah.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.940
For sure.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:38.620
So while we're on it, this is not exactly SEO, but it does talk about rank and keyword and relative

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:38.940
stuff.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.120
And it's really good for exploring other sites.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.960
So have you played with SimilarWeb, SimilarWeb.com?

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.360
No.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.940
I saw you added the link.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.120
I pulled it up, but just barely looked at it.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:51.380
Yeah.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.200
So if you go in there and you just type in any domain, like you could type in like talkpython.fm

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.500
or you could talk real Python or try accept paths.org, whatever you want.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.940
It'll come up with a ranking.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.940
It only has like tons of information for sites that are ranked well enough, but it will show

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.740
you like traffic over time month by month.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:08.400
Right.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.780
So right now it says I'm getting 56,000 unique visitors a month who spend an average of four

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:20.980
minutes and visit 3.45, 3.42 pages and so on during their visits.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.600
And this is not because there's plugs.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.680
I don't even show up.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:23.920
It's not.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.120
Yeah.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.960
Well, it's got to get to like a certain level.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.200
Right.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:30.180
But you could take any, like if you have a competitor or something you're trying to

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.440
like, Hey, we're building a site.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.780
We want it to rank.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.900
Here's some of our competition and they're ranking well.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:40.520
So you can put that in there and you can see like traffic by countries, traffic sources,

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.960
the referrals, the places that are linked, like you talked to linking into it.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:50.640
So apparently GitHub, python.org, forums.fast.ai, all these are like strong linking, referring

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.660
sites to mine.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.560
Not because I know that, but because this external thing is like tracked it just.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:55.880
Yeah.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.320
Okay.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.660
Whether the traffic is paid.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:02.980
So this is a good one for like how, then you could put another domain next to it and

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.860
it'll put those charts next to each other and say, here's how you compare to that other

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:10.660
place in general ranking traffic, types of traffic and whatnot.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.880
I could have sworn that some of this was also available in Moz.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.900
If I find it, I'll give you a link.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.700

Oh, and one last thing.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.440
They're hiring.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.560
Go to linode.com slash careers to find out more.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.880
Let them know that we sent you.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.840
That type of analysis is really, really interesting and useful.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.200
Yeah.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.260
Because, yeah, that helps determine how well your stuff is going to show up.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:33.360
So, speaking of moths, they wrote a pretty interesting article called The Beginner's Guide to SEO,

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.040
which you're linking to.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.980
We'll put it in the show notes.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.220
Yeah.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.700
And we've heard of Maslow, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right?

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.780
You need shelter and then you need like human contact.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.840
You know, then you need food or maybe you need food, then shelter, right?

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.220
But whatever, like eventually way, way up there is like entertainment and fulfillment.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.480
You know what I mean, right?

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.080
That's right.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:53.400
Yeah.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:58.680
So, there's something like they put together like this for SEO and says like, you must have

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.700
this to be ranked.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.660
And then like you can be more competitive as you layer on more advanced stuff.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.500
Do you want to talk us through that?

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:04.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.560
So, we can go through the pyramid and some of these we'll dive into a little more detail

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.540
in a little bit.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:15.560
So, like right at the bottom, right, is crawl accessibility.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:21.300
So, that means that your website must be the search engine crawlers, the robots that go out

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.780
and just scrape the internet and formulate the model or whatever to find search results.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.500
Your website needs to be crawlable, essentially.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:34.220
And that means you have to have good HTML and good things for those robots to actually be able

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.680
to parse the information.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:35.960
Right.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.180
And that's a little bit like what I was talking about with the sitemap and the number of pages

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.260
versus the number of discovered pages.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.000
Right.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.240
But it also means like if you go to a part of your site is behind a login or a paywall or

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.240
some other interaction, that is blind to the world.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:51.520
Right.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.780
That is no longer part of the search index of the world.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.880
And so, you just got to like, it might be fine.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.040
That might be your personal account info or whatever.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:00.900
You don't want it to be.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:05.960
But sometimes I see people building sites in a way that I think, oh, you don't want to do

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.820
that because Google's not going to get there.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.280
And that's a problem.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:10.580
Yeah.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:16.820
So, that's why single page web apps are an interesting, have an interesting situation

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.420
when trying to be searchable.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:24.080
So, you'll find that a lot of like say, just to pick something like say Linode or whatever.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.520
And I'm not saying that they are a single page web app.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:31.440
But you'll find that a lot of these companies that have consoles or something that some application

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.680
type of thing that's available through the website, they actually have a landing page.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.500
And then from the landing page, you can load up the web app.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:44.080
You can't have the whole thing be the web app or the stuff just won't start, won't show

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:44.940
up on the search engine.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.300
It's behind JavaScript.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:46.840
Exactly.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:52.480
If you look at Vue Source of like a VJS app, it's entirely underwhelming.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.000
And it always looks the same because the data is not loaded yet, right?

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.440
That's right.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:02.640
And in fact, it might even count against you, which is like the next ring in the pyramid

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.820
is having compelling content.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.720
The only thing that the search engine will find there is just JavaScript.

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:14.180
So, it's not going to know what any of that means or what the paragraphs are, what the

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.120
information is, nothing.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.320
So, that's it.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.660
Yeah, I'm wondering if these days, if like when Google sees that, they're like, you know

00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:25.220
what, we have to fire up Selenium and hit this page to like get the answer, right?

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:29.480
They may look for Vue.js, Angular, the couple popular ones and say, we got to-

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.160
Yeah, I'm sure they do.

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:30.920
We got to do a little more.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.980
They probably do.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.420
But it can't be helping, right?

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:39.040
Like even if eventually it does figure it out, I just feel like these spa apps cannot be helping

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.900
their SEO case.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.260
No.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.340
There is some stuff that's been built to help all of that.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.560
I haven't looked too much into it, but there are things to help that side of the world.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:48.320
Yeah.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:48.600
Yeah.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.100
Okay.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.160
So, compelling content, that's important.

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.560
It's sometimes tricky to do.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.220
I suspect like images.

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.220
Like if you try to tell the story with a picture instead of with words, that might actually hurt

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.740
you a little bit in terms of SEO.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:06.840
But when you make that image tag, you can have enough information in the image tag, which also

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.620
helps the rankings.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:09.940
Like in the title or the alt or something like that?

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.800
The alt, yeah.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.160
Okay.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.580
So, there's that.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:17.240
And then just like the size of the content, just general grammar stuff, how the paragraphs

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.840
are broken up, how many.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.900
In fact, having content for multiple languages also counts for you.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.340
There's all kinds of stuff like that.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.700
And if you're doing like international stuff like that, where you have like multiple versions

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:31.840
of your site, that's like a whole new, like I wanted to do that recently because I wanted

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.140
to, you know, Spanish is actually my first language.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.980
So, I wanted to write the site in Spanish and provide a Spanish version of it.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.220
And I started to look into, wait, what about like the canonical stuff?

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.260
And like, what's going to show up here?

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.240
And it's like, there's all these rules.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.980
I was like, I don't have time to look at all of this.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.840
It was already going to be a lot of work to rewrite it in a second language.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.540
And now you've got to like re-SEO it.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:57.300
And like, not just redo the SEO, but you got to make sure you don't hurt yourself, right?

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.180
Because if it shows up in two languages, it could be worse than just having one if

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.020
it thinks that's like copied, right?

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:03.440
Yeah.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.480
When we're talking about this, you know, we're not just talking about like, do I have the right

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.340
keywords, which is actually the next ring in the pyramid, you know, having,

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:17.620
having the words that are searchable that represent what the article is about, right?

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.900
But we're talking about like, just like HTML formatting, right?

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:27.460
If you don't have the right tags in the right places with the right properties, stuff doesn't

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.500
get picked up correctly.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.920
And I mean, as a developer, I mean, it makes perfect sense.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.040
Somebody wrote some code to go and crawl this website, right?

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.760
And, you know, they're at Google.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.180
They're like, well, I'm going to look for this.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.180
If you don't put that in there, oh, well, right?

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.300
You want me to rank you?

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.880
Well, then put that in there.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.640
And Google's got like, they're all documented.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.520
All that stuff as you search around.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.180
Yeah.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:47.700
Yeah.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.200
For sure.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.800
Next up, I guess, keyword optimize.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.460
Is that, have we talked about that yet?

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:52.760
Yeah.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.920
That's what we were just talking about.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.220
Yeah.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:54.440
Okay.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.740
Then above that is the great user experience.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.480
Now we start getting a bit deeper into actual developer action.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:01.780
Yeah.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:08.320
And this is where the developer story starts to like really be your story around SEO.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.540
I mean, obviously you've got to have crawl accessibility, right?

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:16.900
If your site crashes, if it's unreliable, if it doesn't generate the site map quickly or

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.980
correctly, then all those things are right.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.380
Like you're not even like alive on the hierarchy.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.700
You're at the bottom and you're not there.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.840
But here you have things like fast load speed and ease of use.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:33.540
And the wording here is compelling UI on any device, but like the developer word is like

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.940
a program.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:35.440
Not a program.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:35.860
Yeah.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.500
Like viewports and like responsive is the word I was looking for.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:44.180
Responsive UI that, that like actually will look right on the device.

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:44.720
That's right.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.280
Now you're well into the web developer, Python developer side of the story.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:54.740
And there is so much here and we can talk, skip ahead a little bit around making your load

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.260
times better.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.280
There's a bunch of tools.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:01.520
There's some, there's a website from Google called PageSpeed, which you can go and plug

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.060
in a URL and it'll go do these rankings for you, these checks for you.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:06.240
Yeah.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.640
And then there's a tool called Lighthouse, which runs on Chrome.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.960
So if you have Chrome developer tools, you can get it to actually launch and run it locally.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:20.220
And so what it does is it analyzes a website and you can ask it to do it, do an analysis,

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:25.340
assuming you're running from a desktop or assuming you're running from a mobile phone with a fast

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.420
speed or assuming you're running from a mobile phone with a slow connection, right?

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:35.100
And it'll do all this analysis and you'll get into a bunch of things like what format are

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:35.580
your images?

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.540
You know, are you PNG?

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.360
Are you JPEG and all that, right?

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.820
And then it turns out that do they have the right compression ratios?

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.080
How big are they relative to the page?

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.940
Are you loading a 2000 pixel white image on a 400 pixel white page?

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.600
You're just wasting people's time when you do that, right?

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.200
Right, right.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.620
And when I logged into the Google search engine console that you talked about before, I got

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:00.100
a big pop-up that said, there's one of these domains I hadn't visited for a while.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:06.220
And it said, your site has now been switched to mobile first indexing.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:06.780
That's right.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.620
That's right.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:13.460
And one of the considerations is, does this page render good on a mobile phone?

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:17.160
And they also think, when they think about performance, I think a lot of developers, they

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.960
think, okay, and I totally count myself among this group in the early days.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.280
And I'd like to hear your thoughts as well as I go and I hit the server.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.820
How fast is the database?

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.700
How fast is Pyramid, Flash, Django, whatever, getting out the door?

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.720
Like, how quick am I getting like first byte to user, basically?

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.400
And then that's kind of like, I'm done.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.140
Like, I've solved it.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.640
Like, now it's down to the browser to deal, right?

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:40.200
Yeah.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.880
But that's just the beginning, right?

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.660
That's what you learn, apparently, when you try to like start doing this analysis.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.540
Oh, my goodness.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.100
Yeah.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.040
I did my stuff.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.600
My stuff is a static page.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.960
So like, I was like, oh, yeah, this is awesome.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.220
It just loads the page.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.240
It's going to blaze.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.680
There's nothing else to worry about.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.340
One millisecond.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:57.740
We're good.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.100
I'm good.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.980
So what did you get when you first put it into the PageSpeed Insights, which is like

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.240
the hosted version of Lighthouse?

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:04.840
Do you remember?

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.600
I was probably like in the 60s.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:07.920
Yeah.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.900
Or something like that.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.340
And so that has a ranking zero to 100, right?

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.780
So zero to 100.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:17.340
I put training.talkpython.fm in there and then talkpython and then Python bytes and whatnot.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.240
And those sites are crazy fast in the way I described.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:25.460
Like the database, the first byte out of the server is really fast.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.440
It's like totally reasonable to have a page that's 10 milliseconds.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.580
And I'm like, well, how could it possibly be slow?

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.160
So let's see what amazing numbers I get if I throw it in here.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.700
And I got like 50.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.740
And it says, which is on the bottom end of moderately slow.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.200
And I'm like, what is that?

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.600
What is this?

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.120
What is going on?

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.440
And so I spent three days going through the recommendations, like three eight-hour days

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.560
working on one of the sites.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:53.400
And now I've got it up to, if I go to training.talkpython.fm, on mobile, I get 94.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.640
And on desktop, I get 100.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.000
Cool.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.400
Yeah.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:55.740
Nice.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.620
I'm in the 90s as well now, finally.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:57.820
Yeah.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.020
And there's flexibility, right?

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:03.060
Like if the server hasn't requested a page, it might be a slightly, there's like, there's

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.040
some variability here.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.480
And it's even if you just rerun it.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:12.100
But what's interesting is the 94 is the mobile version, like how fast can't, if you've got

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.920
an image that has to be resized, it's one thing to do it on a high-end desktop.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:20.240
But if the phone has to resize it, that's going to hurt your ranking because it's like computationally

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.680
slow for the phone to render the page.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.460
And there's all these different layers of stuff that you've got to look at.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.940
I mean, if you just loaded the image itself the wrong size, it's bigger.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:35.060
So you just sent the phone extra data that it's not really needed, right?

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:35.520
Yeah.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.720
So to stick with it, so there's a few pieces here to stick with the images.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:46.280
So the first thing that the Google stuff recommends is to use WebP as the format, not PNG, not JPEG,

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.280
as a compression format for your images.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.340
And that's great.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:49.840
It works great.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:54.580
It's, you know, it's usually lower image sizes, which is why they recommend it.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.780
It's Google's proprietary image format, right?

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:58.900
That's right.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.040
Of course they're going to recommend it.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.620
So I was like, I did all this.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.240
I'm like, I got my stuff into the 90s.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.180
We'll get to the rest of it in a minute.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:09.300
I'm like talking to a buddy at work that also runs some websites and stuff.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.940
And he pulls out his iPhone and goes to my website.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.880
It's like, oh, that's cool.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.300
Yeah, yeah.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.920
Hey, what's up with your images?

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.360
I'm like, what do you mean?

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:21.700
Safari doesn't render WebP because Apple, right?

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.280
Yeah.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:28.860
So that leads to you, in order to do this correctly, you can no longer use the image

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.220
tag.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.700
You have to use the picture tag.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.620
There's a picture tag?

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.820
This is like totally changing my, like blowing my mind.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:34.340
Yes.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.560
And the picture tag has fallbacks.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.460
Okay.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.000
So I'm trying to find the good one I have on my site.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:47.140
But essentially, you can specify a list of images and you say, if the screen size is of

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.040
this many pixels, load this image.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.200
If it's of this many pixels, load this image.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.900
If the, you know, whatever.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.560
And then in the end, if you can't load any of those, load this image.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:00.900
So I had like, so for every image in my website, and that's important for me.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.360
So in Dragset Pass, we do illustrations and they come on.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.600
Like, I'm like, I want to load, you know, the 4,000 pixel illustration because it's really

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.340
nice, right?

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:09.660
Yeah.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.720
But obviously I can't.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.280
So I have four different files for every image.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.980
Each one optimized, you know, there's like a one at like,

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.400
I think it's 1280 pixels.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.420
I do one in the 800s and one in the 400s.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.100
And then I automatically pick which one to use with the picture tag.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:31.540
And then I also have a PNG format for the people that are using Safari to render it.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:31.740
Yeah.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.020
That sounds really tricky, right?

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.120
Because now you've got to have all these different types.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.500
And then how do you know about like the 404 missing image?

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.800
Because you viewed it on a device that supports that.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.820
It selected a different format and whatnot.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:45.380
Yeah.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:45.720
Yeah.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.460
So I haven't gone down that path on the...

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:52.580
I was going to export it to JPEG with a slightly lower quality and make sure the sizes...

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.960
Like I might have multiple sizes that are all JPEG or like one's PNG and a bunch are smaller.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.500
Sure.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.740
But I don't know.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.100
Like the varied support, it just threw me off.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:06.140
I'm just like, I just don't know that I want to go down this path of having like unsupported

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.800
image types that I've got to swap out, take care of.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.240
Yeah.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.520
That was an interesting adventure for me.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.880
Continuing down that, you get the screen optimizations and the fallbacks with the picture tag.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.140
Yeah.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.220
But outside of images, right?

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:23.440
These days, people use CDNs a lot to load things that run on their website.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:27.780
So I have delivered a static webpage and I need jQuery to do something.

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:30.120
I go link to some CDN that has jQuery.

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:34.680
Well, that's yet another connection that client's browser needs to open.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.120
And that connection is going to open to a different server, which means you guys know how this works,

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:39.340
right?

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:45.800
If I went to tracksetpaths.org, I did a DNS query to figure out what IP address it was, open

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.080
a TCP connection, download some data.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:54.240
If I'm talking about JavaScript, I'm then parsing that and loading it up, right?

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:54.560
Right.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:01.100
Well, now if I have an extra script tag in there, now I have to do that same thing for

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:04.180
whatever DNS is providing, whatever domain is providing that.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:07.520
So if that's coming from, you know, Google Fonts, right?

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.180
So that's got to do the DNS query, open up Google Fonts, download the font, do whatever

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.660
parsing and show it in the website.

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:19.280
So for every CSS or script or external thing that loads into your page, you're doing all of

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.440
these things and that has an impact and that actually shows up.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:29.200
And it counts against you regardless of whether it's a CDN link, a second link on your site

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.480
or like, it's just number of connections we got to do.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.340
The more, the worse.

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.440
Yeah.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.480
It's more work for the client, for the browser, right?

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:36.720
Yeah.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:42.280
So in order to help that around, there's a number of things that you can do in your header,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:47.500
in your HTML that will serve as preloads.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.700
So there's a couple of different commands.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:56.320
There's the link tag, like you would add a style sheet or whatnot, but there's also, there's

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.440
a rel property that you can set to preload or pre-connect.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:04.520
And pre-connect means do the domain name resolution.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:09.880
So that means you do that once because ahead of time, like for example, the Google Analytics

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:16.040
that get added to my website, I do a pre-connect to Google Analytics so that that, all of that

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:16.520
is resolved.

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.060
The TCP connection is already open at the start of the page.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:23.340
And by the time it makes it all the way to the bottom and actually needs to load something,

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.380
it just needs to go and get data versus having to.

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:26.760
Right.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.840
It's probably done the DNS resolve and actually already done the SSL exchange.

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.600
That's right.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.420
The port opening to the server even maybe.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.660
That's right.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:42.020
And for that one, I needed to pre-connect because the get changes slightly.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.940
I'm looking at dumping the whole Google Analytics stuff.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.780
So at some point that, that's a different conversation we should also have.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.080
I've since dumped them.

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:49.940
So yeah, I hear you.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:55.080
There's also a preload command you can give out, which actually essentially just loads the

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.180
file that you say.

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.160
It just loads it and keeps it in memory.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.380
It doesn't use it immediately.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:01.080
It's just there.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.500
And then when you run into it in the rest of the document, then it uses it.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.180
So I use that for like the fonts.

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.980
The fonts get preloaded and some JavaScript gets preloaded and stuff like that.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:10.180
Yeah.

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:14.500
I just recently saw my first page that was like full of these preloads and pre-connects.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.520
And I'm like, oh, this is the thing that I didn't know about.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.020
How interesting.

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.680
And it's clearly like, we're going to set this up and fire these off.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.400
And like, as soon as you can get them, as soon as you got a break and loading stuff,

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.000
go get these.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.200
And yeah, that seems pretty cool.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:33.720
Another one that will probably basically not help you on PageSpeed, on the Google PageSpeed

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:37.540
site, but will really make your users happy is just browser caching.

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:37.960
Yes.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.780
And there's different aspects of that and different problems that it generates.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:48.780
You can give the browser instructions on what to cache and how long to cache it for.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:49.100
Yeah.

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:53.000
And the PageSpeed stuff actually takes that into consideration for how long you're caching

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:53.400
things.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:53.760
Yeah.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.120
I actually took advantage.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:01.600
So I have like a set default kind of thing, but I also took advantage of using, I use Cloud

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.920
Flare in front of the website.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.560
So I can dynamically change that in Cloud Flare depending on what it is.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:12.980
So I can add like rules that say, well, tell our clients to cache the images for a year,

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:13.840
right?

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.780
Because I'm not going to change the image for an article.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.440
Right.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.760
But only cache the HTML for a week or something like that.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:19.960
Yeah.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.480
Interesting.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:21.340
Yeah.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:22.220
On mine, I have it.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:26.980
Every CSS, JavaScript, image, everything is cached, I think for a year.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:27.360
Yeah.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.140
And they recommend the really high number.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:29.520
Yeah.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.640
And it's really good in terms like speed.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.440
Like I was at a hotel in Israel and trying to get back to some sites.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.160
So they were all just dragging.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:43.540
And mine is like zip, zip, zip, because it just exchanges just the HTML and nothing else.

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:43.820
Right.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.240
One connection, everything else is out of the browser.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.280
Like this is really super cool.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:48.900
Is it working well?

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:54.400
The problem is if you change anything, like you update your style, then it's all busted,

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:54.680
right?

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:59.140
That's where a question mark and some hash comes into play.

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:05.320
I have a whole infrastructure that says, here's the URL and on the server side, generate a hash,

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:08.160
like cache ID equals whatever the hash is.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.540
And if that file changes, it's going to rehash it.

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.560
So it's an entirely different thing that's cached, again, for a year.

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:17.920
Like it might use up another 200K of somebody's browser cache, but who cares, right?

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.840
It's memories cheap.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.340
Yeah, sure.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:26.560
So on that, right, there's, aside from the caching, right, don't forget that any JavaScript

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:35.700
or CSS that you give out to your customers, you want that to be minimized, right?

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:38.420
And that means, what does minimization mean?

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:42.120
That means removes all of the spaces, for example.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:42.620
Yeah.

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:45.980
You also want fuelification, which is a bundle.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:46.400
That's right.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.820
You want less of them and you want them to be smaller, taken as an aggregate.

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:51.360
That's right.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.980
And so then like there are minimizers.

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:58.060
Google has a tool that you can use for minimizing CSS and JavaScript.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:03.420
And it's not just removing spaces, but it also, like in the case of JavaScript, it'll rename

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.240
all your variables.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:04.880
Oh, interesting.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.340
Okay.

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:07.320
So it does a little bit of obfuscation, right?

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:11.860
So if you have a, like as a developer, you want to have descriptive variables, but the

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:16.600
tools will actually take that variable name down to one letter as much as you can.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.100
Okay.

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:24.500
So you'll find your users.username, users.email, whatever can turn into A.B.A.C.

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.060
Right.

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:25.520
Right, right.

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:26.080
Yeah.

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.740
Which can be significant.

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:28.380
Yeah.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.260
For the right app.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:33.840
Just the whole point of that is to reduce the size of the file that you're transferring

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.040
to the clients.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.800
Right.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:35.960
Right.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.080
You want to reduce the size.

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.300
And if you can, you want to bundle them.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:43.360
That doesn't always work because sometimes like the JavaScript might refer to a relative

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:48.360
path back to like an image or a CSS file or something.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.940
And then like if you bundle them up, up the directory, then they get all broken.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:53.620
I had something like that with font awesome.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:54.300
I had to stop.

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:58.900
I'd like unbundle font awesome or something because it was, it couldn't find pieces of itself.

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.440
There's some tricky stuff as it refers between files.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:01.700
Yes.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:08.580
But theoretically, which is contrary to usual programming practices, the more that you can

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.620
put all of this stuff in the one file, right?

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:15.360
So if you can combine, so there's a, the tools will do that for you too.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:21.100
If you load jQuery and font awesome and, you know, bootstrap and a bunch of JavaScript and

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:25.220
then the JavaScript for your website, you can run it for these tools and it'll put everything

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.040
into one file and then minimize it.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:27.240
Yeah.

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:31.680
And so then you're transferring one thing, which means one TCP connection, one request,

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.980
and you're just moving data back.

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:37.780
Well, let's say one thing that I came across and started using exactly in this space when

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:41.580
I was going down the lighthouse thing, as I said, you're making 26 requests for JavaScript

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:42.600
and CSS.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.540
Oh my gosh, I'm done.

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.120
Like there's nothing I can do to like, how can I fix this?

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:47.320
Right.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.560
And I knew about bundling, but I'm like, this is going to be a lot of trouble because I,

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.720
I like to have small CSS files.

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.740
Like this part of the site has its own CSS file.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.960
So it's not huge and I can reasonably deal with it.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.140
Right.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:00.900
But, but Google was hating on it because it's like, here's another request.

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.740
I'm like, yeah, but it's cash for a year, but it doesn't matter.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.040
My page rank is what they say.

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.120
And it's the first request, not the cash request.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:08.740
So whatever.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:09.000
Yep.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.480
Along those lines, there's a progressive web apps.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:12.760
Yeah.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.240
If folks have heard about that.

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:18.900
So a track set pass is a PWA, progressive web app.

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:24.520
I think that's, I might disable that, but what that does is it makes your, you can write a

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:29.180
little bit of JavaScript that will make your website run even when your site is not online

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:30.560
as much as possible.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.140
And it can be executed.

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:39.100
Like if you're, you can actually make a shortcut to the site.

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.920
So you'll have like a, an icon just for your site.

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.740
You can just click it and it'll come online.

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:47.320
And all that JavaScript does is it registers what they call a worker.

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:54.760
And the, every request that the webpage makes for content goes through this worker essentially.

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.480
And the worker, you can do whatever you want with it.

00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.500
But the main point is the worker keeps a local cache.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.100
And the worker knows what to pre-cache.

00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:06.960
So when your website comes online, it says load all these images for you.

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:11.080
And then for every request, go get them and load it into a cache.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.860
It gets stored in local storage in your web pages.

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.120
You can see it all in developer tools.

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:20.720
And so then, you know, that makes your website run fast and you can even have an off, you'd

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.220
have to have an offline page.

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:26.980
So if you need to like fetch the content and you can't get to it, you can provide the users

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:28.460
and like, oh, I can't get to the internet right now.

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:29.220
This is what it looks like.

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:29.500
Okay.

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:29.840
Yeah.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.440
That's really cool.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:34.620
What I came across was this thing called web assets.

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:35.980
All one word.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:36.160
Yeah.

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:36.800
Yeah.

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.620
Which is a Python library that does that bundling and minification you're talking about.

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:46.920
It uses JS min and CSS min, which are Python packages that do that for JS and JavaScript

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.500
and CSS.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:52.380
And so now when my site starts, it just does like a quick check.

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.780
Hey, do I need to rebuild the one giant CSS and JavaScript files?

00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:00.600
So I don't have to remember to take it and like, oh, I forgot to run that.

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:01.280
So that's out of date.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.320
Like, it's just like at the start, it goes, here's the hash of the files.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.080
Is there anything new?

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.080
Let's regenerate them.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.380
And it's kind of just all automatic.

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:08.660
Right.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.760
So that's a pretty good set of Python tools.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.060
Nice.

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:11.260
Yeah.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:12.880
I knew about this at work.

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.720
I actually hadn't thought about looking at that for the stuff I have at home for some

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:15.980
reason.

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:16.460
Yeah.

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:16.960
I'll have to go.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:17.920
I'll have to go see.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.120
It might help me out with a few things.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.560
I have a really quick one that will totally help people.

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:27.960
This one only works on macOS, but I think they link to other options on their site.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.320
An image optim.

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.520
I am AJ, like image O-P-T-I-M.

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:40.460
And what it is, is like a, just a collection of algorithms that do lossless recompression

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.380
and re-encoding of images.

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:42.780
Okay.

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:43.200
Right.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.220
So like you visually, literally there's no visual change to what's happening, but it might

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.100
re-encode it.

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:53.360
Like it might change the color spectrum for a PNG because it realizes only 256 colors.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:53.680
Oh, that's pretty cool.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:54.100
Right.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:58.100
And so what you can do is you can take just the root of your website and throw it at this.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:03.240
It will traverse the directories, find all the things and in place, replace them with their

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.100
optimized but unchanged version.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:05.680
Nice.

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.680
That's pretty cool.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.220
Yeah.

00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:10.160
I did this on my sites and I got like 40% less.

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:15.200
It went from like 20 megs of images to, I don't know, whatever that was like nine.

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.920
And you just, it takes forever, but you just literally drag, drop, wait, done.

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:21.220
Cool.

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.140
I'll check it out.

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:22.420
Yeah.

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:25.760
So I was going to say on the image side, I use, I was talking about WebP earlier.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.640
I forgot to mention it.

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:32.080
I use C WebP, which is, you can just go install it and it'll produce WebP images and you can

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.700
have it resize the images for you.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:38.060
You feed it like a JPEG and PNG and it'll put out that kind.

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:38.400
Yeah.

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.100
And you can define what quality you want and what size you want for the image.

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:43.780
So you even resize it automatically for you.

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.020
Cool.

00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:44.400
Yeah.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.280
Those are, I like those because they're so easy.

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:49.800
Like they take no work and they're like, as long as you got your stuff in GitHub, checked

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.580
in, source control, like you're not in real danger of messing up stuff.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:52.900
Yeah.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:53.180
Yeah.

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:53.620
That's right.

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:54.060
That's right.

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:54.440
Yeah.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:54.800
Yeah.

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:58.000
All right, Chris, we're getting kind of closer to the end of the show, running short on time.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.260
I feel like we've just scratched the surface though, you know?

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:00.740
Yeah.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:04.880
What else, like quickly, what else should we like point out for folks that they should go

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.380
check out?

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.300
We can talk about a few pieces.

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:10.420
So in Google search, so okay.

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:13.000
Trying to figure out which one works best.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.060
So you put a link in Twitter.

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:15.900
Yeah.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:20.860
Twitter pulls up like a little card with an image and a little summary of the website or

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:21.680
whatever it is that you like.

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:21.880
Right.

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.600
For the cool sites it does, right?

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.260
Yeah.

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:24.580
Right.

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:25.320
Like ours, right?

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:25.760
Exactly.

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:29.980
So all that is configured through meta tags and there's actually a standard, there's

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:30.320
a Twitter.

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.680
It seems like Twitter came first or maybe just Twitter was different.

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.540
Everyone else seemed to grab it or whatever, right?

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:35.940
Yeah.

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:42.520
There's a thing it's called Open Graph that describes a set of meta tags you can put into

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:49.300
your website to provide a title, a description, a summary, what image you want to use for that

00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:54.800
little summary, a bunch of stuff like that and keywords as well, which is also important.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:58.980
So all those meta tags you have to put in there because not just it works for Twitter, but it

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:02.480
works for your search engine and as part of the rankings.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.420
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.880
And it definitely helps your stuff look more professional and anybody happens to grab it

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.060
and share it on social, right?

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:13.160
It's got this cool visual, like you've structured how it looks rather than just depending on like

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.820
a weird truncated URL.

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:15.640
Yeah, exactly.

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:23.380
And along the same lines, there's actually a whole other standard called JSON-LD, which is

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:30.800
used to essentially provide a JSON version of the stuff in your website, in your page.

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:41.240
So for example, when you go to Tri-Set Pass, in the main index, I can say, I am a website

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:46.240
of articles and here are all the articles and the titles and links and all that stuff.

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:46.660
Oh, wow.

00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:47.000
Okay.

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.060
So that's parsed by search engines.

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.600
But not just that.

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:55.380
That information is actually used to generate the little cards that show up in the Google

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:55.860
searches.

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:59.080
You know, if you search for a recipe, it'll sometimes have the little...

00:57:59.080 --> 00:57:59.180
Right, right, right.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:04.820
All of that stuff has higher priority than the rest of the content because it shows up

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.380
up top in your search results, right?

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.600
And that is actually used if you go to the Google Search Console.

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:15.520
There's a little discovery section on the left side, which is part of like if you're on an

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:21.520
Android device and it's one of the Google built-in things in there and it shows content that Google

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:27.240
thinks you'd be interested in, if you have these things available, then it shows up in

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.640
discovery a little bit more.

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.080
Oh, cool.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.740
You can characterize your website with it.

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.400
You can say it's articles, it's recipes, it's video or whatever.

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.920
There's like all this stuff to help do that.

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.320
Okay.

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.180
Awesome.

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:38.600
Yeah.

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.220
So that's JSON-LD, huh?

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.560
That was a piece that's important.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:42.660
JSON-LD.

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:43.160
Yeah.

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.360
I'll put that in the show notes as well so people can have that.

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:46.280
Oh, man.

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.160
So many things.

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:47.780
It's so awesome.

00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:52.100
And the thing is, it's rewarding if you get this right, people just engage with you and

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.080
your content more or your products or whatever.

00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.300
And it's awesome.

00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:55.580
Yep.

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:56.460
Exactly.

00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:57.140
All right, Chris.

00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:57.440
Cool.

00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:57.960
I should leave it here.

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:02.120
But maybe it'll have to be a second edition to dive deeper into this.

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:05.520
But before you get out of here, you got to answer the two questions again.

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:06.180
You're right.

00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:06.880
Some Python code.

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:07.860
What editor do you use?

00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:09.140
I'm on VS Code these days.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:10.800
Loving the remote extension.

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.500
Oh, yeah.

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.320
That's super cool.

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:14.620
I wanted to start using that as well some more.

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:15.300
I probably will.

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:16.720
I was talking about redoing my servers.

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.080
Maybe it's the time to get like a little hook for that in there as well.

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:19.940
Yeah.

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.160
And then notable PyPI package.

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.780
I'm using unsync these days a little bit.

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:25.840
I know you like that one.

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.120
I'm all about unsync.

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:27.640
I love that.

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.140
It's like awesomeness per line of Python code.

00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.120
Can't be beat.

00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:31.420
Yep.

00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:32.600
It's a really nice one.

00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:32.980
Awesome.

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:33.180
Yeah.

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:40.520
So basically, it's a unifying API across threaded parallelism, multiprocessing parallelism,

00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.620
and async ILO.

00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:42.280
Yep.

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.340
And a slightly better API for all of them.

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:44.880
Right.

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:45.300
And one.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:45.680
Yeah, exactly.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.140
It's so, so clean.

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:47.720
It's really nice.

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:48.200
I love it.

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:48.680
Really simple.

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.360
Great recommendation.

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:49.680
Yeah.

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.180
All right.

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:50.980
Final call to action.

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.020
People want to, like, they've got their site.

00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:56.500
Maybe they just threw it into PageSpeed and they're like, how could it be 54?

00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.620
This is, I can't believe it's 54.

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:02.240
Or, you know, they saw something crazy in the search console.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.240
They want to take some action, make this better, get their stuff to rank better.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:05.680
What do they do?

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.500
If you're using PageSpeed, just take advantage of the actual output.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.440
It's really descriptive.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.820
There's links to all the documentation, why all of the things matter.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.100
Just, like, take your time and go through it and start optimizing.

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:21.820
You'll probably be able to get a bunch out of just optimizing images first.

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.600
So you can prioritize stuff like that.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.700
Then you can head over to the JavaScript stuff.

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.580
And then you can start looking at the connections and whatnot.

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:34.960
I think reading through the Moz guide, which is a long guide, we'll link in the show notes,

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.980
is very useful.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.920
Remember, producing a good website not only makes more people come to it,

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.640
though, you know, people will be happier with it.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.960
It'll seem responsive and more professional, right?

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:46.420
I agree.

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.180
Yeah, all these things help SEO, but most of them also help the users directly.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.060
Yeah, that's right.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:51.340
Awesome.

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:52.880
Happy users is a good thing.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.840
That's for sure.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.160
All right.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.180
Well, Chris, it's been great to have you back on the show.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.340
Until next time.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:58.100
Thanks for having me.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:58.600
Yeah, you bet.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:58.900
Bye-bye.

01:00:58.900 --> 01:00:59.520
Catch you later.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.020
Bye.

I really appreciate it.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.220
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:34.880
I really appreciate it.
