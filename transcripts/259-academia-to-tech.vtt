00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.660
Did you come to Python from the academic side of the world? Maybe you got into working with code for

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.540
research or lab work and you found that you like coding more than your first field of study.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.360
Whatever the reason, many people make the transition from the academic world over to

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.780
tech and industry. On this episode, you'll meet three women who have made this transition and

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.440
you'll hear their stories. I'm excited to speak with Jennifer Stark, Kaylee Haynes, and Esleen

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.680
Becamu about their journey into the tech field. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 259, recorded

Kaylee, Esleen, Jennifer, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.700
Thank you very much for asking me.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.580
Thank you very much for having us. Thank you.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.700
It's really great to have you all here. I was in a PhD program. My wife is a professor. So I've,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.460
I spent a lot of time in the academic world. And I saw that you all were participating in this,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.320
I think at the time was going to be a live event around sort of sharing stories going from academia

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.460
into more of the tech side of the world. And I thought, oh, what a fun topic. I have to reach out

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.460
to you and have you all on the show. So I'm happy you're here.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.980
It's great. Great. Thanks for reaching out.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.780
Yeah, absolutely. It's a really interesting story how people spend so much time working on,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.960
you know, getting a PhD or getting some academic position. And it's just, I find the whole academic

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.620
space is really different than the tech space. And just to give folks a sense, you know, like the story

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.760
for my wife, if she wants to change jobs, like there's only a certain time of the year that jobs are kind of offered,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.480
right? Like interviews are done in January and you apply to them and there's like 30 or 40 in like a very specific

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.180
area in the world. And it's just such a different world than the tech space. But at the same time, college campuses

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.920
are beautiful places. Like the energy is just, I love being on campuses and whatnot. So it's, it's just such a trade-off to make,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.760
I think. So I'm really interested to dig into that with you. But before we get specifically to that,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.060
I want to start with your story. How do you get into programming in Python? Jennifer, you go first.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.700
Yeah, well, it's by accident. So I was working in the US at the time in Baltimore for the NIH. And it was

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:56.540
during the recession, I guess, so 2009, 2010. So the funding was frozen for a number of years. So we had to cut

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.640
back what we were like the fancy, not it wasn't even that fancy, but software we're using and use

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.500
open source software. So we started with R. So I learned R.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.880
Okay, nice. And what were you using before? Was it like MATLAB or SAS or something like that?

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.920
Yeah, some MATLAB and some other statistical programs that were made. But actually there were some of those

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.180
were also open source, specifically for the kind of data that we're analyzing.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.240
And this I'm guessing is in the health and medical research area if you're at NIH?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.820
Yes, it was NIDA, so National Institute for Drug Abuse.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.060
Yeah, so you learned R. And then somehow you got from R. Are you doing R only? Are you doing R in Python now?

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.140
Currently, I've not used R for a really long time. I moved over to Python because the kinds of things I wanted to do

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.180
broadened and Python's good for so many things. So it just seemed like a natural step for me.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.100
Yeah, I think that's a trade-off a lot of people have to make between R and Python. I feel like R

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.980
is very specialized and it's very powerful, but then Python allows you to say like,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.920
I have these same skills. Oh, and I could go build this web app or I could go build this other thing

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.460
that is not actually just about visualizing and processing data.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:08.200
Yeah. I mean, I think the last R package I used was for looking at diffusion. And the only place you

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.820
could find that could allow you to do cartotic diffusion was an R package. So that's how

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.300
specialist it is. It's amazing.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.760
Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Very cool. Aislinn?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.740
Yeah. So I started, I think, well, I learned Python when I was in my second year as an undergrad.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.500
So in my first year, I was using MATLAB and my second year, I was introduced to Python.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:41.060
So yeah, I was studying maths. So yeah, I did a degree in maths and I just fell in love with Python.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.340
So yeah, since then I've just been using Python, but yeah, it was good.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.520
Yeah. Yeah. Very good. And I also was working on in math for a long time and

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.360
it's a fun world, but I got to say, I like programming better.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.200
Kayleigh, how about you?

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.680
Yes. I went to university to study physics and then after a few months, I realized I didn't

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.400
really like physics. So I moved into a maths and statistics degree. So I've got the statistics

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.060
background. So I've come from R. So I think I must've learned R about my third or fourth year

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.700
undergrad. And then from that, I then decided to go and do a master's and then a PhD in statistics.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.800
I sort of got quite a strong R background. And just recently, I guess I'm trying to learn

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.800
Python, but very, very like beginner level. And I guess that means Jennifer sort of knew

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.120
each other through like PyData and R Manchester.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.500
Nice. And I guess it's worth mentioning that you all come from the same town, Manchester in

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.560
the UK. So you, you could actually see each other at meetups and whatnot, right? Not just

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.520
necessarily online.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.240
In the old days.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.560
Yeah, that's super cool.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.180
Yeah. We're all in Manchester now, but we're not all, none of us are from Manchester, I don't

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.360
think.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.680
No.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.700
Well, and you know, I mean, we'll get into it later in the show a little bit, maybe,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.880
but the idea of getting together and seeing each other right now is kind of, you could

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.040
be on the other side of the world. It's, it's still a weird time. So yeah. Well, I guess,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.200
you know, I hear a little bit of your story and how you got into these, these various areas,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:14.260
but what got you interested in sort of computational side of, of computers and programming and whatnot?

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.580
I mean, Kaylee, go in reverse order, I guess. So if you're not into physics and you want to

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.380
switch into math, like when I was in math, it was pen, paper, chalk, chalkboard, right? Like

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.480
let there be a theorem. I did end up doing a bunch of cool, like visualization work and stuff

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.660
near the end, but it definitely didn't start out that way. It started out with, okay, we've got,

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.260
you know, seven axioms in a corollary and you've got an hour to come up with something.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.080
Right. Right. So what got you sort of going down that path?

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.380
So I think the reason I changed from physics to maths was I didn't really like

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.880
the practical lectures at the time that I was being taught when I went to university,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.700
which is sort of interesting now because I'm more interested in the practical side. But I think

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:02.180
first year physics, when I went to uni was very basic and very boring. And I remember I always like

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.780
back to the same lab that we had where we just had to swing a pendulum for an hour. And I'm sure that's

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.020
interesting to some people, but it just really didn't interest me at all. So then I had moved

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.500
into maths and statistics. I just had this really great lecturer in statistics in first year who was

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.040
so enthusiastic about data, which I think that sort of helped seeing someone else be so enthusiastic

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.680
about it. So then I decided that statistics was the degree that I was going to do. And I think,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.960
is it like my third to fourth year? So we do four year undergrads up in Scotland. So I think in

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.580
between the summer of my third and fourth year, I then decided to go do an internship at Lancaster

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.420
University. And there's a really good doctorate training centre on statistics and operational

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.500
research. And that was really interesting. It was sort of like an eight week programme,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.220
where you got given a stats project to do. And it gave you an insight into doing a PhD.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:56.920
And the doctorate training centre at Lancaster is sort of built up and geared towards giving you an

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.900
insight to doing statistics, but in industry. So it gave us a real like practical sort of use to our

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:10.420
data. So as you said, like a lot of maths was like theorems and just different like feature species and

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.260
geometry, which was all about abstracts and something that I can't really like bring my mind to visualising.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.520
Whereas I'm more of a, I like to see the data and insights and see plots and visualisations.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.760
Yeah, I think having some kind of concrete project like that, just, it completely changes

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.380
how you experience it, right?

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.560
Yeah, definitely. And it's sort of, you can then see like actionable insights and you can see the point.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.000
Whereas I feel like going down a more theoretical maths route, it's quite difficult to see.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.580
Well, for me anyway, like what's actually going to be the point of this at the end?

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:45.740
You know, it's a little bit how I felt as well. Like I felt like it was okay. Now at some point you just start

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.980
solving these abstract problems for the sake of, well, they've solved them up to here. So the next logical

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.760
problem someone's got to solve is to keep pushing it. But it's like, well, I'm not really sure what this is

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:00.480
contributing back to the world compared to so many other things that you could do, for example, like healthcare

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.100
or something. So yeah, that was sort of my thought as well. Esleen, how about you?

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:14.420
So I, when I did my degree in maths, I did pure maths. So that was even more abstract, but I quite

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:21.080
enjoy it. I really enjoyed it. And it's only, so after my degree, I didn't know what to do. So I wanted

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:26.480
to get into accountancy. So at the time I wasn't thinking about big data or anything like that. So I

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:33.860
had a conversation with my family, a project supervisor. So can I mention his name? He means a lot to me.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:42.100
James, Dr. James Burridge. So we had, we had a conversation about what I wanted to do after I

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.340
graduated. So I told him about getting into an accountancy firm. And he said, have you considered

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.520
about, you know, doing a PhD? So I thought in my head, I was thinking, oh my God.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:01.020
But I did say yes, I did say yes, because I really enjoyed, I really enjoyed doing my degree in maths,

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:07.300
especially my final year project. I loved it. I really enjoyed it. So I did say yes. So in 2015,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:15.500
I went back to the same university. So the University of Portsmouth, and then I did my PhD. Now my PhD was in

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.420
applied maths. So that was applicable.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:49.760
That's a big switch. Yeah. And that's when I realized how important maths is in a way, and how many problems you can solve with maths. We in my PhD, we actually came up with a model. So we derived the model from scratch, and we're able to implement the model in Python, and then get some data and then analyze the data. So we just became so real and so much interested. So yeah, I mean, that's when I found it.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:11:19.740
I love with like data. And yeah, even more maths. Yeah, absolutely. And the really interesting thing that I hear from both of you is like, there was this one professor who made such an impression. And I would say the same reason I went and spent a lot of time studying what I did was, there was, I think it was like a Calc three class or something like that. And it was just such a great person I connected with, and encouraged me to go down that path. And you know, I see in my daughters who are in their second year, going to be in their second year,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:41.740
college. Same thing. There was one teacher in high school that was just such made such an impression, they're both doing their thing. And it's, it's, it's amazing how these small interactions can have such huge effects. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, Jennifer, how about you? The question is how I got on to how did you get into like, working with data and like sort of computational programming side of things?

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:55.900
Just the nature of the PhD, I did actually, so undergrad never had anything, particularly complicated, just regular biology type, statistics, like t tests.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:08.380
Yeah, very, very, very, yeah, exactly. Very few. Yeah, just, just enough to like, like do the lab work, right? Yeah. Very few people, I think, go into biology thinking, I'm going to be a biology programmer type person, right? No way, yeah.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.740
But it's somehow it seems to like, draw you in, right? Totally accidental. Yeah.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:35.380
Yeah, okay. Went from t tests and an overs on, you know, a couple of subjects to, to doing well, so my PhD was looking at appetite systems. And it was a PhD that was the first, it was in Manchester as a first day, first time they'd had two different departments collaborate on a PhD.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:13:03.380
So it was between a traditional biology wet lab, which I was comfortable in, and the neuroimaging lab. So we were doing MRI studies to look at appetite systems. And of course, MRI, you've got three dimensional data sets. And if you take a brain image every three seconds, then you've got four dimensional data. And that requires a very different analytic approach.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:09.320
Yeah, that's very different than taking measurements in a lab or growing something in a Petri dish or something.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:30.700
Very, very different. And then you're in the world of signal processing, which wasn't what I was expecting. So now you've got to deal with drift of the signal over time. And then there's so many different ways to pre process signal, signal data that or time course data that not everyone agrees on how it should be analyzed. So that's fun as well.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:53.440
So yeah, at the time, there's several university developed software that's specifically designed for MRI. And so that makes it open source, because it's designed, it's created with public money. There's three main software tools available. And then usually like user interface, you know, you sort of click and, and build up your process that way.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:10.560
But they're also developed in a way that you can you can code it instead, you can write a bash script that will then link all the different steps together. And then you can do batch style analysis. So I guess that was my first entry into that kind of analysis using bash scripts, and which was terrifying at the time.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:18.380
Yeah, you're probably thinking, how did I get here? Like, this is not what I signed up for. I didn't. What happened? Huh?

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.700
Yeah, but it drew me in, like you say, as I got into it.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:36.100
Yeah, I think I mean, that's my theory about a lot of these things is people don't go into the data science side of this and that, you know, the data science Python tools necessarily, because they start out with the plan to be a data science programmer type.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:42.200
Like, they just have they're, they're doing work just like you described. And they're like, well, I, I've got to figure a little bit of this out.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:54.360
Because otherwise, it's untenable, or it'll be, you know, 10 times more effective or whatever. And then a little bit more and a little bit more than you look back and like, wait a minute, I've been programming all week. And that's all I've done. Like, how did this happen? How did I get here? Right?

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.000
Yeah, it's brilliant.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:26.540

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:40.760
I think it's going to be interesting, though, in like the next generation of data scientists, because I think we've all come from a background where data science wasn't a thing a few years ago.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:53.560
Like, I only ever heard of data science when I was like finishing off like my PhD, probably in the last like year or two, where I was then looking for a career and starting to see like my peers a couple of years above me, starting to apply for data science roles.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.720
Whereas now, there's more data science courses.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:10.520
And I think I say you're going to then get a different breed of data scientists who have gone into it wanting to be a data scientist, not necessarily come into it from a different background thinking, oh, wait, I've been doing MRIs and data processing, thinking processing, and now I'm a data scientist.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.240
I think that's so interesting. Yeah, go ahead.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:18.500
Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, a few years ago, when I was doing my degree, I didn't know nothing about data science.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.500
I think it's a new, it's quite new, and it is sort of improving.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.060
There are new tools constantly being built.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:30.940
So it's very, I think it's an interesting area.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:38.220
So I think for anyone joining into the data world, they're realizing that there's so much to learn and to do.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:42.560
And it's just like finding out what you can do with the data.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.780
It's not, it's enjoyable.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.140
Yeah, it's, yeah, it's really interesting.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:55.580
I don't think that for very long, there's been, I don't know how many data science programs there are, where they say, here's a data science university program.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.800
I don't even know if they've been around long enough for people to graduate from them yet.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.040
I think there are some master's programs at the moment.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.000
So one, one year master's programs.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.700
Yeah. So if they're one year people probably, or there's probably some graduates, but certainly 10 years ago, I don't think, I think it was that way.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.100
So it's a really good point that when you kind of look out and you say, well, what can I do?

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.680
You look at the degrees that you can go get and then what those kind of lead onto.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:26.560
And you're right that now I definitely think there's people that are like, oh, this AI stuff is really interesting.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.500
Machine learning is interesting.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.240
The visualization is great.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:38.580
And when I was studying math, the choices for what you could officially do with your math degree were extremely limited.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:45.720
It was, let's see, you could go into, you could be, what's the analysis for life insurance?

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.700
But actuary.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.000
Actuary. Yeah, actuary.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.720
Or you could go into like Wall Street or you could be a professor or a teacher.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.920
And that was it, right?

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.580
And I think that probably is happening across all these different areas.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.420
It's probably happening in biology and it's happening in economics and so on.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:08.660
And I feel like it probably this side of the world has opened up new paths for all those different focuses as well.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.540
What do you all think?

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.020
Yeah, definitely.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.560
I think as well it's good though because it means that like we get quite a mix of backgrounds.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.380
So you do get the people that are now data science coming from a physics degree, biology degree.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.180
So I work at a company called Peak where we've got a team of about 25 data scientists.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:29.480
And everyone's come from all these different backgrounds and it's really great to get sort of like the different expertise.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.840
Some people have different ways of like visualizing things.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.440
Some people have come from more computer science type degrees.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.680
I think that's my point I made a bit earlier.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.920
It's like if you're then going to just get students that are going to go straight into data science,

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.520
you sort of lose some of that background and the expertise of different areas coming together.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:47.860
Yeah.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.140
Yeah.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.680
It sounds like everyone agrees on that.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.520
You're all shaking your head.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.060
No one can see on the audio, but yeah.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.080
Yeah, for sure.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.840
And I think by working with people from different backgrounds, you get an opportunity to learn from them.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.080
And so I think it's great.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.840
Yeah, for sure.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.920
You touched on what you're doing now at Peak with 25 different data scientists.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.600
Let's dig into that for all of you.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.600
So maybe you could expand on that just a little bit.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.860
Like what kind of projects are you solving?

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.200
What general area are you working in and so on?

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.960
Yeah, so actually I'm a bit of a weird one at the moment.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.260
So I'm in my last two weeks of Peak because I'm moving companies in a couple of weeks' time.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:21.700
Okay.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.000
Yeah, maybe tell us what you have been doing and where are you going?

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.520
Or what your future holds?

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.960
So at Peak, we've got 25 data scientists.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:33.880
We're a company in Manchester, a startup-based company, who we sort of sell AI to businesses

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.320
that don't have the capabilities in-house to do data science and machine learning.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:45.100
We've got a wide spectrum of customers, ranging from like household retail brands to like manufacturing.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.800
So within the data science team with 25 offers, we've got two teams.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.980
We've got one team that focuses more on like customer AI.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.980
So customer AI is things like recommendation systems, churn analysis, lifetime value.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.500
And then the team that I sit in is in the demand AI side.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.520
So we do things like demand forecasting, inventory optimization, warehouse optimization.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.120
So a lot of projects I've been working on are things like forecasting.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.440
So my background in time series analysis.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:22.500
So I did a PhD in change point detection, which I think is quite relevant at this moment that we're now in a big change in life

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.720
and like being able to detect change points and be able to work with them.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.780
Just a plug there for change point detection.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.480
So yeah, so that's how I sort of come into this team.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.680
A recent project I've been working on has been more in like warehouse optimization.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:41.900
So we've got a retailer that are trying to optimize how they pick their clothing orders around the warehouse

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:48.260
and trying to like come up with like the most efficient ways to walk around the warehouse to pick things up as quick as possible.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.920
So that's what I've been working on at Peak.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.340
I'm moving to a company called Residently in a couple of weeks time,

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.980
who are another Manchester best startup,

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.220
but they're more in, they do like sort of property technologies at PropTech.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.380
So they've got like rentals.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.120
So a bit like, I guess, Airbnb, but more sort of long-term rental space.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.240
Sure. Okay. Yeah.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.780
That sounds like a bunch of fun projects.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.860
Jennifer, how about you?

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.780
I'm now working at Ladbible, Ladbible Group.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.580
So they were born on a Facebook platform.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.980
Now it's a website and on Facebook and all the other social media you can imagine.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:21.460
Sure.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:25.620
So I'm the lead engineer, data engineer on that team, on the data team.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:26.980
There's only three of us.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:27.640
We're tiny.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.720
And current...

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.140
You know, some of those small groups though are so cool because you get to,

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.780
you don't get pigeonholed into a little tiny thing.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:41.260
You get to actually see and work in the whole system, all the software.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.860
And it's hugely valuable.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.740
It's a little stressful because like all of a sudden...

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:45.980
Yeah.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.080
Everyone wants something, which is great.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.200
It's a great problem to have.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:55.340
And yeah, I wanted to work in a small company so that I can be involved in all the things.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.200
Because I want to do all the things.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.460
Everything interests me.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.000
I always want to learn new stuff.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.940
And this afforded me the opportunity to do that.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.880
So yeah, there's just three of us.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.900
We're currently working on the new data warehouse using Google Cloud Platform.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.160
So we currently got a data warehouse, but it's...

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.000
We want to have a...

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.380
GCP can be more scalable and more robust.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.660
It's got great monitoring.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.340
And the dev team uses GCP as well.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.560
So it's good to be on the same stack.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:22.840
Yeah.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.260
Nice.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:23.560
Yeah.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.700
Also, it's got...

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.020
You can use Python with it.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:26.520
So that's good.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.060
Yeah.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.200
So we've got big plans for that.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.080
Currently building out the data warehouse so that we can then carry out our big plans later.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.560
Yeah.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:32.860
Cool.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.120
The Lad Bible.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.300
This is like...

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.600
It looks like sort of a new take on news in the social media landscape.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.460
Something like that.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.480
Is that roughly right?

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.180
Yeah.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:42.900
Yeah.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.500
It's more lighthearted news, I suppose.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.040
Yeah.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.080
Spreading positive attitudes, which is really great.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.320
Like I really like working for them.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.720
The teams are amazing.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.060
So great to work with.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:54.620
Yeah.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:54.940
Yeah.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.600
It sounds really fun.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.480
It's definitely something that we could use.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.780
Esleen, how about you?

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.580
So I also work for a startup company in Manchester.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.700
It's called Agent Software Limited.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:14.300
We aim to revolutionize the way estate agents across the UK market their services using targeted

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.800
prospective material.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:22.280
We've seen that agents have sort of seen sensational results with a fraction of marketing outlay.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.540
I work in the data team.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.220
So I work as a data scientist.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.140
I joined as a junior data engineer.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:36.780
I'm still learning about engineering and I have a great manager and a great boss.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.160
He hates when I call him boss.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.300
I can't confirm.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.000
He's brilliant.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.280
He used to be my boss.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:41.760
Yeah.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.460
Nice.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.100
Yeah.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:49.060
So, yeah, we work on some interest, but great projects.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:49.560
We work.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:56.520
So, for example, the project we worked on about two weeks ago, we estimated the value of a

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:56.900
property.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.660
So any properties in the UK.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:06.920
So we sort of started a model to get the estimated value of any property in the UK, which I think

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.360
is great.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.220
And the one we're working on the moment is the propensity to sell.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:15.220
So that's the project we're working on the moment.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:22.120
I think at the moment, well, I've got some features that we both agree to use.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.580
So it is great.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:29.060
I'm enjoying working as a data scientist, especially within the company, because, you know, there

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.680
are some amazing people and I get along with them.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.900
So it just makes life easier.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.220
That's really great.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:36.800
It's interesting.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.200
I hear you all talking about all these people that you're working with, how great it is.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:45.720
And people who are coming in, maybe they're in academics or something, but they're not in

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.420
the programming side.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:50.840
Maybe they think of the programming world as, you know, you sit in a dark room by yourself

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.820
and write code.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.740
And it doesn't sound like that's your experience.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.240
No.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.800
That would be great.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.340
I wouldn't be against that.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:09.000
There's a lot of people management and not like managing a team, but talking to stakeholders,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.040
managing expectations.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:10.680
Yeah.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:16.200
A lot of times you're the person between the people who want the software and maybe the

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.840
customers or who's using it.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.000
And you've kind of got to juggle all that, like that project management sort of side, right?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.260
Like, what are we going to focus on?

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.780
What are we going to build for them?

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.420
And so on.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:25.840
Yeah.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.640
Well, I mean, in our team anyway, we've got a project manager and he's brilliant at helping

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.560
to protect us from that and making sure our priorities are aligned with that other business.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.600
I sort of code maybe half the time.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.900
And the rest of that's sort of planning and coordinating and meeting and discussing discussions

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.220
with people, trying to figure out what they need, what we can do to make things better.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.940
And, you know, all that kind of thing.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:48.300
It's good.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:48.640
Yeah.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.000
That's cool.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:49.960
How about you others?

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.900
Same time balance about it?

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.520
Or how is it?

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.560
I think at the moment I do more coding.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.320
So I was team lead until last summer.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:03.840
So I had like a lot of time just spent like managing a team and setting them tasks, making

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.300
sure everyone like was okay with the customer work and sort of was that sort of in between

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.180
sort of firefighting type role.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.320
But then I took a decision that I actually wanted to spend more time learning and developing.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.420
That's where sort of my Python development came up.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.880
So I was like, I just want to take a bit of time away from the team lead role and actually

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.740
spend time coding.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.660
I think from doing that, I've actually managed to carve quite a lot of my time just to focus

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.140
on the coding side of things and actually developing the models and doing analytics.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:34.420
And then we have a customer success team that's sort of the link between our customers and the

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.040
data scientists.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:41.040
So they can do a lot more of the like customer engagement and making sure that the customers

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.620
are happy and sort of communicating what we're doing for them.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.000
And we get a bit more time to actually focus on doing data science, which is really cool.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.840
Yeah, that's great.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.260
Esleen?

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.220
I think at the moment I'm doing more research just for the more, because we want to build

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.140
a model for the propensity to sell.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:59.260
I'm doing more research, but at the same time, but doing research gives me sort of an opportunity

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.960
to learn new techniques and new tools.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:06.560
So yeah, I'm not coding at the moment, but I am missing it.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.640
Yeah.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:13.700
Well, one thing I think is worth talking about maybe is all of your backgrounds were not officially

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.800
in computer science from the beginning, you know, freshman year and university.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.320
And neither was mine.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.960
And that means when you get into the industry, it's a lot of like what you described.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.580
It's a lot of research, a lot of figuring out like, oh, I know this, but now they're asking

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.340
me to do this other thing.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.260
I have no experience.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.500
Like I have no idea how to talk to a database, but apparently this is what I'm figuring out

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:35.760
soon.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.000
Right.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.240
Like that kind of path.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:44.380
Do you think that your academic backgrounds and just the whole sort of advanced study side

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.080
of things just kept going when you got into the tech industry?

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.200
And was it helpful?

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.100
Yeah, Jennifer?

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:49.840
Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.900
I think, so I don't know what people imagine on the whole when they think about what's

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.720
different between academia and industry, but there's a lot of transferable skills between

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.160
PhD and industry.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:05.060
So planning experiments or planning projects, that's the same research.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.260
So like when you go into a new project, you've got to do the research to figure out like what's

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.360
been done before, what hasn't been done yet.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.280
So how could you go about testing something or learning something?

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.300
That's the same, which as in just described.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.700
And yeah, you come up with, you're giving you tasks and like, well, I've not actually

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.580
done that before.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.180
Like I've not done recommendation systems before.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:22.940
I've got to figure that out.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.160
You're still mentoring.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.880
So the higher up you go in academia, you start mentoring students.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.640
You do the same in an industry.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.140
Maybe you're a TA teaching a class while you're doing your research or something like that.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:32.520
Yeah, exactly.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:32.840
Yeah.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:38.280
And you're mentoring junior or foundation level data scientists or whoever, when you get

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:42.980
into industry, you're always learning using your reasoning skills really to get through

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.480
any of the work that you do.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.100
It's the same in academia as it is industry.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.100
There's a lot of overlap between the two.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.660
I think definitely my sort of academic background has taught me to be sort of curious and to

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:57.300
keep asking questions when I'm doing tech, especially it's quite easy as a scientist, I think, to

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:03.400
sort of get your data, run it through some sort of like scikit-learn type model, get the

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:03.540
result.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:03.960
Here's the answer.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.700
And then just go with it.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.820
And I think it's, I think what a PhD has sort of developed is that sort of deeper thinking

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.100
of, but why is that the answer?

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.500
Can I explain that?

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.320
What happens if I change something?

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.720
And I think I've like interviewed quite a lot of data scientists over the past couple of years.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.560
And you notice more sort of the ones that have come more from a junior level that have maybe

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:29.480
just come out of a master's haven't quite developed that sort of questioning because it's sort of

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:35.000
what comes from doing a PhD and diving into much more deeper analysis on things that they're

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.220
sort of just to get the results.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.760
But then when you sort of dig into like the question and say, why is that the answer?

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.240
How did the model perform?

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.720
How does it work?

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.460
They're sort of as unsure about that.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:50.180
And I think that's something that I've sort of been trained to sort of keep questioning during

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.220
my PhD, which I then brought to tech.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:52.740
Oh yeah, super.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.240
Esley?

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.820
Yeah, I think it's the same for me.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:30:00.820
I think my PhD has really helped me to think things through and to question myself and to

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:06.060
check, to double check and check again and to test my work really.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:13.640
Whether I implement it in Python or even doing some analysis, I just, it's, I think it's,

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.620
it's really helped me in that way.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:22.540
Because I think when I did my PhD, one thing I learned was just because you have some, you've

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.000
done some mathematical analysis doesn't mean it's totally right.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.900
It's good to prove it by doing some programming as well.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.140
You know, it's much more, you know, it just makes it a lot more fun.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.800
And also you're able to show what you've proved mathematically.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:42.000
You're able to show it as a graph, for example, you can, so people can actually visualize the

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.620
maths behind it.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:47.100
Even if they don't quite understand the maths, as soon as they see graphs that they get a

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:52.340
bit happy because yeah, that's something I'm really grateful to have learned whilst doing

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:52.940
a PhD.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:53.760
Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:59.760
It does really make it much more concrete because maths can be so abstract and out there.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:05.000
And once you either make a program that can say, do a recommendation or it can generate a picture,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.460
all of a sudden it's like, oh, look, it's, it's kind of real.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.620
It, it sort of exists at least visually.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:09.960
Yeah.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.360
Yeah.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.460
So, all right.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.720
So here's like one of the big questions I think of this conversation.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:21.200
You all talked about your, your background and academics and studying and so on.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:29.560
And you're all working in the tech industry, not doing biology or statistics or complex analysis

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.680
or whatever, you know, it is in the math world that you thought you might've been doing.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.340
So what was the thinking there?

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:40.340
I could tell you when I sort of dropped out of my PhD program, which I did halfway through,

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.500
it was a big decision and it like kind of weighed on me for a while.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.140
It doesn't anymore.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.860
I'm, I'm all great with it, but best decision ever.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.920
But you know, what was your thinking?

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.000
You know, whoever wants to jump in first, go for it.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.860
I think I always sort of knew that I would probably end up in industry, particularly

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.400
like sort of halfway through my PhD.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:04.260
So because the way our doctorate training center was sort of set up, it was set up to work with

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.100
industrial partners.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:10.320
So we had a lot of our PhD projects were with industrial funding.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:17.200
So I did mine with a company, DSTL, which is the Fern Science and Technology Laboratory.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:24.440
And like within my PhD cohort, there was 10 people in my year and everyone sort of had a different industrial partner.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:28.580
And within that, they would, the industrial partners would come and present to us.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.800
We would have like regular problem solving days where they would come in in the morning.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.620
It's sort of like a mini hackathon where we'd get to work on practical problems.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.280
That sounds so cool.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.700
I think really useful, right?

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.300
Not just like you're going to study the theory and then you're on your own.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:42.840
That's great.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.120
Yeah.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.380
So it was like a really applied PhD.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:57.680
So even though we were spending time researching and doing our own work, the doctorate training center also put on all these other events and sort of things like conferences where there'd be half academic speakers and half industrial speakers.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:07.880
And I think I was always more interested to go to the industrial talks so that people like using tech in the industry because they're more applied.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.940
I could see the reasons behind doing them.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:18.920
I think academia, you spend a long time sort of trying to develop novel areas and trying to prove them like asymptotically or whatever.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:25.600
Whereas I think I was much more of a, I know the tool set or I'd like to go and research what tool set to use and then apply it.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.920
So I think it was always sort of more than the applied sort of side.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.140
Yeah.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.120
That's a big difference, right?

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:35.280
You don't get credit for just necessarily finding interesting uses of existing technology and academics.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.120
It's always about what new problem are you, what new question are you answering, right?

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.720
So that's a big difference.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.040
Yeah.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:48.820
And I feel like it's always very small incremental changes that you might make and someone's done it that like there's like years and years of research and you might be changing.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.600
I'm not doing a parameter or doing something quite small.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:56.380
I also think that academia is a bit sort of outdated in a sense.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.320
So it's a bit slow.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:07.120
So like the time you publish papers and then it goes through like all your reviewers and then you do all your edits and then you eventually get your publication like submitted and published.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.160
That could have taken like two years.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:20.680
Whereas in the industry, you could have your project in sort of developed like productionized thing ready in a few months and then value generated from it.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:20.860
Yeah.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.740
It's a huge difference.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:22.500
Yeah, for sure.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:22.900
Esaleen.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.760
Well, when I finished my PhD, I didn't.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:32.460
Well, just before I finished, I didn't know what to do because I enjoyed working in academia.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.260
I was working whilst doing my PhD.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:39.820
I was also helping undergrad students with their maths problems.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.760
So I enjoyed talking to people, explaining and just interacting with students.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.920
I really enjoyed it.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:54.120
So when I finished my PhD, I applied in academia and I also applied in the tech industry.

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:59.080
So I just said to myself, the first job that comes along is the one that I'll go for.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.860
So I first worked as a Python developer.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.280
I think that was really good.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:15.080
I worked for a year and that was a great opportunity for me to really improve my Python skills because I was using Python on a daily basis.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.140
But I was missing my maths because it was made.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.600
Yeah, sure.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.920
So I really missed it.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.840
So, yeah, that's why I started applying for data scientist roles and I did get one.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:31.480
But I think for me, I enjoyed, I mean, I am in tech industry and I really enjoy what I'm doing.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:38.760
I feel like I'm doing everything I've always wanted to do because I do enjoy programming and I also enjoy maths.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.160
So having both just makes me happy.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:46.180
At the same time, in terms of interaction, I do interact with my peers.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.060
So I'm not really missing out.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.200
But yeah, before I finished my PhD, I didn't know what I wanted to do.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:36:00.940
Mainly because I was wondering whether the level of interaction in an industry will be different to actually lecturing.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:04.260
But now that I do know, it's not really different.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:04.860
Yeah.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:12.840
One of the things I thought I would miss the most, that I thought I was giving up, was that teaching side of things.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:21.280
Because I was teaching, in grad school, I was teaching all the levels of calculus and linear algebra and those types of things.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:26.160
And I really enjoyed that probably more than actually studying math directly.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.900
And I thought, okay, well, if I'm going to programming, I'm definitely giving that up.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.420
And that seemed like a huge thing.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:36.260
And then it turned out that I ended up doing professional development training stuff later on.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.860
And I kind of got it back anyway.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.700
It's not as big of a trade-off, I guess.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.560

Go to linode.com slash careers to find out more.

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.760
Let them know that we sent you.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.820
Jennifer, how did you...

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:47.860
It sounded like you were working a little more close to where your degree was,

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.400
you know, when you said working in Baltimore and so on,

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.360
before you moved over to what you're doing now.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:53.720
Yeah.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:38:00.020
So I did six years postdoc after my PhD, and that was just more MRI.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:00.600
It was brilliant.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.680
That's how I got into coding.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.120
And I liked...

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.340
I really liked...

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:08.800
So yeah, it's still academia, but in, I guess, the government research space.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.060
Yeah.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.020
So it's still not industry.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.440
But yeah, the analysis was great.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.920
Experiments, brilliant.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.040
Like, loved all that stuff.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.040
But I'd always be attracted to the sparkly new technology.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.380
Like, there's this new technique.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.540
And I'd think, oh, I want to do that.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.240
But it's like, no, no, no, that doesn't answer this.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.200
You got to...

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.200
It's the question first.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.080
And then you pick the right approach.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.120
And that's still true, even in data science industry.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.320
But it's a little bit easier to handle now.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.880
Also, I'm aware of it now.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.220
So I know when to stop myself.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:36.840
But yeah, projects were really long.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:41.560
So one experiment from beginning to end of potentially having finished the paper would

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.700
be like 18 months, really long experiments.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.580
So I don't have a very long attention span.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.620
So that's not great for me.

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:52.480
Also, once I've done the experiment, I've got the answer that I was looking for.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.760
But then you've got to write out the paper.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.260
But I'm interested in something else now.

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.480
You're kind of done with it.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.760
But there's all this work you've got to go through and peer review and revise and resubmit,

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.180
all that.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:06.640
You've got to write introductions and stuff and justify what I did.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.300
And yeah, it's a really long process.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.500
And yeah, I want to do the next thing by then.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.900
Also, there's not really much feedback.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.320
You know, you submit the paper and it's so niche.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.800
And then you get nothing back.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.740
Like what did what I do change anything?

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:22.760
Did it progress anything?

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.480
You might get some references or citations later.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.640
But it'll be, you know, a year or two, you might get five citations.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.300
And I would just, did that mean anything?

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.040
And those citations might not even be positive about your paper.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.940
They might be saying this paper, this experiment was bad.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:36.680
And we're going to do it differently.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.160
We're trying to just prove it.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.720
So it's very unhappy all around.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:45.720
So I didn't know going into industry would solve these problems at the time.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:50.340
But I feel like, at least in the companies I've worked for so far, they've both been very

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.080
small companies.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.820
The projects are much more shorter.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.080
They're more defined.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.380
They worked in smaller increments.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:00.680
You get feedback quicker and directly with the people that you're doing it for.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.700
So that's really cool.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.220
And there's no papers to write.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.020
Yeah.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:04.460
Yeah.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.560
I do think there's the opportunity to iterate.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.480
Y'all have touched on this, that you iterate on something.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:16.600
You can go from idea to making a difference or making an impact in a month or two instead

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.500
of, did you even make a difference?

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:23.240
The thing that really drove me crazy about the academic side was once you really get

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:28.680
to the point where you're doing official academic stuff, so much, so often it's extremely limited.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:33.860
You know, there's 20 people in the world who potentially could care and half of them don't.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:38.200
You know, it's pretty, it depends on the area, but it can be very, very small.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.220
I remember.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:44.040
And you can write software that isn't used by millions of people or makes huge differences.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.520
And it's a big contrast.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:51.040
And also like in industry or like in programming, there's a lot more like open source.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.880
So you can get your function out there and people can use your function.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.920
Whereas it can be quite difficult to actually access papers.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.740
So even if you then publish a paper in the journal, unless you also work in academia, you

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:07.640
can't really access papers unless you pay lots of money or find someone that can access it

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.040
for you.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.820
Does that seem crazy to you that so much of this research is government funded, publicly funded,

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.520
but is locked up behind these extremely expensive journals?

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:15.920
Yes.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:16.680
Drives me nuts.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:20.100
They get paid twice because you've got to pay to submit your paper and they've got to

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:20.720
pay to read it.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.460
And it's peer reviewed by academics who are doing it for free.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.340
Yes, exactly.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:24.940
It's ridiculous.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.740
People who work on it.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:30.460
I know some people in the journal get paid and do work, but the reviewers, the, yeah, it's

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.260
like part of their commitment to being an academic.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:32.600
Yeah.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:32.880
Yeah.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.140
I have feelings about that.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.580
Yeah.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.300
That's another episode.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:41.760
Interesting.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.440
So that's really interesting.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:49.860
You know, when I made the switch, it just seemed like a lot of what you were all saying really

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:50.620
was part of it.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.360
I felt like I wasn't going to make that big of an impact.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.200
I felt like what I was doing was actually much more interesting.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:04.520
I also thought the employment story was really challenging in the academic space for me.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:10.100
You know, just talking to the people who were graduating a year or two ahead of me, how many

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.140
applications they had.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.540
Like I applied for 105 positions.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:20.840
I got five responses, two interviews, and one postdoc offer for one year that I can reapply

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.080
for.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.140
Like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.580
This is like a good university.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.540
You got your PhD.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:30.100
There should be more than one offer in the entire realm of what you can apply for.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.640
So I'm just like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.680
This is a little bit crazy.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.340
So yeah, there's definitely a lot of benefits.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:42.420
One thing I do want to ask you all is what advice would you give back to people who are,

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.320
say, in academics now?

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.700
Not necessarily like, oh, you should move on because whatever, because there's a lot of good

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.020
stuff happening in academics as well.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:56.820
But what are some of the data science techniques or programming tips or career advice would you

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:01.740
give to people who are maybe getting their PhD or master's degree or something like that?

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:07.420
I think I'd say to try, if possible, to get a little bit of experience in working in industry.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:12.480
So whether that's trying to find like an internship or fellowship, I know some sort of PhD courses

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.740
or master's courses actually offer that, where you can take like three months, maybe sabbatical

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.880
from your PhD and go try doing something in industry.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:25.060
Or there's, I think in the UK, there's like KTPs, which are knowledge transfer partnerships.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:30.460
I guess there might be similar things over in the States, just to get that sort of experience

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:36.120
of trying both academia and research and industry, but also to speak to people in industry.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:41.580
Because I think there's like data science is such a wide spectrum of a career that there's

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.220
different parts to data science that might interest different people.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:50.520
And someone that's sort of spent a long time in academia and has possibly gone through and

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:54.980
done that few postdocs might find themselves wanting to go into more of a research post

00:43:54.980 --> 00:44:00.480
in industry where they could get sort of that hybrid of still doing research for a bit, but

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.700
doing it in industry, which would then give them sort of like a foot in the door.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:08.300
And then they might realize then that either they want to stay sort of more research or they

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.160
might think actually the apply time is quite fun.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:10.920
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.880
There's a lot of companies that have little research projects going on inside them.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.520
And you could definitely find yourself there.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.000
Esleet?

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.340
Yeah, I mean, I would say just be open to new opportunities.

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:26.300
So like, for example, if you're doing your PhD at the time, just make sure you take part

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:32.420
into teaching, for example, just to see whether you'd be comfortable doing it as a long term

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:32.900
career.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:40.300
And also, again, like Kayla said, you know, just go for at least just work in an industry,

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.060
maybe for one month or two months, just to see if you're comfortable.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:50.260
And yeah, and also just don't worry too much, I would say about the money when you finish

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:50.780
your PhD.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:57.060
Just make sure you get the right experience and just make sure you also learn new techniques,

00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:01.260
new tools, because yeah, I'm sure you get plenty of money.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:06.700
Yeah, that's a great point.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:12.500
Because I think the hardest part about getting a job in industry, data science programming

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.120
side of things, the hardest part is the first job.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.200
Go from zero to one.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:23.000
And once you've had that first job for a year or two, all of a sudden, many opportunities

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.340
open up to reposition yourself or to get a big raise or move up or whatever.

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.240
But getting that right experience is important.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:31.660
I agree.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.080
Yeah.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:32.440
Yeah.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:32.920
Jennifer?

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.560
Yeah, I think I most don't have much to add.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.720
So that is really good advice.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:42.780
But sometimes it can be hard to find people in industry to even talk to.

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:45.540
So I definitely recommend going to meetups.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.660
You can meet all kinds of people who work for all different kinds of companies.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:54.940
I think a lot of my concerns about working in industry are ones that would be true in big

00:45:54.940 --> 00:46:01.500
companies, like really, really big companies that are not so that don't exist or aren't

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.560
so apparent in smaller ones.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:08.100
For example, being siloed into small, very specific kinds of work that might happen in a much bigger

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.400
company or stringency to software engineering processes.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:17.440
Or even just knowing that some data scientists' jobs are more R&D, which might be more similar

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.540
to your academic style of working.

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:25.860
And others might be more about data engineering or productionizing data science models, machine

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.320
learning models.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.600
And so that's very different kinds of working that might, one of them might suit you better

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.020
than the other.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:35.760
So just knowing that those are out there and what benefits different kinds of work environments

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.800
might have would be good to know.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:42.220
Yeah, there's a really big difference between taking an ML model and then writing an API

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:49.680
to make it go versus researching what parameters you use to predict the likelihood of selling

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.700
a home.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:57.380
Yeah, I mean, working on toy data to get the most accurate model is one thing, but then optimizing

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:02.560
it to work for masses of streaming data on some kind of cloud platform is a completely different

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:02.900
problem.

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:08.120
And you might have to make sacrifices of accuracy for speed or, you know, any kinds of things.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.640
And there are all different kinds of problems.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.280
So yeah, you can meet or even, you might not even want to go to industry, you might want

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.620
to work for public service or government.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:15.880
Right.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.380
That's not necessarily industry per se, but also not academia.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.920
There's a lot out there.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.280
And you can meet all these people at meetups.

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.180
I recommend.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:27.500
I think to add on to that is like meeting people at meetups and trying to get an understanding

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:31.820
of like what the data teams are like within companies, especially if this is going to be

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.420
your first job out of academia.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:38.240
It's probably best that you find a company that already have a data science team of sorts

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.100
in the company.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.800
You don't really want to be the first data scientist because then you're not going to

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:43.540
learn from anyone.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.680
And I think as well, like if you've been in academia for years and years and if you've

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:52.300
gone like post-op, maybe some fellowships, and then you decide you want to make that change,

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:56.120
you sort of have to understand that you're no longer the expert.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:02.900
I think you build up quite a deep expertise in academia that you could all of a sudden become

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:07.760
the expert in this sort of really, really niche field that only other like 20 other people

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.660
are part of.

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:13.020
But as soon as you go into industry, you realize that actually there's now a broad spectrum

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:17.880
of data science skills and you're no longer the expert, even if you've got 20 years in

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.300
academia.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:22.760
So you sort of have to take that step back and say, right, I now need to learn this whole

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.180
range of other skills.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:24.880
Yeah.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.620
Unless you identify where you really are interested in, right?

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:27.900
Yeah.

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:28.180
Yeah.

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:28.820
Yeah.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.620
Well, that's all really good advice.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:37.220
And I want to second the idea of going to meetups and those kinds of events because

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:42.760
the earlier you are in that transition, the harder and the more alone it feels and like

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:47.300
the less guidance I think you feel like you have and you can go meet other people who are

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.420
in the same situation or more importantly, maybe they're one year farther down the path,

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:51.680
right?

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.060
They've made that step and like, this is what worked for me.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:59.420
I also want to encourage people to offer to speak at these meetups because I think that

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.500
makes a huge, huge difference.

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:07.000
I know when I started speaking at things like code camps and meetups and whatnot, it

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.960
gave me a much greater interaction with the community.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.520
I started getting job offers that I didn't know that I wanted, but I'm like, wait a minute,

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:14.800
really?

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.020
I could go do this?

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.720
It's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.740
And coming from academics, you're used to giving presentations anyway, right?

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:27.580
So if you can find something focused enough, meetups would love to have a 30 minute talk on

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.140
something that you've been studying and then now you're doing computationally, right?

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:30.380
Yeah.

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:35.900
I'm sure Kaylee can agree that it's always having Kaylee used to organize our ladies,

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.160
right?

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:36.760
Our ladies.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.160
Yeah.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:37.980
Our ladies, Manchester.

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:38.620
Yeah.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:42.280
And I currently organize Pi Day in Manchester and yeah, looking for speakers.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:47.080
We would love for people to just offer us to talk on any of our meetups and be, yeah,

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:47.820
always open.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:48.160
Yeah.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:53.300
And I don't want to speak for YouTube, but in general, I think if you were to say, go to an

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.140
organizer and say, I would love to talk about this, but could you give me just a little

00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:01.740
bit of advice and guidance and feedback just to kind of mentor me of like, what is expected?

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.060
Would this resonate?

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:06.360
You know, just a little bit of help for your first presentation.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.820
I'm sure you could get that help, right?

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:08.440
Oh yeah, definitely.

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.280
Yeah.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.400
Actually, we were thinking about having a meetup event.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.700
I don't think we've nailed down the details yet, but we were thinking of having a session

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:19.300
just like that to try and encourage people to give, to talk because especially depending

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:24.640
on where they are in academia and what kind of, what they're studying, they might not have

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.280
as many opportunities to give presentations.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:30.840
So they might not be as experienced.

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.200
Sure.

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:31.500
Yeah.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:31.800
Yeah.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.820
No, I think that's great.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:38.120
I think in data science, it can be very hard, like very easy to feel a bit like an imposter

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.400
because there's so much going on that you think, I don't know enough to speak at these

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:42.780
events.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:48.480
And what I found recently is actually finding what I did in my, so during my PhD and I did

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.700
change points section, I've now done quite a lot of talks on that because I found that

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:55.840
when I do do talks, it's something that I know about, but it's also something that other

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:56.760
people don't know about.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.560
So then they like to come and ask questions.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:05.060
So I think even though you might think your topic is only small or isn't as broad as some

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.720
of the other data science topics, once you start to like present it and get more comfortable

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.420
presenting something, you know, it then makes it easier to present on something you don't

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:15.460
know as much about, but you're sort of trying to learn about.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:18.060
And it's easy to think everyone knows more than me.

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:20.700
When I go on the internet, everyone seems so smart.

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:21.880
I have no idea.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:27.300
But then in practice, you know, you go and you give one of these presentations and you

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:30.820
might ask like, all right, who has a lot of experience doing this thing I'm about to talk

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:31.020
about?

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:35.420
And you're thinking everyone's going to put their hand up and like two hands out of 20

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:35.720
go up.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.740
You're like, oh, wait, these people don't have a lot of experience.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.140
I'm going to be able to teach them something.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:42.280
And I think that's actually really surprising and great.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:42.560
Yeah.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:48.620
I actually think it works the other way because even if you presented something that there was

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:52.400
an expert in the room, that's probably a good thing as well, because they can then give you

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.940
the feedback that you might not have got from anyone else.

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:59.780
And then actually like mentor you or train you or welcome you into their team and say,

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.300
we're actually doing something like this.

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.060
Come and join us.

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:02.320
Yeah.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:07.220
But anyone else, but I find giving a presentation helps me learn more about what I'm talking about

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:07.620
as well.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:10.800
Like I might, I might think I understand, but it's not until you try to explain it that

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:14.760
you, you realize there's holes in your understanding and then you have to go and sort of fill

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.660
in those holes.

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:16.700
Oh, absolutely.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:22.340
I think that getting some concept put together so you can present it clearly, you've got

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.240
to figure out what is the essence of this thing.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.780
You've got to distill it down.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:29.680
And also you have to just have a different way of thinking about it.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:34.760
And I think the PhD research side of the world works really well here because if you're going

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:39.000
to use some technology in a program, you just have to get some way to work.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.100
There might be three ways you could solve this problem.

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.960
If one of them works, you're done, right?

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.860
Like the problem solved.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.900
But if you're going to talk about it, you have to say, well, there's these three ways

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:50.420
and in this situation, you use this one, but that situation is that one.

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:51.440
And here's the trade-offs.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:56.180
And like that kind of deeper level of research, I think it really matches well with those kinds

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:56.760
of presentations.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:03.720
I think one of my goals this year was to actually do a talk, but obviously coronavirus had to

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.060
talk.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.040
Yeah.

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.440
So that is so unfortunate.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:08.760
Yeah.

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.380
So what were you going to talk on?

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:10.980
What were you thinking?

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:15.980
Well, actually I hadn't decided, but I just wanted to pick anything, even if I wasn't good

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:22.940
at it, just to pick one topic and just do some research, learn about it and then do a presentation

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:27.520
and then talk to, for example, Jennifer, because she has more experience.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:33.560
She's done so many talks at those meetups and, you know, talk to someone who's more experienced

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:38.620
and show her, for example, my presentation and just, yeah, to get some feedback.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:39.700
I love feedback.

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:40.020
Yeah.

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:40.380
Yeah.

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:42.740
And then to go out there and give a talk.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.480
Yeah.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:45.460
So that was one of my goals.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.480
I don't know if it's going to happen, but fingers crossed.

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.600
Let's hope all this just, yeah.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.240
Yeah, I hope so.

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.400
There are some virtual meetups happening.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.980
So I'm talking at a virtual meetup on Thursday.

00:53:54.980 --> 00:54:01.220
So Her Plus Data, which is the event that inspired this podcast, actually got cancelled a few

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.920
weeks ago because of coronavirus, but they've moved it to a virtual meeting on Thursday.

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:09.360
I don't know if that makes it better or worse, like speaking to a screen where you can't

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.260
get feedback from anyone.

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:14.280
But if they're going to do another virtual one, you could like, if that interested you,

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.320
you can try and get on the speaker lineup for the one after.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.240
Oh, thank you.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:17.820
Yeah.

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:18.280
Cheers.

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.080
Yeah, absolutely.

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.260
I don't know if it makes it easier or better.

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:25.080
I've done a lot of in-person presentations, but also virtual ones.

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.780
And they both have their own challenges, right?

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:32.480
Like if you stand in front of a crowd of, you know, 500 people, that's intimidating.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:37.420
But also if you just stare at your screen and you have no feedback and you don't even know

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:41.060
for sure if your audio and video is cutting out and they're even hearing you, like that's

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:43.180
also really, it could be distracting and hard.

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:46.780
So yeah, it's different challenges, but I'm glad you're still getting to speak.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:47.180
That's great.

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:47.360
Yeah.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:53.620
I mean, Pi Data Manchester started, we had our first streamed, live streamed panel event a

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:54.260
couple of weeks ago.

00:54:54.260 --> 00:55:00.300
I think we had everyone on a hangout that there were three panelists and the person asking

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.780
them the questions on a hangout.

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.640
And then that was streamed to YouTube live.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:10.420
And I think that might've been odd for the panelists as well, because they didn't have,

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:11.980
as you said, they didn't have any feedback.

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.380
They could only see the other panelists.

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:15.580
They could only see who they're directly talking to.

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:20.140
They didn't, they didn't have YouTube open and have access to like how many viewers it currently

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:22.100
had or what comments were going down the side or whatnot.

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:23.520
So yeah, it must be quite odd.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:23.980
Yeah.

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:24.960
It's a challenge.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.160
You want to give a quick shout out to Pi Data Manchester.

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.500
You all seem like you're involved in that.

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:33.120
And it's, if you're doing virtual stuff, people could attend from all over even.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:33.640
Yes.

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.600
Let us know.

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.700
Eslyn as well, of course.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:40.640
Maybe you'll get two or more speaking opportunities this year, which would be fabulous.

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.340
Yeah.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.060
Pi Data.

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:43.800
That would be great.

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.220
Yeah.

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:44.460
Yeah.

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:49.840
We got monthly meetups and a monthly code night where you can bring a project and get help

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:50.360
and give help.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.500
And we also do monthly podcasts.

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.100
Super.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:53.420
Yeah.

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.260
Yeah.

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:56.720
You'll have to give me the links to put in the show notes so people can check it out.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:56.920
Cool.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.360
All right.

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.180
Well, ladies, we're getting close on time.

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:01.900
So I think we'll have to leave it there.

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:06.680
But it's really interesting to get a look at how you went through your academic side of

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.320
things and then moved over and what you're doing now and that perspective.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.420
It's been really, really good.

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:14.040
But before you get out of here, you've got to answer the two quick questions at the end,

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:19.140
which are if you're going to do some data science, write some Python code, what editor

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:19.800
do you use?

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.760
Jennifer, go first.

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:24.140
I jump around between three depending on what I'm working on or how I'm working.

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:26.240
Atom, Spider, and Jupyter.

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.120
Notebooks.

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:27.940
Okay.

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:28.460
JupyterLab.

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.020
Yeah, right on.

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:29.640
Yeah, sure.

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.020
That's the next one, right?

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:31.740
Latest.

00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:32.200
Esleen?

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.020
Yeah, I use Atom, Spider, and Jupyter as well.

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:35.860
Yeah, those are great.

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:36.660
Kaylee?

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:42.340
So I mostly use R, so I'm an RStudio person because I think that's an editor for R.

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.980
But when I'm trying to do Python, I'm using VS Code at the moment.

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:46.800
Cool.

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.020
Yeah.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.400
We're doing neat stuff there.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.400
I've heard good things about VS Code, though.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:50.700
Yeah.

00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:51.440
I really like it.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:55.020
I tried using Jupyter Notebooks, but I'm not a huge fan of Notebooks.

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:56.740
So it seems to work well.

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:56.940
Yeah.

00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:57.900
They've got some really good plugins.

00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.480
Yeah.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:04.940
I don't think I've fully experienced everything it can do, but I think I've probably set it

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:09.120
up to run too much like RStudio, so I'm probably not doing things up Python-y way.

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.260
There's so many options in all those extensions there.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:16.220
You can go, everyone can have a different experience with the same thing.

00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:16.760
Yeah.

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:17.100
Pretty much.

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:17.740
Yeah, for sure.

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:18.460
All right.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:24.920
And then maybe one of you could throw out a notable Python package that, or a couple of

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.900
you, whoever wants to, notable PyPI package that you've

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:31.360
recently used that was awesome or worth telling people about.

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:36.420
I'd say Vader Sentiment.

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:41.780
Vader Sentiment, which is an analysis tool specifically for Twitter tweets.

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:49.520
So it's NLP, but takes into account how people tweet, which is not like how people officially

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:49.900
write.

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:50.100
Right.

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:50.760
Right.

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.360
Because you couldn't feed it like an article.

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:56.760
Train it on an article and then feed it a tweet of like, well, this person's really frustrated

00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.900
because they are really terse.

00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:59.500
No, that's the limit.

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:04.500
If it's a word written in all caps, it takes that into account to weight the score or how

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:08.300
many exclamation points are used or I think also emoticons or emojis.

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:12.980
So it takes into account, it sort of understands tweet speak as it were.

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:14.460
It's Vader Sentiment, huh?

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:14.720
Yeah.

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.360
Vader, like Darth Vader.

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.300
Vader Sentiment.

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:18.820
Oh, Vader.

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:19.300
Yeah.

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.620
Vader Sentiment.

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:22.860
It's a GitHub project.

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.760
I'm not sure if it's PIPA.

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.060
Yeah.

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:24.440
I see.

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:24.960
Yeah.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.240
It's on GitHub.

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:26.860
I'll put it on.

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.780
I'll put it in the show notes.

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:28.280
Very cool.

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:28.960
Very cool.

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:29.340
Yeah.

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.160
I was going to mention Sublime Text.

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:36.800
So that's more like a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.480
And also DataGrip.

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:43.700
So DataGrip is, that provides context sensitive code completion.

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.700
So it's good for SQL queries.

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.000
And yeah.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:47.640
So it's...

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:47.760
Yeah.

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.860
DataGrip is super cool.

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.300
It blows me away.

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:54.560
You can do a query and it just understands all the different structures.

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:57.920
And then it's also built into PyCharm.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:03.000
And in PyCharm, if you write a string in a Python program, it'll autocomplete inside the

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.700
string, the stuff out of the database, which is less like crazy.

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.560
So anyway, it's a good time to be programming.

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:11.020
The tools these days and the libraries are so awesome.

00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:11.420
Yeah.

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:11.860
All right.

00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.760
Well, that's it for our show, ladies.

00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:14.520
Thank you for being here.

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.820
It's really been fun to talk to you.

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.840
Thank you so much.

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:17.500
Yeah.

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:17.920
Thank you.

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.560
It's fun really, right?

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:18.840
Yeah.

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:19.520
Yep.

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.360
Cheers.

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:20.680
Bye.

00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.120
Bye.

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:21.600
Cheers.

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.380
