00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.680
Every year, Python has a new major release. This year, it's Python 3.12, and it'll come out on

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.320
October 2nd, 2023. That's four days from when this episode was published. There is quite a process

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.460
involved to test build and ship Python across the many platforms and channels. We have Seth

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.780
Michael Larson here to give us a detailed rundown on exactly what is involved in releasing CPython.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.120
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 431, recorded September 28th, 2023.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.460
I agree.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:44.200
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python. This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.760
Hey there. Before we jump into talking about building CPython, I have a new course to tell you about.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.440
HTMX plus Django. Full web apps hold the JavaScript.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.320
This is an excellent new Django course written by Christopher Trudeau.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.420
In just a few hours, you'll learn how to make your app much more interactive,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.280
and the code even a little cleaner than pure Django.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.100
You may be familiar with our HTMX plus Flask course I released a while ago,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.720
and this one is its Django sister course.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.560
And it is out now at talkpython.fm/HTMX dash Django.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.020
The link is in your show notes.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.080
If you Django and have been wanting to adopt HTMX, you should definitely give this course a look.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.620
And a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has purchased one of our courses or library bundles.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.600
It truly makes this show possible.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.340
Now, on to that interview.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.380
Hey, all. Hey, Seth.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.840
Hello.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.700
Awesome to have you here on the show.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.040
Yeah, thanks for having me.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.280
Absolutely. I'm looking forward to talking about the details, the steps of releasing CPython.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.180
And for those of you who have not been watching and paying attention, by the time this comes out,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.420
it'll probably have already happened.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.100
I'm sure it's already happened.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.620
By the time this video is up, though, it's not quite happening.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.580
So as of the recording, next Monday, this whole process that we're going to talk about goes into action, right?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.200
Releasing Python 3.11.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.740
Yeah.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.220
This, not 3.12.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.400
This will have happened.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.320
3.12.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.960
I got to get used to it.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.180
It's like, you know, in January, you always write the year on.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.400
So 3.12, the new version, the still faster, faster CPython 3.12 with lots of cool features is going to be out.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.240
And how does that happen, right?

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.800
There's a lot going on behind the scenes.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.900
And you wrote a really cool blog post called Visualizing the CPython Release Process or something like that.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.600
I'm getting off memory.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.580
And it has a great diagram with a whole bunch of boxes.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.440
And so we're going to go through and kind of just talk about how that happens and so on.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.900
But before we get into it, maybe a quick intro for folks who don't know you yet.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.340
Yeah.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.600
So I'm Seth Larson.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.940
Online, everywhere, I am Seth M. Larson.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.620
That's my handle.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.060
And I am the security developer in residence at the Python Software Foundation, the inaugural security developer in residence.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.820
Hopefully for more, obviously.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:50.940
But yeah, this whole role is funded through the OpenSSF Alpha Omega project specifically.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:59.240
And it's kind of a project that's focusing on Alpha being really, really important projects that everyone agrees, yep, that's a really important project to secure.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.340
So among them is Python and PyPI.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.360
And then Omega is kind of like the long tail, right?

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.820
Like all the other projects.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.420
Because there's open source is huge.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.900
There's millions of different projects.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.660
How can we secure those?

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.320
And so, yeah, this role exists because of them.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.040
So I'm very thankful.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.460
And it's mostly.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.340
As are we all.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.620
Right.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.600
Speaking for the community.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.660
This has been something.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.820
Yeah.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.720
There's been a lot of places where it's like, well, why doesn't someone take care of this?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.360
Like, well, there's nobody whose sole job it is.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.900
But like Python has been slowly rolling in these new roles, which is fantastic.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.580
Like Lukash Lenga at the developer in residence.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.260
You're the security developer in residence.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.700
We have Mike Fiedler, who I spoke to about on PyPI security.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.640
Like there's people.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.260
There's developers working on stuff.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.680
It's awesome.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.040
There's something to be said.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.960
Like having someone working on stuff full time, like you can get a lot done.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.360
It's quite nice because we're so used to, you know, how the speed of open source.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.760
Right.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.360
Which is not.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.560
I guess when someone says the speed of open source, they don't immediately think, oh, yeah,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.600
that's going to be that's going to be fast and snappy because people have lives.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.060
Sometimes it is.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.320
Yeah.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.320
Well, sometimes it is.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.000
When things are brand new, they can have a lot of momentum.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.460
But, you know, my personal view is like on all these software projects, there's these

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.700
little gnarly edges that is just as fun for no one.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.120
Right.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.200
And like, I want to add this new feature or I want to add async to this thing so people can

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.140
do this and like you can get so inspired, even if it's not your job and it's just your

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.300
project and really go on it.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.300
But like, you know, really polishing out that little bit of documentation or or updating that

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.520
detour.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.720
Like it's it's all the the fine polish, I guess, that I think you all are bringing to

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.880
Python, which is awesome.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.320
Yeah.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.320
There's tons of work.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.080
That's like it really does need that amount of time investment and like a sustained time

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.460
investment.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.420
So like when you're working with external groups or like, you know, developing processes and

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.260
stuff like that, like you just need you just need to be there a lot more than, you know,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.940
weekends.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.420
So it's good to have that full time presence.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.040
Yeah.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.660
Yeah.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.920
I think it is, too.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.400
Although it's absolutely mind blowing how much stuff gets done in traditional pure open

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.700
source.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.880
It really is.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.120
Honestly, it gives a whole new perspective to it.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.340
Right.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.720
It's like, oh, yeah.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.280
You know, all of this is happening.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.460
But, you know, almost all of the people that I interact with on a day to day basis are volunteers.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.960
And so like I when I kind of wrote about this a little bit in my opening when I announced

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.480
myself as a security developer in residence, but it's like you need to you can't have expectations

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.280
and like assign people work.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.940
You know what I mean?

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.680
Like this is not a traditional work environment where you can just tell people what to do.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.460
And, you know, it it's a certain way of working.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.960
And I'm used to it because I am an open source maintainer myself.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.380
So it makes a lot of sense to me and I feel very comfortable with it.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.700
But it's very different than a regular security developer job would be.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.640
Would you say fewer TPS reports?

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.360
Yeah, a few fewer.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.880
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.120
Just a couple fewer.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.340
Hey, you since you brought it up, maybe we'll come back to this if we have time at the end.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.140
But, you know, you've got some pretty notable projects that you're working on here.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.000
Like give a quick shout out to some of your open source work that predates.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.360
Yeah.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.080
So I am the lead maintainer of your lib3, which is one of the most downloaded Python packages

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.600
on PyPI.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.920
I also help maintain requests.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.460
It's a user of your lib3.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.700
And then in addition to that, I have a library, which I quite love, which is called TrustStore,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.200
which is being adopted by a lot of package managers right now, like pip and Conda and PDM,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:33.400
which allows those those packages to use system certificates as opposed to something like Certify

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:42.140
so that you can take advantage of all of the benefits that you get for using a system trust store for HTTPS as opposed to like a static bundle of certificates.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.180
Because operating systems are actually constantly checking, updating all of these things.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.140
It's just a little bit better.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.760
Some certificate store or some certificate authority turns out to be shady and they get revoked and.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.040
Or just not have not have the best practices.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.180
And so, yeah, just like, OK, we're going to pull that one.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.440
But we're even pulling us.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.640
Yeah, they even get stolen.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:04.980
Right.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.700
Sometimes these certificates get stolen.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.780
They get stolen.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.740
You know, there's all sorts of things that can go wrong.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.640
Thankfully, it doesn't go wrong very often.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.820
Otherwise, it would be a lot bigger of a problem.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.080
But yeah, it does happen every once in a while.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.740
Yeah, that's cool.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.180
Yeah.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:23.280
And you were on Python Bytes, my other podcast I do with Brian to talk about trust store, which is cool.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:23.820
All right.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.460
Back to this.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:29.020
So tell us a bit about this developer, security developer in residence role.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.160
Like people were like, oh, this maybe they've heard of it or is maybe even new to them.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.220
But like, what is your what is your job here in the PSF space?

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:44.840
Yeah, it's it's it's kind of funny talking about my role, too, because people see security through so many different lenses.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.900
And this is even like outside of talking to people online that are in the open source space.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.580
So whenever I talk about this job, people will say, oh, so you do IT security for the PSF.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.780
I'm like, well, no, I don't do that.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.720
And then they'll say, oh, so you secure.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.120
Yeah, right.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.900
I'm in.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.980
No, no, no.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.760
So I don't do that.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.420
I don't do IT security for the PSF.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:13.840
And then the next question they usually ask is like, oh, so you make it so that Python is more secure, like the code of Python is more secure.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.040
And I'm like, not really.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.400
Honestly, I don't do that either.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:24.780
And what I really do is try my best to make it so that bad stuff doesn't happen to Python users.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.940
And so, you know, obviously those things are important, like securing Python, the actual code itself.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:42.420
But on like the scale factor, maybe those are a little bit less important than some things like making sure that when you download something from Python.org, it is the correct thing.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:42.660
Right.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:51.280
Making sure that when a release is happening for Python, nothing can subvert that release and get injected in and then distributed to everyone.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.320
And then it goes beyond Python when you start thinking about like the packaging space.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:05.980
So like making sure that HIP release process is good, making sure that the all of these like tools and stuff that are using all of these binary libraries.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.680
How can you be sure that those libraries that are bundled along with them don't have vulnerabilities?

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.960
And then a lot of things around like process.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:23.740
So vulnerability management and making sure that, you know, vulnerabilities that are discovered in Python and reported to us, they actually get to the end of the process where they're fixed and released.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:36.480
There's just a whole bunch of things like that where it's more of like a scale and safety and like making sure that my effort goes towards things that are going to keep on churning as opposed to things that are like spot fixes.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:36.860
Right.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.620
Because sure.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:45.680
Spot fixes, they're important, but they don't have the scale and they don't have that like keep on giving you the value aspect of them.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.080
Yeah.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.620
And the consequence of a lot of what you described sounds like supply chain type issues.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.000
The consequence of that is so bad.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.780
It doesn't matter how patched your computer is or how good your firewall is.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.680
If CPython itself ships with a virus.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.240
Right.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.700
Right.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.160
Yeah.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.200
Or somebody snuck it in right at the build.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.540
Yeah.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:05.980
Yeah.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.180
Right.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:06.380
Right.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:06.600
Right.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.100
And so it's good that you focus on those.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.040
Nobody wants that.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.540
Well, almost nobody wants that.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.060
Very few people want this.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.640
So those are not good people.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.760
We don't want them to want this.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.600
We don't.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.720
We don't take them into consideration for their use cases.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.160
We sure don't.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.680
Awesome.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.160
And let's see.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.080
I believe you're on.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.080
Well, when I read the article, you're on week nine.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.060
So you're on week 10.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.340
Is that where we are?

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.440
I think I'm on week 12 at this point.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:30.960
Oh, man.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.520
Time flies.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:31.820
Yeah.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.240
I know.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.180
I'm actually drafting up like a quarterly review.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.900
And it's a big thing.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.600
So, yeah.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.000
Okay.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.900
See, a quick question from the audience here on the live stream.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:47.400
You know, Lewis asks, is there a visibility or will there be a public visibility for CVEs in packages?

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.400
That is an excellent question.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.360
It is a good question.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.280
And I bring this up because didn't the PSF just get certified as like a CVE authority or whatever that is?

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.520
Like ability to create CVEs?

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.100
I don't know.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.080
Yeah, I can I can talk so much about this.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.300
Right.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.520
So there there's a whole bunch of stuff happening in that space.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:21.980
So I'll start off with stuff that I did not personally do, but I'm helping maintain now, which is there is an advisory database called if you go on GitHub, it's GitHub.com slash PyPA slash advisory database with a dash in between advisory and database.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:35.640
And that database is essentially trying to categorize all of the CVEs and what versions they affect for every single package on the Python package index, which is an impossible task.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.140
But so we're trying our best there.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.460
But yeah, so one of the packages, no problem.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.220
No problem.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:41.400
Right.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.220
Like that's a that's a manual task right there.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.860
Yeah.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.120
No.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:51.880
So what this actually does is for the bulk of it, what it will do is it'll go out and it'll pull the CVE feed from NBD and MITRE.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:13:00.060
And it will parse it and try to find references to Python packages and versions inside of CVEs.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.780
So obviously that's sometimes there's false positives, but a lot of the times there's just it just works out OK.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.060
And there's a little bit of triage involved.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.440
There's a little bit of manual submission of this, too.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:21.860
But yeah, so tools like pip Audit, which is a tool that I love so much, uses this database in addition to other scanning tools like any scanning tool can use this database.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.880
But yeah, this is the canonical location for vulnerabilities affecting Python packages.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:43.800
So for Python itself, the Python Software Foundation just recently, like a few weeks ago, announced that we are now a CVE numbering authority, which means that we are we kind of have like a scope of just Python and pip right now.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.440
So those are the only two projects that we're emitting CVEs for.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:55.920
And what that means we can do is it means that people have to submit reports to us, which is good because then they can't submit them to other places and get CVEs that way.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.760
It can be kind of frustrating because in the past, sometimes that would happen.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.100
And then we wouldn't know about the vulnerability until it got published as a CVE.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.560
And we'd be like, what just happened?

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:13.640
Like one of the big deals is you're supposed to be told in an ideal world, you're supposed to be given like a come knock in the back door like that WebP code.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.080
We're going to need to talk about the WebP code before.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.460
Yeah.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.020
Oh, gosh.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.100
Don't get me started on WebP.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.280
Don't get me started on WebP.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.840

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.860
PyCharm.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.600
It's how I get work done.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:28.620
The real, like, the ideal process is someone would Google, like, Python and security, or, like, Python and reported vulnerability, and then they would find these, like, really lovely instructions that someone else wrote up to say, just send an email to security at python.org with whatever information you have, and then we triage that.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:35.900
And if we decided it's a vulnerability, we would ask for a CVE on your behalf and, like, credit you and all this stuff, and then fix it.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.320
And then the release and publication of the CVE would happen at the same time.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.140
So that's what we call coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.940
And so instead of, like, oh, there's a vulnerability, but there's no fix available for that vulnerability, like, that's what you want to avoid.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:17:05.500
Because it causes panic, and in theory, it could cause exposure, right, where there's some dwell time in between when people, or it doesn't minimize the dwell time between when people are able to patch and when the vulnerability is known to potential attackers.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.040
Right.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.340
There's already a latency boom from when it's announced to somebody actually fixing it.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.060
But if when you hear it, you can't actually fix it for two more weeks because it's not released.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:19.840
Well, that just gives people two weeks to try to dissect, like, what exactly do they mean by there's this image problem?

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.180
Exactly.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.060
Exactly.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.700
Oh, yeah.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.620
I'm going to look at my image, yeah.

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.080
We're going to start talking about LibWebP, actually.

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.080
Yeah, the...

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.060
No, I'm just using it.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.060
Like, it's the most recent example, because last night there was a...

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:36.520
And it's really relevant to CVEs because there was some drama that Apple patched some of their code.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:43.920
When Google announced it, it looked like it was only applied to Chrome, but it actually applied to anything that used WebP, which, looking at the updates, is like, everything.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.580
Everything on my computer needs to be updated because of it.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.520
You know, like, that mismatch was, like, caused a lot of drama.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.960
I definitely agree.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:18:02.180
Yeah, there was, like, a week of time in between when that CVE just mentioned Chrome and Apple, and then when it actually ended up mentioning LibWebP.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:06.500
And then right when it mentioned LibWebP, I'm like, oh, I know a lot of Python packages use that.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.060
And so I then went out and go and talk to those people.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:09.500
Oh, interesting.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.860
And they fixed those things now.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.140
So.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.040
Yeah, that's great.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.860
Another good reason to stay on top of dependency management and stuff, right?

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.640
Like tools.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:28.160
One of the things I think we're coming to sort of understand and manage better in the Python space is not your dependencies, but the transitive closure of your dependencies.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.700
Right?

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:39.260
So I might use, let me just say, I guess, what if I use Pillow to work with images, but Pillow itself uses some other library that it pip installs that itself might have some kind of image code.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.680
If I say I use Pillow, oh, I need to update it.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.000
Pip install --upgrade.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.180
Pillow doesn't upgrade its dependencies and those dependencies of the, right?

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.160
So like, but that could be where a lot of silence issues live.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:04.140
And so things like poetry, flit, pip-tools, there's a lot of tools coming on that I think are gaining popularity that treat not just what you directly wanted to pip install, but its friends and its dependencies.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.060
Yeah, definitely.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.280
What do you think about that from a security perspective?

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:07.900
Yes.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:17.960
So having the most important thing from like a kind of dependency management side of things is having those lock files and having them have hashes.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.040
Like it's, it's less of a problem now.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:29.400
Like I, it likely won't come to fruition that those hashes end up being important, but luckily lots of lock file formats do generate hashes anyways, which is great.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.860
So that subverts attacks against PyPI partially.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.040
We're in the middle DNS madness.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.360
Right.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:36.640
Yeah.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:42.400
Like if somehow you've been tricked into using a bad certificate or something, right?

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.800
Like it, it saves you from a lot of stuff like that.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.800
So having hashes, they're basically free.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.540
They're great.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.380
Just use those.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:53.760
The other side of it is running a vulnerability checker against those dependencies.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.640
Cause then you'll, or either that or having a tool that's doing that for you.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.020
So like depend a bot is a tool that does that for you.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:05.900
It will check vulnerability databases and then give you like a security notification or a PR to say,

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:12.940
Hey, this is affected by a medium severity vulnerability, or you can run them your own via pip audit with.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.880
It can either check an already installed environment or it can check like a requirements file.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.780
I don't know the full extent of all the different file types that I can check.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:30.400
I know that it works on requirements.txt, but yeah, it, it'll check those files for known vulnerabilities and all of the transitive dependencies, just everything that's available.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.620
And then from there, it'll tell you, Hey, these are the things that you need to fix.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.820
Here are the fixed versions.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.620
Like try upgrading to at least this, doesn't mean that it's easy.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.940
Um, advisory database you talked about.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.860
It does go back to that advisory database.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.260
Yeah.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:53.860
And it also can hook into OSV, dot dev, which is kind of like this global, aggregation of tons of different vulnerability databases.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:59.100
So for example, we have one for Python that I pointed out, but then like rust has one.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.600
Debian has one.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.740
Uh, what is it?

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.960
Uh, Rocky Linux, I think has one.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.660
Like there's just a whole bunch of them and you can kind of interface with this database using the same API and it's, it's kind of nice.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.500
So, yeah.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:17.420
So making this a security show, we just talked to Mike Fiedler a little while ago about that as well.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.040
Diving into it.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:24.620
I mean, we'll come back to the release process, but I do want to ask you about this is one of the challenges I see is like I got to depend about a warning.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:31.040
Luckily it was for basically the requirements dash dev side, not the true requirement.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:40.560
You know, like I'm going to use a bunch more tools to do like Jupyter stuff on my data, but I'm really just running a website and there's like a much smaller, a smaller set of things on there.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:49.000
But there was a vulnerability report for something, some package that was in my requirements, for the dev verge, the dev setup.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.080
However, when I tried to go update it, one other package that is the reason that was there said, no, it has to be less than something.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.140
And that something was less than the fix.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.000
And I'm like, how do I square these two things?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.940
Like I can pip install it, but then it keeps complaining that you're, you're running the wrong version.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.700
Like, no, I'm not.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.740
The other one has a remote CVE and, you know, a remote code execution in it.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.300
And I'm like, I really don't want that.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.160
I mean, not a server.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.240
So it's probably fine, but I really don't want that.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.500
No, I'm, I don't care if it's slightly more unstable.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.560
I want the new one.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.300
Give it to me.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.040
Right.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.800
And that's, that's a bit of a challenge.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:32.000
I think, when you say like, I've got 50 dependencies and I've got to somehow square, I need to get a brand new one right away.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.840
What are your thoughts on that?

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.700
Yeah, this, this is a super tough problem.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.160
And I think it's one that open source will be coming to reckon with even more now, right?

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:51.420
Because we're kind of at a, in a place now where there's a few really important libraries, which are kind of moving something that is very extensively and widely used to be not maintained anymore.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:23:01.140
For example, open SSL, open SSL one or 1.1.1, which is extremely widely used, is no longer maintained.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.080
There's going to be no more security patches for that.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:13.220
And it's, it's going to be tough because my guess is that there's also just a lot of software that's not built for open SSL three being the, the, the open SSL of choice.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:13.460
Right.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:20.580
Luckily, Python is not in that situation, but it's, it's certainly like a thing that other pieces of software might have to deal with.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:32.020
Um, in terms of Python packaging, this is kind of why the guidance on don't specify an upper bound, unless you know that that upper bound like makes sense.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:39.660
And like, so like backwards incompatibility, like, yeah, maybe you want to say, okay, if this is version 2.1. whatever.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.620
And it's some ver, you can say, okay, anything less than three is probably fine.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.780
Um, but even that, right.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.400
If you, if that package goes unmaintained.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.660
Yeah, this one from two to three and its main version, right.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.760
It's, it's major version.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.160
So.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:51.680
Right.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.120
Yeah.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.420
So this is, this is a difficulty.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.080
Yeah.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.180
There's a lot of packages that set hard upper bounds.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:04.560
And I just, I, I don't know why, because I, maybe it, it's going to break it, but I feel like it's speculative.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.700
Like, ah, we should probably not let a major version run, but you know, that, that leads into trouble.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:09.980
Right.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.580
Like, even if you just want to use some other library that says greater than or equal to three, and this one says less than three.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.140
You're like, great.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.080
Now, what do I do?

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.200
Yeah.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.460
I think that the toughest thing is that you can't go back and then like amend it.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.420
Um, yeah, that's the hardest part is because.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:33.380
So I, I will speak very, very highly of all of these, anything that can make pip automatically get the right thing is just magical is so good.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.920
And so people like that.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:43.300
And I totally get why people are doing these upper bound, sorts of things, but yeah, it does have the issues that you, that you talked about.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.380
But yeah, there's something to say about how great the, those bound checks are.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:25:00.220
I wish there was a way that you could add something like some sort of guidance to pip to say after the fact, like, okay, I said this was open, but now I'm going to go ahead and tell you that like, this definitely doesn't work with this version.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.880
Maybe that's something that can get recommended, but yeah, it's just so nice when it does work out.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:05.560
Yeah.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:05.620
Yeah.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:15.860
I, I can relate to Frank here who writes with 1.3,000 or 1,300 dependencies in our project because of this dependencies are at all times.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:16.380
Yeah.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.420
I have on Talk Python Training, the courses website.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.700
I think there's 248 packages.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:26.380
If you look at what's installed and then the dependencies, and then you try to throw in the data sciencey stuff.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.580
And it's just like, there's a 50, 50 chance that I can actually install everything.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:34.120
Cause like half the time, something has got a less than, something's got a greater than.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.160
And I'm like, Oh my God, as you upgrade, right?

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:41.020
Like at any point in time, it's deterministic, but you're over at over the evolution of it.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:41.220
Right.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:41.660
Yeah.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.780
No, it's, it's tough.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.660
It's tough when you start getting to that number.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.040
Like there's just so many intertangled things.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:47.660
There are.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:54.700
And like, the reason I bring this up now is it's, it's a hassle when like, I want to use this library and that library and somehow I've got to like juggle things.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:00.380
So they work, but it's concerning when you get a depend about alert that says there's a remote code execution.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.260
You're going to need to deal with it and your dependencies won't let you upgrade.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.180
You know what I mean?

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.860
Like that's, that's why I bring this up.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.300
It's, it's definitely concerning.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:08.620
Yeah.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:14.640
Another thing that you can do, and this is, I feel like they don't talk about this as much with depend about is that there are ways.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.120
to mitigate vulnerabilities that doesn't necessarily have to come from upgrading.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:28.860
Like I'm always going to say upgrading your dependency is the best way to go forward because then you know that there's no chance of at least that vulnerability in particular being exploited.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.180
But if it's something like remote code execution, but it's this one component, right?

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.280
As long as you're not using that component, then you're fine.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:40.980
Or if it's remote code execution, when you get some sort of input, whatever, right.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.700
That's, that's malformed or whatever.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.580
And you're like, okay, well that component's not exposed to the network.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.860
It's, I only use it internally.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.220
So there is something to say.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.260
It's not even a server.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.860
It doesn't open a port, right?

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.480
It's just a thing I run on my computer.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.100
It's like, it probably doesn't matter.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:56.840
Exactly.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.140
Yeah.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.200
And that's, that's kind of the hard part.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.200
I'm the one typing into it.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.520
And it's like, but if it's in your website, then all of a sudden it gets a little trickier, right?

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.480
Then it gets dicier.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:04.800
Yeah.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.120
Definitely.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:05.440
Yeah.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.660
The stakes are higher when you attach the internet to anything.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.720
But when it's like a local script, it's probably going to be okay.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:10.980
Just look at your log file.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.060
Just tell your log file.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.300
And it's request, request, hack, hack, request, attempted hack, request.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:16.960
It's just nonstop.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.520
WP login.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:17.860
Yes.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.260
Yeah.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.000
WP admin.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.340
All them things.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:20.620
Yeah.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.240
It's usually, luckily it's WP something or something most of the time.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.720
So you're good.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.760
You're safe against 90%.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.380
We're all good.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.380
As long as you don't return a 200 to any of those, like your traffic will remain low.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:31.860
Yeah.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:32.500
Absolutely.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.320
All right.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.040
So that's what you're doing.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.500
You're focusing on these kinds of things.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.540
That's really, really awesome.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.860
And thanks for giving us an even more detailed look than I expected into it.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.560
Yeah.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.840
Let's talk about your, let's talk about, you know, the timely thing.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.520
I mean, security is always timely, but the CPython, let me see if I get this right.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.900
312 release coming up here on Monday.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.620
Dang.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.320
He's got it.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:56.680
Amazing.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.740
I got it, man.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.300
I'm ready.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.880
I'm ready for this new, new world.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.820
So there is a PEP and let's see who, who put this together.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.380
This is Barry Warsaw and Guido.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.600
And it is PEP 101.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.760
I love it.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.800
PEP 101.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.700
The one you need, right?

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.360
Yeah.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.380
What a perfect number.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.440
But it's, it's the, the title is doing Python releases 101.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.780
That's kind of a circular.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.280
I love it.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:25.360
And it just talks about all the steps and it's kind of a manual of now you do this and now

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:25.840
you do that.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.800
But it's just a really long doc.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.540
I love the stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.020
There's like, there's like all caps all across.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:35.940
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.060
Did you do this right?

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:37.540
Right?

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.100
Yep.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.060
That you can tell, you can always tell when there were problems in the past in a checklist,

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:43.580
right?

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.760
Like if there ever was something that happened incorrectly, it's, it's very obvious.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.500
And so, yeah, the stop, stop, stop.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:55.480
I feel that that, I don't personally know why that's there, but I do laugh every time

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:55.900
I see it.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.100
So.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.680
Yeah.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.060
Let's see.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.780
Please note how PEP 101 replaces PEP 102.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.940
Time traveling was invented there.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.840
What is the.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.280
Yeah.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:04.940
At the very top.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.720
It's, I wanted to comment on that too.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.200
It said replaces PEP 102.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:14.460
And I, I wonder if it was more like a, oh, we should just use one-on-one sort of situation.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.760
Well, I think this is doing micro releases.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.440
Right.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.700
Is this one maybe more like full, like the full deal?

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.420
I don't know.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:21.640
Yeah.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.440
I think security releases are, they're slightly different.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.180
We don't actually build binary installers for security releases.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:33.280
We only build source builds, like source tarballs for micro releases.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.880
And so maybe that was the distinction in 102.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.640
Sure.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.160
Okay.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:43.520
So this has existed since 2001, but you got to really dig into it.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.420
And you know, there's some interesting stuff there, but picture a thousand words, all these

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:52.680
things, you put together a really nice graphic here and somehow you got this in like HTML.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.480
I'm impressed.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.300
Yeah.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.560
That's embedded SVG.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.160
I, I always use draw.io for my, my diagrams.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.980
I take pride in my diagrams.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.480
Yeah.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.000
It looks good.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.060
All right.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.600
So there are 10 steps.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.800
Some of the steps have ABCs in them.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:15.360
So, and you know, just for people who pull up this picture and obviously being a podcast,

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.540
it's hard to see the picture.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:22.140
If you're not watching the live stream, I will put a link to the article, which has the picture

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:22.620
in there.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.680
And if I remember right, I'll even put it as the chapter art.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.480
We'll see about that.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.140
Uh, but there's a legend in here.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.440
So you've got like different types of things.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:36.520
You've got human actors, which are golden release artifact, which is blue, a source of risk, which

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.680
is where you're paying extra attention and the start and end state.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:45.100
And so, the colors mean stuff here and the legends at the bottom, but yeah, let's, you

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.480
know, start with number one.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.380
What happens here?

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:47.900
Yeah.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.240
So starting with number one, and I'm actually going to increase the size of my screen as

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.940
well, because I'm going to pull it up separately myself.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.560
Yeah.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.820
There's a lot going on here.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.300
There's a lot going on here.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.940
You need some, you need some manager control plus on it.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.380
Yep.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:02.840
Okay.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.340
All right.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:09.440
So in the very beginning, what happens is essentially the release manager decides it's

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.440
time to make a release.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.200
It'll be common source right now.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.200
So we're, we're deciding, okay, we're going to make a release.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:21.140
And so something that happens even before this is we kind of talk amongst all of the other,

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.860
it says release managers in there, like windows release manager, macOS release manager.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.800
They kind of flip between that language and experts.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.360
So like windows expert, macOS expert.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:34.080
Someone who understands this weird windows things that can make a MSI installer.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.420
The people.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:34.920
Exactly.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.020
What do you do on Mac?

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.320
I don't even know how to build that.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:37.500
Right.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.100
That person.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:38.580
Yeah.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.060
Yeah.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:43.500
Talk to, talk to them, get, get their, get their buy-in that indeed they're going to be

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.480
around when you decide to do this, because this is kind of like a big coordinated thing.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.040
Everyone has to be around to do their part.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.200
And then if that is the case, then the release branch gets frozen.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.600
So in this case, that release branch would be 312.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.820
And so that's done by essentially putting a block on all future like pushes to the branch,

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.620
like in GitHub, you use like branch protection.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:11.380
And that's basically to make it so that no one can merge pull requests anymore so that you

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.040
have something that's stable that you can kind of work off of.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.180
And then after that, you'd move on to step two, which is the actual release manager will

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.120
update their fork of the repo with whatever is on that branch.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:29.320
So like the 312 branch will get updated and then you'll pull that branch locally now on

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.000
step three.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
So now you're on the actual release manager's machine.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:37.360
And so like I kind of have like gray boxes drawn kind of throughout.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.960
So those are kind of like security boundaries a little bit.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:45.160
The top most one is the GitHub like organization of Python.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:51.240
And then the middle, the tiny one that has the fork repo, that's the GitHub user for the

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.320
release manager in particular.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.900
And then the furthest left, the gigantic one is the release manager's actual computer.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.060
It's not documented anywhere.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.920
It's just how I was thinking about it.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.720
But yeah, so then there's this thing called release tool.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.360
And so release tool is basically just a Python script.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.160
It's on GitHub.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:13.980
If you go to github.com/Python slash release dash tool, it's basically just a script that

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:20.620
runs and then does all of the stuff that's needed to build the source distribution and documentation

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.320
of a new Python release.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.760
And so you run that.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:29.520
And as a result, you kind of get like a huge amount of code that needs to be committed.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.500
And so there's a whole bunch of different little tools that kind of get run in addition to

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:33.700
that.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.600
So things like blurb, Sphinx gets run as a part of that.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.280
Yeah, you need a whole lot of dependencies installed.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.200
So you like you need like LaTeX, you need a whole bunch of stuff installed for this to actually

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:45.540
work.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:50.060
Do you make sure you've got like the right, right compiler?

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.440
Is there a lot of concern about that?

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:58.060
Like, is it clang or LLVM or GCC or, you know, I believe it's GCC.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.300
I believe it's GCC.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.760
You know, I didn't dig into that exact point, but I'm pretty sure it is GCC.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.320
But I feel like that's another part that you like that choice matters, right?

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.560
Like you might get different outputs.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.140
You might discover bugs that weren't there.

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:13.020
So you got to kind of get that gray box all set up as well, right?

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:13.840
Yeah, definitely.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:20.600
And so the fact that it's on someone's machine, I would say reproducibility is quite tough in

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.140
those sorts of situations, right?

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:28.500
Like if someone were to build a release of Python and then a day goes by, like I guarantee you

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:34.140
that if you try to do it again with the exact same starting input, it would be potentially

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:34.980
different, right?

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:40.220
And so that's actually a problem from a security perspective for reproducibility, because it means

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:46.000
that someone else can't verify that what you did is correct, right?

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.280
Like the hash might change or something like that, right?

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:53.860
Hashes might change or if there's like somehow the time is getting embedded into a binary

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.140
somewhere like that.

00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:59.720
There's just a whole bunch of different ways that reproducibility could be different between

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.500
two different runs.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.860
Yeah.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:07.120
And so that after the release tool happens, you basically get handed a couple of source

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.260
tarballs that just have everything in them.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.400
And then you also get a bunch of get like changes to the repository.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.360
So these are things like the change log has been generated from all of the blurb notes.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:23.580
And so what you do is then you take all of those changes and you create a big commit that

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:28.460
says this is the release of CPython 3.2, 3.12.0.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.220
And then you tag it and you push that to the fork.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.400
You don't push that to the main repository yet.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.720
And so the reason you don't push that to the main repository, and this is actually something

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:44.400
that this phenomena is, is an interesting one, especially because a lot of security build

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:52.160
tooling doesn't take this work workflow into account, which is you don't push the tag to

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.260
the origin until the very end.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:01.140
A lot of security tooling like salsa and all of these things will kind of like they won't

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:06.140
assume because you can you can do it without tags, but like they'll have features that are

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:12.220
Oh, we'll capture the get tag in the output of like this, like document that says that your

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:15.680
builders came from this repository, this set of tooling, whatever.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.040
Right.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:21.860
But a lot of projects actually wait on the tag until the very end because they want things

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.640
to be repeatable without causing confusion.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.300
So if something went wrong throughout this whole release process, you wouldn't want there to

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.440
be a tag on the main repo that is now confusing people.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:32.880
Right.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.480
Because those tags cause notifications.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.060
I'm going to get the code.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.940
You're like, actually, no, the Mac build wouldn't build.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.540
We're going to fix that or whatever.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:39.880
Right.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.420
Right.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:40.960
Exactly.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:45.420
And so this whole thing is like very it's a common thing.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:50.300
So pip actually has this exact same workflow where they do everything in the release until

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.300
the very end and then they push the tag to the repo because they know that if they push

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.200
that tag and it needs to change, it's going to cause confusion.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.360
So, yeah, that kind of is like step five in there.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.380
It pushes that tag.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:09.460
And so that tag is highlighted red as a source of risk because that is a fork of CPython and

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:16.700
tags tags are not in themselves verifiable because anyone can push a tag.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:22.100
If you if you're just looking at just the name of the tag, anyone can write a tag if you have

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.880
right access to a get repository or a GitHub repository.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:31.160
And so if you push a tag and say someone has access to your account, someone could move that

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.500
tag to a different commit, completely different commit.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:38.420
And if it were pulled in that time and no one decided to like check something else.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:44.060
So like the commit hash, for example, you would be like it would be able to inject code into the

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:44.500
process.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:44.740
Right.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:44.740
Right.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.680
That's as far as we know, that has not happened.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.320
Yeah, that is bad.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.120
It is bad to inject arbitrary.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.080
Someone else's arbitrary code into Python directly.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.300
And it's also it's actually doubly bad because there's there's different degrees of bad in

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.100
term like in supply chain security.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.520
One degree of bad is like if you're able to do bad stuff, but then people notice.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.080
Right.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.000
Or like people can see what happened.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.980
And so this is kind of like degrees of bad of you can inject code and then you can clean

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.260
up after yourself afterwards.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:13.800
Right.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.680
Because you can tag back.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.120
You know, put the tag back.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.140
You have right access.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:17.400
Right.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:22.180
And so that that sort of like put the tag back or being able to circumvent it in that

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.040
way is not good.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.680
Yeah.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.780
Don't give people ideas.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.800
These are not new ideas.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.920
So I feel less bad talking about these.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.320
Yeah.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:38.120
Another thing in this article is actually like tying every step of the release process back

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.500
to a known attack that has succeeded against another project.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:48.540
So like SolarWinds was about build like release artifact poisoning, essentially.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:48.900
Right.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:53.460
You're like taking advantage of the fact that these release artifacts are being distributed

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.560
and, you know, they're signed.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:01.040
Everything looks good, but you've gotten code injected into the actual artifact itself and

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:01.960
it didn't get noticed.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.500
Right.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:07.400
And so like that sort of attack could happen against Python if if there's not mitigations

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:07.820
against it.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:08.000
Right.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.880
And so, yeah, and then the next step is six.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.940
And so at this point, the release manager has sourced tarballs from the result of just

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.940
running the release tool.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.260
And so they're kind of just waiting.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:22.540
They're sitting around waiting for the other experts to to do their thing now.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:28.140
And this is where Windows and macOS installers are actually built.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:33.280
And so these aren't built for security releases, but for 312.0, these will be built.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.960
And they're two completely different sets of build processes.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.760
One of them happens in Azure pipelines.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:46.640
So if you go to that release tool, there's actually like a Windows folder that just has

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.780
100 YAML files in it for all of the different Azure pipeline configurations.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.140
Yeah.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:51.640
Yeah.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.800
Azure pipelines a little bit like GitHub actions.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.520
People who are familiar with that, but not Azure.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:56.980
Right.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.840
Something roughly.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:58.340
Yeah.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:58.540
Yeah.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:58.620
Yeah.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:02.300
And I think there was like a time where Azure pipelines and GitHub actions were like basically

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:02.980
the same thing.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.360
Yeah.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:03.640
Yeah.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.860
Like in the very beginning.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:07.440
Yeah.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.440
So Azure pipelines, there's a whole bunch of stuff that happens there because there's

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.600
Windows embeddable packages is something that gets uploaded to python.org.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.640
Windows installers also get uploaded to python.org.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.200
But that also there's like NuGet gets updated.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.380
The Windows store gets updated there.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.120
So like there's a lot happening there.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:30.600
And there's actually a lot of things that happen that require the actual release manager,

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.300
the Windows release manager to like approve them.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.180
So like they're gated.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.220
These are things like signing keys that are, you know, as a part of the process, you have

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.240
to like sign off to say like, yep, we want to give this job access to the signing key.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:43.960
So that's great.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:49.520
Do you know if Winget is kind of like the newer package manager for Windows?

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.060
Do you know if Python goes there as well these days?

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:52.760
Let's see.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.240
I haven't used Windows in a really long time.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.600
So I don't know.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.840
I do, but I only use it for play games and simple Windows tests.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.360
I don't know.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:01.840
All right.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.820
But yeah, so NuGet is like one of these kinds of package managers for Windows and maybe

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.460
maybe Winget.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.640
People in the audience, if anyone knows, they can let us know.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.400
Yeah, definitely.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.500
I've not even heard of Winget.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.020
So I feel really out of the loop right now.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.520
It's only a couple of years old, I believe.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.660
Gotcha.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.020
Gotcha.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:21.080
And following on with that, those probably won't help you if you don't do a lot of Windows.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:27.740
Lewis asked, does Python maintain Chocolaty, which is similar to Winget, but more independent

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:29.540
than Winget?

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.280
They tried Winget and it was buggy and it wasn't great.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.540
Chocolaty is maybe a little older.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.100
I don't know.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.360
Same story probably, right?

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:35.820
Yeah.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.720
I also don't know.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.200
Unfortunately, Windows is not my strong suit.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.280
Yeah.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.940
Yeah, it's all good.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.920
Definitely a tastier name.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.680
That's how I choose all my tooling is how tasty is the name.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.220
Yeah.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:54.240
And so then the counterpart to that is the macOS binary installers.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.720
And so there's basically just another set of scripts that get run on the macOS release

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.100
manager, like their machine.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:06.040
And it builds just everything having to do with macOS.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.240
It does notarization.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:13.080
It does, you know, making, I know not as much about macOS either, but I know that notarization

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:13.560
happens.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:19.100
And actually I've talked to a few folks about this one too, because this one, if you notice,

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.060
it's just one square and it's just red.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.120
And I was like, yeah, there's a lot more to dig into there.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.120
Yeah.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.840
But yeah, the macOS notarization stuff is a serious pain as well.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.620
Like it's a little bit like submitting something to the iPhone app store where it, you know,

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.120
like gets reviewed and yeah.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:36.620
Yeah.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.600
I think once you have it already notified, you can publish updates.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.120
Cause I was thinking as you were talking about that, like how do you design or deal with the

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:48.720
latency, you know, of like I've submitted it and how long till someone picks it up and

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.120
reviews it?

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:49.600
I don't know.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.800
But I guess once it's kind of approved for notarization, then it, it just goes through

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.260
pretty quickly.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.100
You just set a really long timeout on your CI job.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.120
Like exactly.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.480
Timeout seven weeks.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.280
Give it a week at least.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.440
Yeah.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.440
No.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:10.000
And so then after all of those things kind of happen, there's this stage in, you know,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.700
there's a stop, stop, stop line in the PEP 101 that just basically says for the release

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.640
manager to wait for everyone to be done with their thing.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:22.240
And then once everyone's done with their thing and has uploaded everything to python.org, there's

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.200
basically like this phase of testing everything.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.940
So you, you know, download everything, you make sure everything works on all the operating

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:32.020
systems, the way that's expected to, you don't want to like blow the horn and then realize

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.420
the very last mile that there's something wrong.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.680
And so like lots of testing happens.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.260
And then after the testing happens at that point, then everything that will get uploaded

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:46.940
to python.org or that has been uploaded to python.org gets signed by the release manager in particular

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.280
with sigstore and GPG.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.080
And then from there, all of those signatures get published.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.940
And that is the end of python.org.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.460
All of the artifacts are published.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:02.740
And only then does the release manager, this is step 10, do a git push to the actual upstream

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:03.900
CPython repo.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.200
And at that point, then the branch can be unblocked.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.720
All of these things, the release is done.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.660
Everyone's happy.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.560
We can celebrate.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.980
Yeah, that's kind of the very high level view of what happens.

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.860
Amazing.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.480
A couple of thoughts here.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:25.100
First of all, the Windows square is like tangibly different than the macOS square.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:32.420
The Windows square says, send off some source code to Azure pipelines, a external repeatable

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.640
CI build system.

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.780
Whereas the Mac one is like, build it.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.480
You know what I mean?

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.820
That's actually pretty interesting.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.340
And I don't know that there's an Azure pipeline for macOS, right?

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.500
Like that's just the sort of the story of Mac and servers.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.020
But just highlighting those differences, right?

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:52.340
Like it's a different thing to say, I build on my machine with whatever I got versus I push

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.540
to something like Azure pipeline CI, CD and get some results back.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:56.900
Yeah.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:02.560
Both the source tarball builds and the macOS builds are all local, right?

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.740
And they're not done with a repeatable like CI provider.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:12.380
I was actually able to get like the actual source tarballs to work on GitHub actions.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:18.180
And so that's something that I've worked on and provided that to release managers.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.760
And we're talking about it right now.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:25.180
And macOS is actually, to my knowledge, is actually going to be revamped a little bit

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:28.160
because that tooling has been around for so long.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.700
I think that there's going to be some work done on it.

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:32.560
And so I haven't dug into it as deeply.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.840
I've kind of more just provided a bunch of context to the release managers about things

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.600
that I want to see.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.500
Like if I were to do this myself, this is the other things I'm interested in, right?

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.060
Provided that you actually had access to a macOS system.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:50.960
I'm sure you could do it all from the CLI because, for example, for the Talk Python courses apps,

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.980
we use Flutter and you just say Flutter run.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:59.260
And it compiles that iOS or macOS version somehow through the command line.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:04.760
And then like out comes a thing that is already deployed onto a simulator or something, right?

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.520
So it could happen.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:12.420
I mean, there is some hosting, but it's kind of like, here's your Mac mini in the cloud.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.640
Yeah, I mean, there is a GitHub Action supports macOS.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.440
Does it?

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:17.700
Okay.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:19.560
So possibly, yeah.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.680
Maybe it could happen.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.540
I'm not saying it has to, I'm just, it was kind of a striking difference that one is like

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.720
a CI, CD process and one is local and manual.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.240
Yeah.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:34.600
Actually, Windows is the most repeatable, most like actually isolated from any, from the,

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.180
just the machine itself, right?

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.320
The release manager themselves.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.260
So, yeah.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.360
Yeah, that's pretty interesting.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.020
And then we have binaries and they get published and everybody is happy.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.100
We all go and install it.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.420
And it's been in testing for quite a while, right?

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.900
Like we've had a bunch of betas.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:49.620
We had alphas.

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:54.460
We have had three release candidates and on Monday we'll have a dot zero.

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.240
It's exciting.

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.100
It's really exciting.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:57.120
It is exciting.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:02.660
The other question I would ask you is like, what is the time from like step one to step

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.020
10?

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.300
How much clock time has passed?

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:05.860
Wall time.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:10.920
I would say that it is on, it's on the scale of hours.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:15.020
It's not like a day, which is kind of incredible, right?

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:21.080
The fact that you get three volunteers together to do a bunch of all of this stuff.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.660
And it only takes a couple hours.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.700
It obviously depends on how many problems you run into on the way, because if you like get

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.320
to the very end and then there's a problem that you find in testing, like you have to kind

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:38.000
of start over, but yeah, if everything goes to plan, which has happened, I've coordinated security.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.920
Like there was a couple of security fixes that were in 3.115 that I coordinated.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:49.060
And yeah, I got to kind of witness the, okay, we've decided we're making a security release to the actual.

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:49.940
It's out there.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.520
We can now talk about the vulnerabilities.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.460
Yeah.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.280
Was that the int parsing thing?

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.940
It was the, what was it?

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.420
There was an int parsing, or was it int parsing?

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.380
No, it wasn't int parsing.

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:02.360
Really long ints.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:02.880
I don't know.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.840
No, that's a different one.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:09.480
No, it was, there was a TLS, and this one sounds really scary.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.680
It's not as scary.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:16.220
It's a TLS bypass on the server side.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:23.800
So like if the client is supposed to be authenticated, for example, if you're using MTLS, you can,

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:30.080
if you like send a handshake and then immediately close your socket, you can get lucky during like a,

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:35.980
a brief period of time where the socket on the other side, like the server socket will say like,

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.180
oh, it's closed.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.140
So it's fine.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:38.460
Right.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:45.160
And the data that whatever you sent over the wire won't, will still be readable, but then the

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.780
handshake hasn't actually like completed.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.580
And so that sounds like scary, right?

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:56.240
But it's, it's, it's actually not as bad because so many protocols, well, for one, so many protocols

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.940
don't even use client authentication at all.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.800
So that's one huge point.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:07.240
The other side of it is that all protocols that people do end up using like mutual TLS with

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:13.860
are protocols that like, you have to like send something back to, so like HTTP, for example,

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.700
you have to send something back.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.780
And at that point the socket is closed.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:20.180
And so it can't send the data back.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.620
So there's like no data exfiltration.

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:26.880
It's a pretty narrow scope of like what's actually vulnerable.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:31.520
But yes, the, the, the fix for that vulnerability is in 3.11.5.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.020
And there's another one too, but it's, it's a little bit more minor.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:39.260
Well, we'll start fresh with 3.12 and hopefully you will not have to witness one of these releases.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.940
Honestly, they're given how large CPython is and how wide ranging it, its standard library

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:45.680
attempts to be.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.240
It's, it does not have many vulnerabilities.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.480
I mean, you go look at like a web browser upgrade.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:55.300
It's like, here's the 27, like remote code execution vulnerability.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:59.180
Maybe not quite that many, but here's the 27 security fixes this month.

00:49:59.180 --> 00:49:59.620
You know?

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:00.100
Yeah.

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.000
We've maybe, maybe it's a little more front of mind right now.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.740
Now that like Chrome is on their fifth zero day of the week, but yeah, it's, it's pretty

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.140
tough week for Chrome right now.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:09.380
Yeah.

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.100
And Firefox and the rest of us.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:11.640
Yeah.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.880
Yeah, for sure.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:19.280
Uh, let's see another, another comment from Frank says six door and GPG seem a bit at the

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.180
end of the process.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:25.180
Considering these are billed locally in some cases, how does one guarantee of the sign sources

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.240
are still right?

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:27.140
Yeah.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.280
So this is kind of getting to the, like, I agree with you.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.320
How, how does one, how does one track that they're still right?

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:39.500
Um, so they, they get uploaded to python.org and at that point they're kind of like in a

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.660
holding pattern for testing.

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.300
And so those binaries are there, they're on python.org.

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.280
They've got, you know, the hashes have already been taken.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.960
Um, then the testing is happens.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:53.680
So like anything that happens between that and the six or starting, like, yeah, at that point

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.640
it's kind of protected, but yeah, there is this really big dwell time.

00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:02.900
Where you just have artifacts sitting on someone's machine and they're going to get signed and

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:03.660
sent out the door.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.840
And that's kind of like the due diligence of release managers.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.460
They need to make sure that those are the right artifacts that they've been tested properly,

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:14.160
that the ones that you tested locally are the ones that are going to get ended up being

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:14.660
signed.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.960
Um, yeah.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:21.160
And so this is something, this is like a, a piece of the whole puzzle that gets mitigated

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:26.440
by having those builds happen on external services, as opposed to on someone's local machine.

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.360
Because at that point you're just giving, yeah.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:28.760
Yeah.

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.520
You're just giving this like set of scripts, like very, very narrow set of input.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:38.180
Like I want this exact get commit and this version number to get built.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:42.920
And then out pops like a tar ball that's already been signed and verified and everything.

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.420
And then from there, you just put that on python.org.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:45.700
Right.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.920
Like that, that is a lot less.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.860
Um, there's a lot less of that risk where it's just on someone's machine.

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.540
And how, how do, how does one know that that is the exact thing that they built?

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:56.720
It's, it's not provable.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.200
Yeah.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.500
What about virtual machines for these gray boxes?

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:02.400
I mean, obviously the Azure one, that's, that's its own thing.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:09.300
But have you considered like a, a Docker or an official just RLLs VM and go like, here,

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.100
take this, run that.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:11.740
You know what I mean?

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:13.120
Um, yeah.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:17.400
To make it a little less dependent on the person whose role it is that year.

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:21.740
It definitely would help with the reproducibility side of things because as we know,

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.240
Docker is just the whole machine shipped in a box.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:24.480
Right.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.000
Yeah.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.440
Um, so yeah, in, in theory, if you build the same thing again, in that exact same image,

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.420
you would end up getting a pretty similar result.

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.800
So it helps on that front, which, which is good.

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:38.140
Uh, I think the, the tough thing is, is that you don't, you still don't have control of the

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.880
inputs and the output.

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:44.460
You also still don't have like this, like it comes out of the Docker container.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.260
You get a tar ball.

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:49.480
There's still that time in between when the tar ball is out of the container and when it's

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:54.360
actually on python.org where it's on someone's machine that is not in a container.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:53:00.020
Um, and containers also aren't the best in terms of like, you, you did mention virtual

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:07.120
machines as well, but even, even that like on a machine that is a high value target,

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.620
you know, maybe it's worth it.

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.000
Who knows?

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:09.600
Yeah.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.120
Yeah.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:10.480
Who knows?

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.140
All right.

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:15.360
Well, it's pretty interesting and, it's, it's happening Monday.

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.880
So very exciting.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.980
And I'm, I'm looking forward to all the new work.

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:24.500
I mean, are there new features in three 12 that are you particularly excited about?

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:30.420
You know, I, since being in this role, I actually haven't been paying attention to Python releases

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.300
as much Python features as much.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.560
I'm, I'm mostly excited about it getting faster.

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:37.160
I mean, the generic, it's just straight up faster.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.120
Like there's no one on the planet that's not happy about that.

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.260
Um, what are the major features this, this release?

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.380
So there's like a, some more broad F string thing.

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:49.680
So you used to be able to have a subset of the language in the F string.

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.720
And now you can kind of like program in the F string.

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:55.980
I believe, type statement is better generic types.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:56.300
Yeah.

00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:00.660
There's like a, a simpler way to express generics and the type system.

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:05.480
And then I'm with you, you know, honestly, like f-strings being nicer.

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.280
That's awesome.

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.140
Thanks for that.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.980
But faster, faster, faster is good.

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:14.080
Uh, this per interpreter GIL is kind of part of that faster CPython thing, right?

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.760
Like it's hard to leverage, but if you could just say in your threads, new interpreter for

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:19.720
this bit, right?

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:23.540
All of a sudden you escape the GIL for computational stuff.

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:24.400
That'd be pretty interesting.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.860
Um, but you know, also this, this is another interesting thing.

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:31.300
If you pull up this list, like the size of the scroll bar, I don't know.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.500
We were talking about scary scroll bars earlier.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.360
Like this is next level.

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:36.120
Let me see.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.140
I'm going to, I'll throw this into omnivore.

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.480
Are you a fan of omnivore?

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.140
This app?

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:40.880
Omnivore.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:41.860
Never heard of it.

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:42.540
What is it?

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.020
Omnivore.app.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:46.060
Kind of a Instapaper pocket replacement.

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:47.160
Oh, I'm already logged into it.

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:47.540
Look at that.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:49.660
Oh, super, super cool.

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:52.280
So I go here and you say add a link.

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.120
Actually, it just, I think it just went in there.

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:54.520
Let's see.

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.640
40 minutes just to read that what's new.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.360
That's what I was trying to pull.

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.840
Oh, it just, yeah.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.040
It calculates that for you.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.760
It's like, it's going to take a while.

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.740
So just a sense of like, what is new in Python 3.12?

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:08.760
That's a ton, right?

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:09.200
Yeah.

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:13.700
A ton of stuff, like tons of fixes, tons of fixes and improvements.

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:17.720
Mike, people are out in the audience says, Python dash M SQLite 3 is nifty.

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:19.800
Mike, you're going to have to tell me more about this.

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.800
Does that, does that open up a database now?

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.740
That would be lovely.

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:24.320
Yeah.

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.260
That would be cool.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.700
Kind of like the HTTP server.

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.360
Yes.

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.000
Yeah.

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:29.260
With the JSON tool.

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.100
The JSON tool is the one I use the most.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:31.960
What's that one do?

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:35.120
So you can like pipe JSON into it and it'll just make it pretty.

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.980
It's pretty, it's questionable how useful it is, but it sure does make pretty JSON.

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:40.620
Yeah.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.640
Which I, I really appreciate.

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.980
Like two, two space indented JSON.

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:46.520
That is, that's perfect.

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.140
Indeed.

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:47.620
All right.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:50.620
One more comment from the audience and then we'll maybe wrap it up.

00:55:50.620 --> 00:56:01.920
Karen says, let me, she's clarifying above like VM Docker for less, less changes and better reproducibility.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:10.020
Um, VM Docker for less heterogeneity reproducibility than the current situation, which is affected by a given user's environment.

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:10.260
Yeah.

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:15.480
Like what web browser did you install today or something completely unrelated or, you know,

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:23.360
or like you upgrade, if it's your personal machine and you're using tools, like if you upgrade those tools, it could pull some other system dependency.

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:23.640
Right.

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:31.560
That ends up being relevant to the build of CPython and yeah, it's just, there's just so much that could be different over the course of even a few days.

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.100
Yeah.

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:32.640
Yeah.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.980
Which is why it's interesting that the windows one goes to Azure pipelines.

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.500
Cause it kind of pulls, puts that to the side, right?

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:39.920
Yeah.

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.760
All right, Seth.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:46.500
Well, this has been super, super interesting and thanks for giving us a look into this world.

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.580
So yeah, very, very excellent.

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.360
And I guess, you know, final two questions.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.600
You can write some Python code.

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.080
What editor using these days?

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.360
Oh yeah.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.440
I'm using PyCharm.

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.520
I, I love PyCharm specifically.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.900
You know, the, I, I have the, what is it?

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:07.700
I had the professional edition for a good long while and then I let that subscription lapse and I need to just redo it.

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:11.780
But so I'm using the community edition right now, but yeah, I love PyCharm so much.

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:12.920
So really good editor.

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:13.560
Awesome.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.220
I'm there with you.

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:20.340
And then notable pipe I package, something that I already talked about these.

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.500
I, so pip audit, just use pip audit.

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.460
There's so much work happening somewhere.

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:30.220
With pip audit that it, it just makes sense for you to use it because there's just a ton of work happening.

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:36.560
And if you just add it to your workflow, you'll just know that things are vulnerable or like what's vulnerable and like what versions you should update to.

00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:37.060
Yeah.

00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:44.280
I already have some tooling that like some aliases that do three or four steps to actually update my dependencies and install them.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:49.000
Like I might as well just throw this as like another and, and pip audit.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:49.500
Yeah.

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:58.120
And you can actually, so you can, I think there's a way that you can tell pip audit to install packages, but then it will like say something.

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.960
If there is a vulnerability in whatever you're installing.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:01.360
Right.

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.000
So like you can even replace like use pip audit.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.440
I think that that is a feature.

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:07.200
All right.

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:07.840
I think so.

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.040
It has a features thing.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.600
Let me look at it.

00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.580
Oh, let's see it.

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:12.460
Oh, it's not going to work because it's not the read me.

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.360
It's true.

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.160
I got to, got to go to the homepage, which will take some here.

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:17.960
So I got to go to the source.

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.100
No, where's the GitHub?

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.300
Let me go to the stars.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:22.880
All right.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:23.200
You know what?

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.680
Maybe I don't want to click this thing.

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.240
Features.

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:25.900
There we go.

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.140
Multiple emitting.

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:31.800
We haven't talked about S bombs, but seamlessly reusing.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.740
Yeah.

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:36.540
If it reuses the pip caches, maybe, maybe, maybe.

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:37.060
All right.

00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.580
I'll play with it.

00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:38.940
We'll see.

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:39.880
People can check it out.

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:40.880
Citation needed.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.020
Citation needed.

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:42.980
Exactly.

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:43.840
Citation needed.

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:44.300
That's right.

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:44.920
All right.

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:45.960
Well, yeah.

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.000
People check out pip audit.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:47.940
That looks excellent.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:49.240
And yeah.

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.020
Final call to action.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.580
People are interested in this.

00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:57.080
I mean, give a thought to it on Monday, theoretically, at least in the past, if you've listened too

00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.140
far in the future, but you know, the next release.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:58:59.780
Yeah.

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:04.440
No, I, I think the biggest, so in terms of like, what can you personally do?

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:08.120
Because like, there's just, I just talked about so much stuff that is just kind of happening

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.580
in the background, but there's also stuff that like individual people can do.

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:17.920
And the most impactful URL that you can visit for security, if you're an open source consumer

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.260
or like a maintainer, like it doesn't matter.

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.460
This is just going to be impactful.

00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:26.480
If you work in software is best.openssf.org.

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.980
So that is basically just like a webpage and it just has a few URLs and you click into

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:36.460
any of those URLs and it's just gives you like a checklist of here's things to think

00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:36.720
about.

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:40.400
Here's, and then if you click into those checklist items, it gives you, it's kind of like this

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:46.140
recursive, nice, like guiding force of like, here's the things you could be doing.

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.600
Right.

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:50.900
And if you want to dig in more concise guide for developing more secure software, in other

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:54.220
words, NPM best practices and so on.

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:54.440
Yeah.

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:54.900
Excellent.

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:55.540
Yeah.

00:59:55.540 --> 01:00:00.780
I'm hoping to put a like Python best practices guide there by the end of my, by the end of

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.220
the, the year that I'm here.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.400
So don't you worry.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.080
Look forward to that.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.080
Excellent.

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:05.900
I'll be right there.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.140
We'll get it above on the, on the list.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:08.800
Yeah.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.460
It'll, it'll somehow not sort alphabetically and it'll be okay.

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.920
Tip the scales a little bit.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.240
Cool.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.860
Well, thank you for being here, Seth.

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:19.360
Thank you.
