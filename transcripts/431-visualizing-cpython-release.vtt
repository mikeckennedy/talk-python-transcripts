00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Every year Python has a new major release. This year it's Python 3.12 and it'll come out on


00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.280
October 2nd, 2023. That's four days from when this episode was published. There is quite a process


00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.640
involved to test build and ship Python across the many platforms and channels. We have Seth Michael


00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.760
Larson here to give us a detailed rundown on exactly what is involved in releasing CPython.


00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.360
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 431, recorded September 28th, 2023.


00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:44.400
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python. This is your host, Michael Kennedy.


00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.600
Follow me on Mastodon, where I'm @mkennedy, and follow the podcast using @talkpython,


00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.600
both on fosstodon.org. Be careful with impersonating accounts on other instances, there are many.


00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.320

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.280
Hey there, before we jump into talking about building CPython, I have a new course to tell


00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.600
you about HTML plus Django full web apps hold the JavaScript. This is an excellent new Django


00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.240
course written by Christopher Trudeau. In just a few hours, you'll learn how to make your app


00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.320
much more interactive in the code even a little cleaner than pure Django.


00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.880
You may be familiar with our HTMX plus Flask course I released a while ago, and this one is


00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.560
its Django sister course. And it is out now at talkpython.fm/htmx-django. The link is in your


00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.440
show notes. If you Django and have been wanting to adopt HTMX, you should definitely give this


00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.480
course a look. And a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has purchased one of our courses


00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.360
or library bundles. It truly makes this show possible. Now on to that interview.


00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.900
Hey all.


00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.400
Hey Seth.


00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.300
Hello.


00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.740
Awesome to have you here on the show.


00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.140
Yeah.


00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.940
Thanks for having me.


00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.700
Absolutely.


00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.460
I'm looking forward to talking about the details, the steps of releasing CPython.


00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.320
And for those of you who have not been watching and paying attention by the


00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.380
time this comes out, it'll probably have already happened.


00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.720
I'm sure it's already happened by the time this video is up,


00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.520
though, it's not quite happening.


00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.660
So as of the recording next Monday, this whole process that we're going to


00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.620
going to talk about goes into action, right?


00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.340
Releasing Python 3.11.


00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.820
Yeah.


00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.340
This, or not 3.12.


00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.460
This will have happened.


00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.460
3.12.


00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.940
I got to get used to it.


00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.020
It's like the, you know, in January, all you always write the, the, the year


00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.340
wrong out, so 3.12, the new version, the still faster, faster C Python 3.12


00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.980
with lots of cool features is going to be out and how does that happen?


00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.300
Right?


00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.140
There's, there's a lot going on behind the scenes and you wrote a really cool


00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.900
blog post called visualizing the CPython release process or something like that.


00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.780
I'm getting off memory and has a great diagram with a whole bunch of boxes.


00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.860
And so we're going to go through and kind of just talk about how


00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.360
that happens and so on, but before we get into it, maybe a quick intro


00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.860
for folks who don't know you yet.


00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.420
Yeah.


00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.700
So I'm, I'm Seth Larson, online everywhere.


00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.020
I am Seth M Larson.


00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.740
That's my handle.


00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.860
And I am the security developer in residence at the Python software


00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.180
foundation, the inaugural security developer in residence.


00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.380
but hopeful for more, obviously.


00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.580
But yeah, this whole role is funded through


00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.300
the OpenSSF Alpha Omega project specifically,


00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.840
and it's kind of a project that's focusing on


00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.340
Alpha being really, really important projects


00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.780
that everyone agrees, yep,


00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.460
that's a really important project to secure.


00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.840
So among them is Python and PyPI.


00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.440
And then Omega is kind of like the long tail, right?


00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.980
Like all the other projects,


00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.540
'cause there's open source is huge,


00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.300
there's millions of different projects.


00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.040
How can we secure those?


00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.400
And so, yeah, this role exists because of them.


00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.480
So I'm very thankful.


00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.760
And it's mostly-- - As are we all, right?


00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.980
Speaking for the community.


00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.420
This has been something-- - Yeah.


00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.160
- There's been a lot of places where it's like,


00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.760
well, why doesn't someone take care of this?


00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.440
Like, well, there's nobody's whose sole job it is.


00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.240
But like Python has been slowly rolling in these new roles,


00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.080
which is fantastic.


00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.740
Like Lukas Lange at the developer in residence,


00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.560
you're the security developer in residence.


00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.280
We have Mike Fiedler, who I spoke to about on PyPI security.


00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.360
Like there's people, there's developers working on stuff.


00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.860
awesome.


00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.480
There's something to be said, like having having someone working on stuff full


00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.980
time, like you can, you can get a lot done.


00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.560
It's, it's, it's quite nice.


00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.760
Like, cause we're so used to, you know, how, how the speed of open source, right.


00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.640
Which is not, I guess when someone says the speed of open source, they don't


00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.560
immediately think, oh yeah, that's going to be, that's going to be fast and snappy


00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.960
because people have lives.


00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.320
Yeah.


00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.160
Well, sometimes it is when, when things are brand new, they, they, they can have a


00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.120
lot of momentum.


00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.440
But I know my personal view is like on all these software projects, there's these


00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.660
little gnarly edges that is just as fun for no one.


00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.160
Right.


00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.380
And like, I want to add this new feature or I want to add async to this


00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.060
thing so people can do this and like, you can get so inspired, even if it's


00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.880
not your job and it's just your project and really go on it, but like, you


00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.120
know, really polishing out that little bit of documentation or, or updating


00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.880
that detour, like it's, it's all the, the fine polish, I guess, that I think


00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.920
you all are bringing to Python, which is awesome.


00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.320
Yeah.


00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.960
there's tons of work that's like, it really does need that amount of time


00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.520
investment and like a sustained time investment.


00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.120
So like when you're working with external groups or like, you know,


00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.840
developing processes and stuff like that, like you just need, you just need to be


00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.000
there a lot more than, you know, weekends.


00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.560
So it's good to have that full time presence.


00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.120
Yeah.


00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.800
Yeah.


00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.800
I think it is too, although it's absolutely mind blowing how much stuff gets


00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.800
done in traditional pure open source.


00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.880
It really is.


00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.360
Honestly, it gives a whole new perspective to it, right?


00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.480
-It's like, okay, you know, all of this is happening, -Yeah.


00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.600
but, you know, almost all of the people that I interact with on a day-to-day basis


00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.880
are volunteers.


00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.880
And so, like, I kind of wrote about this a little bit in my opening


00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.960
when I announced myself as a security developer in Resonance, but


00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.760
it's like, you need to, you can't have


00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.960
expectations and, like, assign people work, you know what I mean?


00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.960
Like, this is not a traditional work environment


00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.960
where you can just tell people what to do


00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.560
And, you know, it's a certain way of working.


00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.060
And I'm used to it because I am an open source maintainer myself.


00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.360
So it makes a lot of sense to me and I feel very comfortable with it.


00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.760
But it's very different than a regular security developer job would be.


00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.760
Would you say fewer TPS reports?


00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.960
Yeah, a few fewer. Yeah, yeah.


00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.260
Just a couple fewer.


00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.360
Hey, since you brought it up, maybe we'll come back to this if we have time at the end.


00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.160
But, you know, you've got some pretty notable projects that you're working on here.


00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.960
Like give a quick shout out to some of your open source work that predates.


00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.600
Yeah.


00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.240
So I am the lead maintainer of your lib three, which is one of the most downloaded


00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.000
Python packages on PyPI.


00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.080
I also help maintain requests.


00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.720
It's a user of your lib three.


00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.720
And then in addition to that, I have a library, which I quite love, which is called trustor,


00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.600
which is being adopted by a lot of package managers right now, like pip and conda and


00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:32.660
and PDM, which allows those packages to use system certificates as opposed to something


00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.200
like certify, so that you can take advantage of all of the benefits that you get for using


00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.700
a system trust store for HTTPS, as opposed to like a static bundle of certificates, because


00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.180
operating systems are actually constantly checking, updating all of these things.


00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.180
It's just a little bit better.


00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.840
>> Some certificate store or some certificate authority turns out to be shady and they get


00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.840
revoked and...


00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.400
Yeah, or just not have the best practices.


00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.200
And so, yeah, just like, okay, we're going to pull that one.


00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.200
But pulling a certain...


00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.000
Yeah, they even get stolen, right?


00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Sometimes these certificates get stolen.


00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.840
They get stolen, you know, there's all sorts of things that can go wrong.


00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.840
Thankfully, it doesn't go wrong very often.


00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.920
Otherwise, it would be a lot bigger of a problem.


00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.120
But yeah, it does happen every once in a while.


00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.920
Yeah, that's cool.


00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.920
Yeah, and you were on Python Bytes,


00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.440
my other podcast I do with Brian, to talk about Trust Store, which is cool.


00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.440
All right, but back to this.


00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.000
So tell us a bit about this developer, security developer in residence role.


00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.120
Like people were like, Oh, this maybe they've heard of it or is maybe even new to them.


00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.320
But like, what is your, what is your job here in the PSF space?


00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:44.880
Yeah, it's, it's, it's kind of funny talking about my role too, because people see security through so many different lenses.


00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.920
And this is even like outside of talking to people online that are in the open source space.


00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.640
So whenever I talk about this job, people will say, Oh, so you do it security for the PSF? I'm


00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.160
like, Well, no, I don't do that. And then they'll say, Oh, so you secure? Yeah, right? I'm in.


00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.200
Right? No, no, no. So I don't do that. I don't do it security for the PSF. And then they the


00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.080
next question they usually ask is like, Oh, so you make it so that Python is more secure, like the


00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.680
code of Python is more secure. And I'm like, not really, honestly, I don't do that either.


00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:25.040
And what I really do is try my best to make it so that bad stuff doesn't happen to Python users.


00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.400
And so, you know, obviously those things are important, like securing Python, the actual code


00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:36.160
itself. But on, like, the scale factor, maybe those are a little bit less important than some


00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.920
things like making sure that when you download something from Python.org, it is the correct


00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.080
thing. Making sure that when a release is happening for Python, nothing can subvert


00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.160
that release and get injected in and then distributed to everyone. And then it goes


00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.120
beyond Python when you start thinking about the packaging space. So making sure that hip


00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:04.240
release process is good. Making sure that all of these tools and stuff that are using all of these


00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:11.040
binary libraries, how can you be sure that those libraries that are bundled along with them don't


00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.900
don't have vulnerabilities. And then a lot of things around process. So vulnerability


00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.880
management and making sure that vulnerabilities that are discovered in Python and reported


00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.600
to us, they actually get to the end of the process where they're fixed and released.


00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.440
There's just a whole bunch of things like that where it's more of a scale and safety


00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.980
and making sure that my effort goes towards things that are going to keep on churning


00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:39.920
as opposed to things that are like spot fixes. Because spot fixes, they're important, but


00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.320
they don't have the scale and they don't have that, like, keep on giving you the value aspect


00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.320
of them.


00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.320
Yeah.


00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.740
And the consequence of a lot of what you described sounds like supply chain type issues.


00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.180
The consequence of that is so bad.


00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:59.140
It doesn't matter how patched your computer is or how good your firewall is.


00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.380
If CPython itself ships with a virus, right?


00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.380
Right.


00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.380
Yeah.


00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.380
Or somebody snuck it in right at the builds.


00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.380
Yeah.


00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.380
Yeah.


00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.380
Right.


00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.380
Right.


00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.220
Nobody wants that.


00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.940
Well, almost nobody wants that.


00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.920
- Very few people want this, so.


00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.760
- Those are not good people.


00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.600
We don't want them to want this.


00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.620
- Yeah, we don't take them into consideration


00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.460
for their use cases.


00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.380
- We sure don't.


00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.220
Awesome.


00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.400
And let's see, I believe you're on,


00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.120
well, when I read the article, you're on week nine.


00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.340
So you're on week 10.


00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.820
Is that where we are?


00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.500
- I think I'm on week 12 at this point.


00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.660
- Oh man, time flies.


00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.500
- Yeah, I know.


00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.280
I'm actually drafting up like a quarterly review


00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.780
and it's a big thing, so yeah.


00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.620
- Okay.


00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.560
A quick question from the audience here on the live stream, you know,


00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.720
Louis asks, is there a visibility or will there be a public visibility


00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.620
for CVEs in packages?


00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.420
That is an excellent question.


00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.380
It is a good question.


00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.860
And I bring this up because didn't the PSF just get certified as like a CVE


00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.460
authority or whatever that is like ability to create CVEs.


00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.100
I don't know.


00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.300
Yeah, I can, I can talk so much about this, right?


00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.520
So there, there's a whole bunch of stuff happening in that space.


00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.360
So the, the, I'll start off with stuff that I did not personally do, but


00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.560
I'm helping maintain now.


00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.260
which is there is an advisory database called,


00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.260
if you go on GitHub, it's github.com/pypa/advisorydatabase


00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.380
with a dash in between advisory and database.


00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.260
And that database is essentially trying to categorize


00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.700
all of the CVEs and what versions they affect


00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.980
for every single package on the Python package index,


00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.720
which is an impossible task,


00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.220
but so we're trying our best there.


00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.620
But yeah, so one of the packages, no problem.


00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.580
No problem, right? Like that's a manual task right there.


00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.380
Yeah, no. So what this actually does is for the bulk of it,


00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:52.140
what it will do is it'll go out and it'll pull the CVE feed from NBD and Miter,


00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:59.900
and it will parse it and try to find references to Python packages and versions inside of CVEs.


00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.140
So obviously that's sometimes there's false positives,


00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.020
but a lot of the times there's just, it just works out okay.


00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.020
And there's a little bit of triage involved.


00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.660
There's a little bit of manual submission of this too.


00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.860
But yeah, so tools like pip audit,


00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.060
which is a tool that I love so much,


00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.340
uses this database in addition to other scanning tools.


00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.140
Like any scanning tool can use this database.


00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.180
But yeah, this is the canonical location for vulnerabilities affecting Python packages.


00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.180
So for Python itself,


00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.380
the Python Software Foundation just recently, like


00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:40.060
a few weeks ago announced that we are now a CVE numbering authority, which means that we are,


00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.940
we kind of have like a scope of just Python and pip right now. So those are the only two projects


00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:50.620
that we're emitting CVEs for. And what that means we can do is it means that people have to submit


00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.420
reports to us, which is good, because then they can't submit them to other places and get CVS


00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.260
that way can be kind of frustrating, because in the past, sometimes that would happen. And then


00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
And we wouldn't know about the vulnerability until it got published as a CVE.


00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.260
And we'd be like, what just happened?


00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.260
>> We have a CVE?


00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.260
Like, what?


00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.260
>> Yeah, right.


00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.460
>> Like, one of the big deals is you're supposed to be told, in an ideal world, you're supposed


00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.860
to be given like a, come knock on the back door, like, that WebP code.


00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.020
We need to talk about the WebP code before.


00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.020
>> Yeah.


00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.020
Oh, gosh.


00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.020
Don't get me started on WebP.


00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.100
Don't get me started on WebP.


00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.460

for three months free.


00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.960
PyCharm, it's how I get work done.


00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.700
- The real, like the ideal process


00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.660
is someone would Google like Python and security


00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.700
or like Python and report a vulnerability.


00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.860
And then they would find these like really lovely


00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.740
instructions that someone else wrote up to say,


00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.100
just send an email to security@python.org


00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.340
with whatever information you have.


00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.900
And then we triage that.


00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.680
And if we decided it's a vulnerability,


00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.940
we would ask for a CVE on your behalf


00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.100
and like credit you and all this stuff and then fix it.


00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.260
And then the release and publication of the CVE


00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.540
would happen at the same time.


00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.560
So that's what we call coordinated vulnerability disclosure.


00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.580
And so instead of like, oh, there's a vulnerability,


00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.500
but there's no fix available for that vulnerability.


00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.460
Like that's what you want to avoid


00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.380
because it causes panic.


00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.140
And in theory, it could cause exposure, right?


00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.700
Where there's some dwell time in between when people,


00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.140
or it doesn't minimize the dwell time


00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.920
between when people are able to patch


00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.940
and when the vulnerability is known to potential attackers.


00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.500
- Right, there's already a latency


00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.420
from when it's announced to somebody actually fixing it.


00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.580
But if when you hear it,


00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.460
you can't actually fix it for two more weeks


00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.280
'cause it's not released.


00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:20.120
That just gives people two weeks to try to dissect like what exactly do they mean by there's this image problem?


00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.760
Exactly. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah


00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:30.280
We're gonna start talking about libwebp actually. Yeah, the no, i'm just using it like it's the most recent example because last night there was a


00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.160
And really relevant to cvs because there was some drama that apple patched


00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.560
Some of their code when google announced it


00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.480
It looked like it was only applied to chrome


00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.120
but it actually applied to anything that used WebP, which looking at the updates is like everything


00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:49.560
on my computer needs to be updated because of it. You know, like that, that mismatch was like


00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:56.280
caused a lot of drama. I definitely agree. Yeah. There was like a week of time in between,


00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.560
when that CVE just mentioned Chrome and Apple. And then when it actually ended up mentioning


00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.120
LibWebP and then right when it mentioned LibWebP, I'm like, Oh, I know a lot of Python packages use


00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.760
And so I then went out and go and talk to those people.


00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.060
Okay.


00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.400
And they fixed those things now.


00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.600
So, yeah, that's great.


00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.400
Another good reason to stay on top of dependency management and stuff, right?


00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.180
Like tools.


00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:22.440
One of the things I think we're coming to sort of understand and manage better in


00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.180
the Python space is not your dependencies, but the transitive


00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.680
closure of your dependencies.


00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.200
Right.


00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.620
So I might use, let me just say, I guess, what if I use pillow to work with images,


00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.060
images, but Pillow itself uses some other library that it pip installs that


00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.320
itself might have some kind of image code.


00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.680
If I say I use Pillow, oh, I need to update it.


00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:47.340
PIP install dash dash upgrade Pillow doesn't upgrade its, its dependencies


00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.220
and those dependencies of the right.


00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.180
So like, but that could be where a lot of silence issues live.


00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.020
And so things like Poetry, Flit, pip-tools, there's a lot of tools coming


00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:01.140
on that I think are gaining popularity that treat not just what you directly


00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.420
wanted a pip install, but it's friends and it's dependencies.


00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.260
- Yeah, definitely.


00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.100
- What's your thought about that


00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.620
from a security perspective?


00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.300
- Yes, so having the most important thing


00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.820
from like a kind of dependency management side of things


00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.420
is having those lock files and having them have hashes.


00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.220
Like it's less of a problem now.


00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.020
Like it likely won't come to fruition


00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.620
that those hashes end up being important,


00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.540
but luckily lots of lock file formats


00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.500
do generate hashes anyways, which is great.


00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.980
So that subverts attacks against PyPI partially.


00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.120
- Right in the middle, DNS madness.


00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.960
- Right, yeah.


00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.120
Like if somehow you've been tricked


00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.480
into using a bad certificate or something, right?


00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.860
Like it saves you from a lot of stuff like that.


00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.100
So having hashes, they're basically free.


00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.200
They're great, just use those.


00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.540
The other side of it is running a vulnerability checker


00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.080
against those dependencies.


00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.800
'Cause then you'll, or either that


00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.680
or having a tool that's doing that for you.


00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.080
So like Dependabot is a tool that does that for you.


00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.880
It will check vulnerability databases


00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.380
and then give you like a security notification


00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.860
or a PR to say, hey, this is affected


00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.220
by a medium severity vulnerability


00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.840
or you can run them your own via pip audit


00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.180
with it can either check an already installed environment


00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.380
or it can check like a requirements file.


00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.900
I don't know the full extent


00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.860
of all the different file types that it can check.


00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.000
I know that it works on requirements.txt,


00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.320
but yeah, it'll check those files for known vulnerabilities


00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.040
all of the transitive dependencies, just everything that's available. And then from there, it'll tell


00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.840
you, hey, these are the things that you need to fix here, the fixed versions, like try upgrading


00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.400
to at least this doesn't mean that it's easy. It does go back to that advisory database you


00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:47.800
talked about? It does go back to that advisory database. Yeah. And it also can hook into osv.dev,


00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:54.120
which is kind of like this global aggregation of tons of different vulnerability databases.


00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:59.240
So for example, we have one for Python that I pointed out, but then like Rust has one,


00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.560
Debian has one, what is it?


00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.160
Rocky Linux, I think has one, like there's just a whole bunch of them.


00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.440
And you can kind of interface with this database using the same API.


00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.560
And it's kind of nice.


00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.600
- Yeah.


00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.800
So making this the security show, we just talked to Mike Fiedler a little while ago


00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.880
about that as well, diving into it.


00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.840
I mean, we'll come back to the release process, but I do want to ask you about this is


00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.840
One of the challenges I see is like, I got to depend about a warning.


00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.640
Luckily, it was for basically the requirements-dev side,


00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.040
not the true requirement.


00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.540
You know, like I'm going to use a bunch more tools to do like Jupyter stuff on my data,


00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.140
but I'm really just running a website and there's like a much smaller,


00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.540
well, a smaller set of things on there.


00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.240
But there was a vulnerability report for something,


00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:49.140
some package that was in my requirements for the dev verge, the dev setup.


00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.720
However, when I tried to go update it, one other package that is the reason that was


00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.180
there said, no, it has to be less than something.


00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.200
And that something was less than the fix.


00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.980
And I'm like, how do I square these two things?


00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.020
Like I can pip install it, but then it keeps complaining that you're, you're


00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:07.920
running the wrong version.


00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.700
Like, no, I'm not.


00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.700
The other one has our remote CVE in it, you know, a remote code execution in it.


00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.300
And I'm like, I really don't want that.


00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.180
I mean, not a server.


00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.220
So it's probably fine, but I really don't want that.


00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:22.140
No, I'm I don't care if it's slightly more unstable. I want the new one. Give it to me.


00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:28.460
Right. And that's that's a bit of a challenge. I think when you say like, I've got 50 dependencies


00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.460
and I've got to somehow square, I need to get a brand new one right away. What are your thoughts


00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:38.300
on that? Yeah, this this is a super tough problem. And I think it's one that open source will be


00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.380
coming to reckon with even more now. Right. Because we're kind of in a place now where


00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:48.940
there's a few really important libraries which are kind of moving something that is very extensively


00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:56.540
and widely used to be not maintained anymore. For example, OpenSSL. OpenSSL 1, or 1.1.1,


00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:02.300
which is extremely widely used, is no longer maintained. There's going to be no more security


00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:07.900
patches for that. And it's going to be tough, because my guess is that there's also just a lot


00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:14.380
of software that's not built for OpenSSL 3 being the OpenSSL of choice, right? Luckily, Python is


00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:20.140
not in that situation, but it's certainly a thing that other pieces of software might have to deal


00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:27.500
with. In terms of Python packaging, this is kind of why the guidance on don't specify an upper


00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:34.540
bound unless you know that that upper bound makes sense. And so, backwards incompatibility,


00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:41.100
Yeah, maybe you want to say, okay, if this is version 2.1.whatever, and it's semper,


00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.740
you can say, okay, anything less than three is probably fine.


00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.020
But even that, right, if that package goes unmaintained.


00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.020
>> Yeah, this went from two to three in its main version, right?


00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.420
It's major version, so.


00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.420
>> Right.


00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.420
Yeah, so this is a difficulty.


00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.420
>> There's a lot of packages.


00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.340
Yeah, there's a lot of packages that set hard upper bounds.


00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:04.140
And I just, I don't know why, because maybe it's going to break it, but I feel like it's


00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.140
speculative.


00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:09.940
we should probably not let a major version run. But you know that that leads into trouble, right?


00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:13.380
Like, even if you just want to use some other library that says greater than or equal to three,


00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.940
and this one says less than three, like, great. Now, what do I do?


00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.300
Yeah, I think that the toughest thing is that you can't go back and then like amend it.


00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:27.300
Yeah, that's the hardest part is because so I will speak very, very highly of all of these,


00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:34.820
anything that can make pip automatically get the right thing is just magical is so good. And so


00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:38.820
People like that and I totally get why people are doing these upper bound


00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:44.260
sorts of things but yeah it does have the issues that you that you talked about but yeah there's


00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:49.460
something to say about how great the uh those bound checks are I wish there was a way that


00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:55.380
you could add something like some sort of guidance to pip to say after the fact like okay I said this


00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.780
was open but now I'm gonna go ahead and tell you that like this definitely doesn't work with this


00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.100
version maybe that's something that can get recommended but yeah it's just so nice when


00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:04.940
when it does work out.


00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.600
Yeah.


00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:11.060
I, I can relate to Frank here who writes with 1.3 thousand or


00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.880
1,300 dependencies in our project because of this dependencies are at all times.


00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.380
Yeah.


00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.860
I have on Talk Python Training, the courses website, I think there's


00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.020
248 packages if you look at what's installed and then the dependencies.


00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.380
And then you try to throw in the data science-y stuff.


00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.180
And it's just like, there's a 50, 50 chance that I can actually install


00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.020
everything because like half the time, something has got a less than


00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.700
something's got a greater than, and I'm like, Oh my God.


00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.160
You add, as you upgrade, right?


00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.680
Like at any point in time, it's deterministic, but you know, over


00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.000
at, over the evolution of it.


00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.260
Right.


00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.820
Yeah, no, it's, it's tough.


00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.320
It's tough when you start getting to that number, like there's just


00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.080
so many intertangled things.


00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:47.680
There are.


00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.620
And like, the reason I bring this up now is it's, it's a hassle when like, I want


00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.720
to use this library and that library and somehow I've got to like juggle things.


00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.080
So they work, but it's concerning when you get a dependable alert that says


00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.420
there's a remote code execution, you're going to need to deal with it and your


00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.300
dependencies won't let you upgrade.


00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.180
You know what I mean?


00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.820
Like that's, that's why I bring this up.


00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.380
It's definitely concerning.


00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:08.720
Yeah.


00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.120
Another thing that you can do, and this is, I feel like they don't talk about


00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.100
this as much with Dependabot is that there are ways to mitigate vulnerabilities.


00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.060
That doesn't necessarily have to come from upgrading.


00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.540
Like I'm always going to say upgrading your dependency is the best way to go


00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.140
forward because then you know that there's no chance of at least that vulnerability


00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.860
in particular being exploited.


00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.660
But if it's something like remote code execution, but it's this one component.


00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.180
Right.


00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.260
As long as you're not using that component, then you're fine.


00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:40.660
Or if it's remote code execution, when you get some sort of input, whatever,


00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.780
right, that's, that's malformed or whatever.


00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.620
And you're like, okay, well that component's not exposed to the network.


00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.100
It's I only use it internally.


00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.220
So there is something to say.


00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.440
Not even a server.


00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.660
It doesn't open a port.


00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:52.860
Right.


00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.520
It's just a thing I run on my computer.


00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.180
It's like, it probably doesn't matter.


00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:56.900
Exactly.


00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.140
Yeah.


00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.180
And that's, that's kind of the one typing into it.


00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.340
And it's like, but if it's in your website, then all of a sudden


00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.220
it gets a little trickier.


00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:03.540
Right.


00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.540
Then it gets dicier.


00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.220
Yeah, definitely.


00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:05.380
Yeah.


00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.500
The stakes are higher when you attach the internet to anything, but when it's like


00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:14.660
a local script, it's just tail your log file and his request, request, hack, hack,


00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.300
request, attempted hack requests.


00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.620
It's just WP log in.


00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:17.860
Yes.


00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.220
Yeah.


00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.340
WP admin, all them things.


00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:20.740
Yeah.


00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:24.220
It's usually, luckily it's WP something or something most of the time.


00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.620
If you're safe against 90%, we're all good.


00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.720
As long as you don't return a 200 to any of those,


00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.660
like your traffic will remain low.


00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.860
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.060
(laughing)


00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.100
All right, so that's what you're doing,


00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.580
focusing on these kinds of things.


00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.780
That's really, really awesome.


00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.380
And thanks for giving us an even more detailed look


00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.060
than I expected into it.


00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.400
(laughing)


00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.020
Yeah, let's talk about your,


00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.140
let's talk about, you know, the timely thing.


00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.740
I mean, security's always timely, but the CPython,


00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:52.660
let me see if I get this right,


00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.300
3.12 release coming up here on Monday.


00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.340
- Dang, he's got it.


00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.180
- Amazing.


00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.000
I got it, man.


00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.840
I'm ready.


00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.140
I'm ready for this new world.


00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.980
So there is a pep and let's see who put this together.


00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.940
This is Barry Warsaw and Guido and it is pep 101.


00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:08.780
I love it.


00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.600
(laughs)


00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.440
Pep 101.


00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.280
- The one you need, right?


00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.700
- Yeah, what a perfect number.


00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.300
But it's the title is doing Python releases 101.


00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.500
That's kind of a circular, I love it.


00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.860
And it just talks about all the steps


00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.140
and it's kind of a manual of now you do this,


00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.840
Now you do that, but it's just a really long doc.


00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.580
I love that.


00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.720
Stop, stop, stop, stop.


00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.040
There's like, there's like a all caps all across.


00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.960
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.


00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.140
Did you do this right?


00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:37.620
Right.


00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.120
Yep.


00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.920
That you can tell, you can always tell when there were problems


00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.600
in the past in a checklist, right?


00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.820
Like if there ever was something that happened incorrectly, it's, it's very obvious.


00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.520
And so yeah, the stop, stop, stop.


00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:54.820
I feel that that I, I don't personally know why that's there, but I do


00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.880
laugh every time I see it.


00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.760
So, yeah.


00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.120
Uh, let's see.


00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.560
Please note how pep one Oh one replaces pep one or two time


00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.040
traveling was invented there.


00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:03.800
What is it?


00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.300
Yeah.


00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:04.920
At the very top.


00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.720
It's I wanted to comment on that too.


00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.520
It said replaces pep one Oh two.


00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.800
And I wonder if it was more like a, Oh, we should just use one


00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.600
Oh one sort of situation.


00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.440
Well, I think this is doing micro releases, right?


00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.800
So this one, maybe more like full, like the full deal.


00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.400
I don't know.


00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:21.640
Yeah.


00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.480
I think security releases are, they're slightly different.


00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.240
We don't actually build binary installers


00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.680
for security releases.


00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.320
We only build source builds,


00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.440
like source tarballs for micro releases.


00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.440
And so maybe that was the distinction in 102.


00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.280
- Sure.


00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.960
Okay, so this has existed since 2001,


00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.540
but you got to really dig into it.


00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.720
And you know, there's some interesting stuff there,


00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.000
but picture a thousand words, all these things,


00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.520
you put together a really nice graphic here.


00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.120
And somehow you got this in like HTML, I'm impressed.


00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.640
Yeah, that's embedded SVG.


00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.320
I, I always use draw.io for my, my diagrams.


00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.100
I take pride in my diagrams.


00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.040
So yeah, it looks good.


00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.080
All right.


00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.800
So there are 10 steps.


00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.800
Some of the steps have ABCs in them.


00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.760
So, and you know, just for people who pull up this picture and obviously being


00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.600
a podcast, it's hard to see the picture.


00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:21.360
If you're not watching the live stream, I will put a link to the article, which


00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.180
has the picture in there and by remember, right.


00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.740
I'll even put it as the chapter art.


00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.500
We'll see about that.


00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.200
Uh, but there's a legend in here.


00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.460
So you've got like different types of things.


00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:35.400
You've got human actors, which are golden release artifact, which is blue,


00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.120
a source of risk, which is where you're paying extra attention


00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.740
and the start and end state.


00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.560
And so, the colors mean stuff here and the legends at the bottom, but yeah,


00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.520
let's, you know, start with number one.


00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.440
Now what happens here?


00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:47.960
Yeah.


00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.760
So starting with number one, and I'm actually going to increase the size of my


00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.960
screen as well, because I'm going to pull it up separately myself.


00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.820
Going on here.


00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.320
Yeah.


00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.300
A lot going on here.


00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.880
You need some, you need some mandor control plus on it.


00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.620
Yep.


00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.120
Okay.


00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:03.620
All right.


00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:08.020
So in the very beginning, what happens is essentially the release manager


00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.480
decides it's time to make a release.


00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.240
It'll be right now.


00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.220
So we're, we're deciding, okay, we're going to make a release.


00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:21.220
And so something that happens even before this is we kind of talk amongst all of the other.


00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.940
It says release managers in there, like windows release manager, macOS release manager.


00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.940
They kind of flip between that language and experts.


00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.380
So like windows expert, macOS expert.


00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.140
Some people understand this weird windows things that can make a MSI installer.


00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.020
The people, what do you do on Mac?


00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.500
I don't even know how to build that right.


00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.180
That person.


00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:38.620
Yeah.


00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.100
Yeah.


00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:45.060
Talk to, talk to them, get, get their, get their buy-in that indeed they're going to be around when you decide to do


00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.980
this because this is kind of like a big coordinated thing. Everyone has to be around to do their


00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:55.300
part. And then if that is the case, then the release branch gets frozen. So in this case,


00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:01.380
that release branch would be 312. And so that's done by essentially putting a block on all


00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:07.740
future like pushes to the branch like in GitHub, use like branch protection. And that's basically


00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:12.340
to make it so that no one can merge pull requests anymore so that you have something that's


00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.020
stable that you can kind of work off of.


00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.660
And then after that, you'd move on to step two, which is the


00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.300
actual release manager will update their fork of the repo


00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.140
with whatever is on that branch.


00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.380
So like the three 12 branch will get updated and then you'll pull


00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.140
that branch locally now on step three.


00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.100
So now you're on the actual release managers machine.


00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:37.440
And so like, I kind of have like gray boxes drawn kind of throughout.


00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.940
So those are kind of like security boundaries a little bit.


00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.760
The top most one is the GitHub organization of Python.


00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.120
And then the middle, the tiny one that has the fork repo, that's the GitHub user for


00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.800
the release manager in particular.


00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:58.160
And then the furthest left, the gigantic one, is the release manager's actual computer.


00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.280
It's not documented anywhere.


00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.720
It's just how I was thinking about it.


00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.160
But yeah, so then there's this thing called release tool.


00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.600
And so release tool is basically just a Python script.


00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:15.000
on GitHub, if you go to github.com/python/release-tool, it's basically just a script that runs and


00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.960
then does all of the stuff that's needed to build the source distribution and documentation


00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:27.480
of a new Python release. And so you run that, and as a result, you kind of get like a huge


00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:31.120
amount of code that needs to be committed. And so there's a whole bunch of different


00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:36.360
little tools that kind of get run in addition to that. So things like Blurb, Sphinx gets


00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.840
as a part of that.


00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.440
Yeah, you need a whole lot of dependencies installed.


00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.760
So you like you need like late tech, you need a whole bunch of stuff installed for this


00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.760
to actually work.


00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:50.400
Do you make sure you've got like the right right compiler?


00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.600
Is there a lot of concern about that?


00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:58.320
Like is it clang or LLVM or GCC or, you know, I believe it's GCC.


00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.320
I believe it's GCC.


00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.800
You know, I didn't dig into that exact point.


00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800
I'm pretty sure it is.


00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.320
I feel like that's another part that you like that choice matters, right?


00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.120
Like you might get different outputs, you might discover bugs that weren't there.


00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:09.620
If you can.


00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.760
So you gotta kind of get that gray box all set up as well.


00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.260
Right?


00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.000
Yeah, definitely.


00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.560
And so the fact that it's on someone's machine, I would say reproducibility is,


00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.160
is quite tough in those sorts of situations, right?


00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:27.080
Like if, if, if someone were to build a release of Python and then a day goes by,


00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.720
like I guarantee you that the, if you tried to do it again with the exact same


00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.660
starting input, it would be potentially different.


00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:35.660
Right.


00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:39.420
And so that that's actually a problem from a security perspective for reproducibility,


00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:45.380
because it means that someone else can't verify that what you did is correct.


00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:46.380
Right.


00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.300
Like the hash might change or something like that.


00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.300
Right.


00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:54.260
Hashes might change or if there's like somehow the time is getting embedded into a binary


00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.260
somewhere.


00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.460
Like there's just a whole bunch of different ways that reproducibility could be different


00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.020
between two different runs.


00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:07.060
Yeah, and so that after the release tool happens, you basically get handed a couple of source


00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.660
tarballs that just have everything in them.


00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:13.620
And then you also get a bunch of Git changes to the repository.


00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:19.520
So these are things like the change log has been generated from all of the blurb notes.


00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.420
And so what you do is then you take all of those changes, and you create a big commit


00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:28.980
that says this is the release of CPython 3.12.0.


00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:32.600
And then you tag it and you push that to the fork.


00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.480
You don't push that to the main repository yet.


00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.740
And so the reason you don't push that to the main repository, and this is actually something


00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:44.440
that this phenomena is an interesting one, especially because a lot of security build


00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:52.280
tooling doesn't take this work workflow into account, which is you don't push the tag to


00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.240
the origin until the very end.


00:35:55.240 --> 00:36:01.120
A lot of security tooling like Salsa and all of these things will kind of, like, they won't


00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.840
assume because you can do it without tags.


00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:09.800
But, like, they'll have features that are, oh, we'll capture the git tag in the output


00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:14.680
of, like, this, like, document that says that your build is, came from this repository,


00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.620
this setup tooling, whatever, right?


00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:21.800
But a lot of projects actually wait on the tag until the very end because they want things


00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.120
to be repeatable without causing confusion.


00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.180
So if something went wrong throughout this whole release process, you wouldn't want there


00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:33.120
to be a tag on the main repo that is now confusing people, right?


00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.120
Because those tags cause notifications.


00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.120
>> I'm going to get the code.


00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.080
You're like, actually, no, the Mac build wouldn't build.


00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.480
We're going to fix that or whatever, right?


00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.480
>> Right, exactly.


00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:45.520
And so this whole thing is like very, it's a common thing.


00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.320
So pip actually has this exact same workflow where they do everything in the release until


00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.240
the very end, and then they push the tag to the repo because they know that if they push


00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:59.300
that tag, and it needs to change, it's going to cause confusion. So, yeah, that kind of


00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:05.540
is like step five in there. It pushes that tag. So that tag is highlighted red as a source


00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:14.900
of risk because that is a fork of CPython. And tags, tags are not in themselves verifiable.


00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:20.500
Because anyone can push a tag. If you're just looking at just the name of the tag, anyone


00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:26.120
can write a tag if you have write access to a Git repository or a GitHub repository.


00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:30.880
And so if you push a tag and say someone has access to your account, someone could move


00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.860
that tag to a different commit, completely different commit.


00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:38.520
And if it were pulled in that time, and no one decided to like check something else,


00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.160
so like the commit hash, for example, you would be circumvented, like it would be able


00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.800
to inject code into the process, right?


00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.760
That's as far as we know, that has not happened.


00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.760
Yeah, that is bad.


00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.440
bad to inject someone else's arbitrary code into Python directly.


00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:59.580
It's actually doubly bad because there's different degrees of bad in supply chain security.


00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:05.260
One degree of bad is if you're able to do bad stuff, but then people notice.


00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.400
Or people can see what happened.


00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.940
And so this is kind of like degrees of bad of you can inject code and then you can clean


00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.420
up after yourself afterwards.


00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.340
Put the tag back.


00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.340
Put the tag back.


00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:20.880
you have write access, right? And so that that sort of like put the tag back or being


00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:29.260
able to circumvent it in that way is is not good. Yeah, don't give people. These are not


00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:33.580
new ideas. So I feel less bad talking about these. Yeah, another thing in this article


00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:41.180
is actually like tying every step of the release process back to a known attack that has succeeded


00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:48.060
against another project. So like SolarWinds was about build, like release artifact poisoning,


00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:52.940
essentially, right? You're like taking advantage of the fact that these release artifacts are being


00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:58.540
distributed. And the you know, they're signed, everything looks good, but you've gotten code


00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:03.180
injected into the actual artifact itself, and it didn't get noticed. Right. And so like that sort


00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:09.100
of attack could happen against Python if if there's not mitigations against it, right. And so


00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.000
And so yeah, then the next step is six.


00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.900
And so at this point, the release manager has source tarballs from the result of just


00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.160
running the release tool.


00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.700
And so they're kind of just waiting.


00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.940
They're sitting around waiting for the other experts to do their thing now.


00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:28.260
And this is where Windows and Mac OS installers are actually built.


00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:33.900
And so these aren't built for security releases, but for 3.12.0, these will be built.


00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:38.900
They're two completely different sets of build processes.


00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.900
One of them happens in Azure Pipelines.


00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.660
So if you go to that release tool,


00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.900
there's actually a Windows folder


00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.200
that just has 100 YAML files in it


00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.900
for all of the different Azure Pipeline configurations.


00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.200
- Yeah, Azure Pipelines, a little bit like GitHub Actions.


00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.120
People who are familiar with that, but not Azure, right?


00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.040
Something roughly?


00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:58.880
- Yeah, yeah.


00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.000
And I think there was a time where Azure Pipelines


00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.040
and GitHub Actions were basically the same thing.


00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.040
Yeah, like in the very beginning.


00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:10.560
Um, yeah, so Azure pipelines, there's a whole bunch of stuff that happens there.


00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.760
Because there's Windows embeddable packages is something that gets uploaded to python.org.


00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.800
Windows installers also get uploaded to python.org.


00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.360
But that also there's like NuGet gets updated, the Windows Store gets updated there.


00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.200
So like, there's a lot happening there.


00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.560
And there's actually a lot of things that happen that require the actual release manager,


00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.360
or the Windows release manager to approve them.


00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.760
So they're gated.


00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.160
These are things like signing keys


00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.080
that are as a part of the process,


00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.400
you have to sign off to say,


00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.480
"Yep, we want to give this job access to the signing key."


00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.440
So that's great.


00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.200
- Do you know if WinGet is kind of like


00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.640
the newer package manager for Windows?


00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.440
Do you know if Python goes there as well these days?


00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.280
Let's see.


00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.320
- I haven't used Windows in a really long time,


00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.480
so I don't know.


00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.440
- I do, but I only use it for playing games


00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.600
and simple Windows tests, so I don't know it.


00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.360
All right, but yeah, so NuGet is like


00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.840
one of these kind of package managers for Windows,


00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.720
maybe Winget.


00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.040
People in the audience, if anyone knows,


00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:08.920
they can let us know.


00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.120
- Yeah, definitely.


00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.560
I've not even heard of Winget,


00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.000
so I feel really out of the loop right now.


00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.360
- It's only a couple of years old, I believe.


00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.640
- Gotcha, gotcha.


00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.200
- And following on with that,


00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.120
this probably won't help you


00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.280
if you don't do a lot of Windows.


00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.600
Louis asks, "Does Python maintain Chocolaty?"


00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.560
Which is similar to Winget,


00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.360
but more independent than Winget.


00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.360
They tried Winget and it was buggy and wasn't great.


00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.720
Chocolatey is maybe a little older.


00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.560
I don't know.


00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.660
Same story probably, right?


00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.760
- Yeah, I also don't know, unfortunately.


00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.320
Windows is not my strong suit.


00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.160
(laughing)


00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.060
- Chocolatey.


00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.360
- Yeah.


00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.200
- Yeah, it's all good.


00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.200
- Definitely a tastier name.


00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.520
That's how I choose all my tooling,


00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.020
is how tasty is the name.


00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:51.340
Yeah, and so then the, like the counterpart to that


00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.400
is the macOS binary installers.


00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.000
And so those are,


00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.440
There's basically just another set of scripts that get run on the Mac OS release manager,


00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:06.160
like their machine, and it builds just everything having to do with Mac OS.


00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.560
It does notarization.


00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:13.160
It does, you know, making I know not as much about Mac OS either, but I know that notarization


00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:18.640
happens and actually I've talked to a few folks about this one too, because this one,


00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:23.800
if you notice is just one square and it's just red and it's like, yeah, there's there's


00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.140
a lot more to dig into there.


00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.180
Um, yeah.


00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:26.640
But yeah,


00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.880
the MacOS notarization stuff is a serious pain as well.


00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.060
Like it's a little bit like submitting something to the iPhone app store where


00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.120
it, you know, it gets reviewed and yeah.


00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:36.640
Yeah.


00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.660
No, I think once you have it already notified, you can publish updates.


00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:43.580
Cause I was thinking as you were talking about that, like how do you design or


00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.900
deal with the latency, you know, of like I've submitted it and how long does


00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.100
someone picks it up and reviews it?


00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:49.600
I don't know.


00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:53.300
But I guess once it's kind of approved for notarization, then it, it just


00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.400
It goes through pretty quickly.


00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.120
You just set a really long time out on your CI job.


00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.720
Like exactly time out seven weeks.


00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.080
Yeah.


00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.360
Give it a week at least.


00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.480
Yeah, no.


00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:09.600
And so then after all of those things kind of happen, there's this stage in,


00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.480
you know, there's a stop, stop, stop line in the, pep one-on-one that just


00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:17.320
basically says for the release manager to wait for everyone to be done with their


00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:17.680
thing.


00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.720
And then once everyone's done with their thing and has uploaded everything to


00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.360
to python.org, there's basically this phase


00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.400
of testing everything.


00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.400
So you download everything, you make sure everything works


00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.720
on all the operating systems the way that's expected to.


00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.120
You don't wanna blow the horn and then realize


00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.360
the very last mile that there's something wrong.


00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.800
And so lots of testing happens,


00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.400
and then after the testing happens, at that point,


00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.640
then everything that will get uploaded to python.org,


00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.200
or that has been uploaded to python.org,


00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.520
gets signed by the release manager in particular


00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.620
with SIGSTORE and GPG.


00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.260
And then from there, all of those signatures get published.


00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.060
And that is the end of python.org.


00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.860
All of the artifacts are published.


00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.260
And only then does the release manager, this is step 10,


00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:04.320
do a git push to the actual upstream CPython repo.


00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.260
And at that point, then the branch can be unblocked,


00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.980
all of these things, the release is done,


00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.700
everyone's happy, we can celebrate.


00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:15.060
Yeah, that's kind of the very high level view


00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.460
of what happens.


00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.300
- Amazing.


00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.660
A couple of thoughts here.


00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:25.160
First of all, the Windows Square is like tangibly different than the Mac OS Square.


00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:33.680
The Windows Square says, send off some source code to Azure pipelines, a external repeatable CI build system.


00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.740
Whereas the Mac line is like, build it.


00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:36.540
You know what I mean?


00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.940
That's actually pretty interesting.


00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:42.380
And I don't know that there's an Azure pipeline for Mac OS, right?


00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.980
Like that's just the sort of the story of Mac and servers and.


00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.020
But just highlighting those differences, right?


00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.340
Like it's, it's a different thing to say I build on my machine with whatever I


00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:56.240
got versus I pushed to something like Azure pipeline CI CD and get some results.


00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:56.940
Yeah.


00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:02.100
Both the source tarball builds and the Mac OS builds are all local.


00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:02.560
Right.


00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.900
And they're not done with a repeatable like CI provider.


00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.860
Um, I was actually able to get like the actual source tarballs


00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.460
to work on GitHub actions.


00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:17.340
And, and so that, that's something that I've worked on and have provided


00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.820
that to release managers and we're talking about it right now.


00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:25.260
And macOS is actually, to my knowledge, is actually going to be revamped a little bit


00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.180
because that tooling has been around for so long.


00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.700
I think that there's going to be some work done on it.


00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:32.700
And so I haven't dug into it as deeply.


00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:37.780
I've kind of more just provided a bunch of context to the release managers about things that I want to see.


00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:41.260
Like if I were to do this myself, this is the other things I'm interested in.


00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:41.660
Right.


00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:46.220
Provided that you actually had access to a macOS system,


00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:49.420
I'm sure you could do it all from the CLI because for example, for the


00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:53.020
talk, Python and courses apps, we use Flutter and you just say, what a run.


00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:58.860
And it compiles that, that iOS or Mac OS version somehow through the command


00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:03.420
line and then like outcomes a, a thing that is already deployed onto, you


00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.500
know, a simulator or something.


00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:04.780
Right.


00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.660
So it could happen.


00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:11.300
I mean, there is, there is some hosting, but it's kind of like, here's


00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.500
your Mac mini in the cloud.


00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:13.260
Go, go.


00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.060
I mean, there is a, what is it?


00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.780
GitHub action supports Mac OS.


00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:17.460
So does it?


00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:17.820
Okay.


00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.380
So yeah, so possibly, possibly.


00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:19.620
Yeah.


00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.700
Maybe, maybe it could happen.


00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.980
I'm not saying it has to, I'm just, it was a kind of a striking difference that


00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.820
one is like a CI/CD process and one is local and manual.


00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.260
Yeah.


00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:33.580
Actually windows is the most repeatable, most like actually isolated from, from


00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.220
any, from the, just the machine itself, right.


00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.580
The release manager themselves.


00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:38.300
So yeah.


00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:38.740
Yeah.


00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:39.460
That's pretty interesting.


00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:43.180
And then we have binaries and they get published and everybody is happy.


00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:47.180
We all go and install it and it's been in testing for quite a while, right?


00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:48.780
Like we've had a bunch of betas.


00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:49.420
We had alphas.


00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:54.280
We have had three release candidates and on Monday we'll have a dot zero.


00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.080
It's exciting.


00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.080
It's really exciting.


00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:56.940
It is exciting.


00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:02.840
The other question I would ask you is like, what is the time from like step one to step 10?


00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.680
How much clock time has passed wall time?


00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:10.840
I would say that it is on, it's on the scale of hours.


00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.320
It's not like a day.


00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.100
which is kind of incredible, right?


00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.940
The fact that you get three volunteers together


00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.180
to do a bunch, all of this stuff,


00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.940
and it only takes a couple hours.


00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.140
It obviously depends on how many problems you run into


00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.300
on the way, because if you get to the very end


00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:30.300
and then there's a problem that you find in testing,


00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.900
you have to kind of start over.


00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.620
But yeah, if everything goes to plan,


00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:38.300
which has happened, I've coordinated security,


00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.900
like there was a couple of security fixes


00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:43.260
that were in 3.11.5 that I coordinated.


00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.220
And yeah, I got to kind of witness the,


00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:49.260
okay, we've decided we're making a security release to the actual,


00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.140
it's out there, we can now talk about the vulnerabilities.


00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.420
Yeah, it's on the scale of ours.


00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:54.540
Is that the int parsing thing?


00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.780
It was the, what was it?


00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:00.380
There was an int part or was it int parsing?


00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.020
No, it wasn't.


00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:02.860
Really long ints, I don't know.


00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:03.740
No, that's a different one.


00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:09.660
No, it was, there was a TLS and this one sounds really scary.


00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:19.580
It's not as scary. It's a TLS bypass on the server side. So like if the client is supposed


00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:25.580
to be authenticated, for example, if you're using MTLS, you can if you like send a handshake and


00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:32.140
then immediately close your socket, you can get lucky during like a brief period of time where


00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:37.740
the socket on the other side, like the server socket will say like, oh, it's closed. So it's


00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:43.580
it's fine, right? And the data that whatever you sent over the wire won't will still be


00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:49.300
readable. But then the handshake hasn't actually like completed. And so that sounds like scary,


00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:55.860
right? But it's it's actually not as bad because so many protocols, well, for one, so many


00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:01.220
protocols don't even use client authentication at all. So that's one huge point. The other


00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:08.340
side of it is that all protocols that people do end up using mutual TLS with are protocols


00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:14.860
that you have to send something back to... So like HTTP, for example. You have to send


00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:21.040
something back, and at that point, the socket is closed. And so it can't send the data back.


00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.980
So there's no data exfiltration. It's a pretty narrow scope of what's actually vulnerable.


00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:31.540
Yes, the fix for that vulnerability is in 3.11.5.


00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.180
And there's another one too, but it's a little bit more minor.


00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.340
Well, we'll start fresh with 3.12.


00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:39.220
And hopefully you will not have to witness one of these releases.


00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:45.540
Honestly, given how large CPython is and how wide ranging its standard library attempts to be,


00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.260
it does not have many vulnerabilities.


00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:50.660
I mean, you go look at like a web browser upgrade.


00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:55.460
It's like, here's the 27 remote code execution vulnerability.


00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:56.340
Maybe not quite that many.


00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.540
But here's the 27 security fixes this month, you know?


00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:02.980
- Yeah, we've maybe, maybe it's a little more front of mind right now,


00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.860
now that like Chrome is on their fifth zero day of the week.


00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.820
But yeah, it's, it's pretty tough week for Chrome right now.


00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.140
- Yeah.


00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.900
- And Firefox and the rest of us.


00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.740
- Yeah. Yeah, for sure.


00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.740
Let's see another comment from Frank says,


00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.260
"SIGstore and GPG seem a bit at the end of the process,


00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.220
considering these are built locally in some cases.


00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:26.180
How does one guarantee that the sign sources are still right?"


00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:32.580
Yeah, so this is kind of getting to the, like, I agree with you, how does one track that


00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.860
they're still right?


00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.300
So they get uploaded to Python.org.


00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:41.420
And at that point, they're kind of like in a holding pattern for testing.


00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:45.480
And so those binaries are there, they're on Python.org, they've got, you know, the hashes


00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.740
have already been taken.


00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.260
Then the testing happens.


00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:53.500
So like, anything that happens between that and the Sixer styling, like, yeah, at that


00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:54.500
point, it's kind of protected.


00:50:54.500 --> 00:51:00.100
But yeah, there is this really big dwell time where you just have artifacts sitting on someone's


00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:04.660
machine, and they're going to get signed and sent out the door. And that's kind of like


00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:08.580
the due diligence of release managers, they need to make sure that those are the right


00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:12.260
artifacts that they've been tested properly, that the ones that you tested locally are


00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:17.060
the ones that are going to get ended up being signed. Yeah. And so this is something this


00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:23.020
is like a, a piece of the whole puzzle that gets mitigated by having those builds happen


00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:27.500
on external services as opposed to on someone's local machine. Because at that point, you're


00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.500
just giving --


00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:33.140
>> Yeah, you're just giving this, like, set of scripts, like, very, very narrow set of


00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:38.660
input. Like, I want this exact git commit and this version number to get built. And


00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:43.380
then out pops, like, a tarball that's already been signed and verified and everything. And


00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.860
then from there, you just put that on Python.org, right?


00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:46.860
>> Awesome.


00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:51.460
>> Like, that is a lot less -- there's a lot less of that risk where it's just on someone's


00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:56.100
machine and how, how do, how does one know that that is the exact thing that they built?


00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.100
It's not provable.


00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.100
Yeah.


00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.580
What about virtual machines for these gray boxes?


00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:03.180
I mean, obviously the Azure one, that's, that's its own thing, but have you considered


00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:11.300
like a, a Docker or an official just RLs VM go like here, take this, run that, you know


00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.300
what I mean?


00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:13.300
Um, yeah.


00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:17.780
To, to make it a little less dependent on the person whose role it is that year.


00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:22.020
It definitely would help with the reproducibility side of things, because as we know, Docker


00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:25.960
is just the whole machine shipped in a box, right?


00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:29.580
So yeah, in theory, if you build the same thing again in that exact same image, you


00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:31.760
would end up getting a pretty similar result.


00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.580
So it helps on that front, which is good.


00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:39.460
I think the tough thing is that you still don't have control of the inputs, and the


00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.940
output you also still don't have.


00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.660
It comes out of the Docker container, you get a tarball.


00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.420
There's still that time in between when the tarball is out of the container and when it's


00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:55.580
actually on python.org, where it's on someone's machine that is not in a container.


00:52:55.580 --> 00:53:00.380
And containers also aren't the best in terms of like, you did mention virtual machines


00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:08.180
as well, but even that, like on a machine that is a high value target, you know, maybe


00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.180
it's worth it.


00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.180
Who knows?


00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.180
Yeah.


00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.180
Yeah.


00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.180
Who knows?


00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.180
All right.


00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.860
It's happening Monday.


00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.620
So very exciting.


00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.020
And I'm looking forward to all the new work.


00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:25.220
I mean, are there new features in 3.12 that are you particularly excited about?


00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:30.420
You know, since being in this role, I actually haven't been paying attention to Python releases


00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.700
as much, Python features as much.


00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.620
I'm mostly excited about it getting faster.


00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.380
I mean, the generic, it's just straight up faster.


00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:41.300
Like there's no one on the planet that's not happy about that.


00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.060
What are the major features this release?


00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:46.380
So there's like a some more broad F string thing.


00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:49.660
So you should be able to have a subset of the language in the F string.


00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.380
And now you can kind of like program in the F string, I believe.


00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.020
Um, type statement, better generic types.


00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:56.260
Yeah.


00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:00.860
There's like a, a simpler way to express generics in the type system.


00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:05.580
And then I'm with you, you know, honestly, like F strings being nicer.


00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:06.380
That's awesome.


00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:07.100
Thanks for that.


00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:09.980
But faster, faster, faster is good.


00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.500
Uh, this per interpreter, Gil's kind of part of that.


00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.080
faster CPython thing, right?


00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.640
Like it's hard to leverage, but if you could just say in your threads, new


00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.760
interpreter for this bit, right?


00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.540
All of a sudden you escape the gill for computational stuff.


00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:24.580
That'd be pretty interesting.


00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.840
Um, but you know, also this, this is another interesting thing.


00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.420
If you pull up this list, like the size of the scroll bar, I don't know.


00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.580
We were talking about scary scroll bars earlier.


00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.440
Like this is next level.


00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.140
Let me see.


00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.260
I'm going to, I'll throw this into Omnivore.


00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.540
Are you a fan of Omnivore?


00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.140
This app?


00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:40.940
Omnivore.


00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:41.820
Never heard of it.


00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:42.520
What is it?


00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.040
Omnivore.app.


00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.180
Kind of a Instapaper pocket replacement.


00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:47.120
Oh, I'm already logged into it.


00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:47.520
Look at that.


00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.700
Oh, super, super cool.


00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.260
So I go here and you say, add a link.


00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.100
Actually, it just, I think it just went in there.


00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:54.540
Let's see.


00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.140
40 minutes just to read that.


00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:56.660
What's new.


00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.540
That's what I was trying to pull.


00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.820
It just, yeah.


00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:02.020
It calculates that for you.


00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.820
It's like, it's going to take a while.


00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:07.820
So just the, a sense of like, what is new in Python 3.12.


00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.780
That's a ton, right?


00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:09.180
Yeah.


00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:11.540
A ton of stuff, like tons of fixes.


00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.840
Tons of fixes and improvements.


00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.840
Mike Feeler out in the audience says Python dash M, SQLite 3 is nifty.


00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.800
Mike, you're going to have to tell me more about this.


00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.860
Does that, does that open up a database now?


00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.820
That would be lovely.


00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:24.400
Yeah.


00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.260
That would be cool.


00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.800
Kind of like the HTTP server.


00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:27.560
Yes.


00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.140
Yeah.


00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.340
Or the JSON tool.


00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.180
The JSON tool is the one I use the most.


00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:32.020
What's that one do?


00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:35.160
Uh, so you can like pipe JSON into it and it'll just make it pretty.


00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:40.180
It's pretty, it's questionable how useful it is, but it sure does make pretty JSON.


00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:40.700
Yeah.


00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.740
which I really appreciate.


00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:45.300
Like two space indented JSON.


00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.660
That's perfect.


00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:47.860
- Indeed. All right.


00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:49.540
One more comment from the audience


00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:50.540
and then we'll maybe wrap it up.


00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:53.060
Karen, hey Karen, says,


00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:56.500
let me, she's clarifying above,


00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.580
like VM Docker for less changes


00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.620
and better reproducibility.


00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:06.340
"VM Docker for less heterogeneity reproducibility


00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.660
than the current situation,


00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.060
which is affected by a given user's environment."


00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:10.300
Yeah.


00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:14.780
Like what web browser did you install today or something completely unrelated


00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:18.080
or, you know, or like you upgrade, if it's your personal machine and you're


00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:22.960
using tools, like if you upgrade those tools, it could pull some other system


00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.680
dependency, right.


00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.640
That ends up being relevant to the build of CPython.


00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.300
And yeah, it's just, there's just so much that could be different over


00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.620
the course of even a few days.


00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:32.140
Yeah.


00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:32.640
Yeah.


00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:37.000
Which is why it's interesting that the windows one goes to Azure pipelines.


00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.300
Cause it kind of pulls, puts that to the side.


00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:39.500
Right.


00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:39.940
Yeah.


00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:40.940
All right, Seth.


00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.940
Well, this has been super, super interesting.


00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.940
And thanks for giving us a look into this world.


00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:48.940
So, yeah, very, very excellent.


00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:50.940
And I guess, you know, final two questions.


00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.940
Can you write some Python code?


00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:54.940
What editor are you using these days?


00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.940
Yeah, I'm using PyCharm.


00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:57.940
I love PyCharm.


00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:01.940
Specifically, you know, I have the--what is it?


00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.940
I had the Professional Edition for a good long while,


00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:05.940
and then I let that subscription lapse,


00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:07.940
and I need to just renew it.


00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:11.940
So I'm using the community edition right now, but yeah, I love PyCharm so much.


00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:13.260
So really good editor.


00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.260
Awesome.


00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.260
I'm there with you.


00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:18.980
And then notable PyPI package, something that is interesting to you.


00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:20.860
I already talked about these.


00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:22.760
So pip audit, just use pip audit.


00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:27.620
There's so much work happening somewhere with pip audit that it just makes sense for you


00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:30.420
to use it because there's just a ton of work happening.


00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:34.340
And if you just add it to your workflow, you'll just know that things are vulnerable or like


00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.660
what's vulnerable and like what versions you should update to.


00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:40.120
>> Yeah, I already have some tooling that,


00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.700
like some aliases that do three or four steps to


00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:45.460
actually update my dependencies and install them.


00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:49.180
Like I might as well just throw this as like another and and pip audit.


00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.260
>> Yeah, and you can actually,


00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:55.900
so I think there's a way you can tell pip audit to install packages,


00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.500
but then it will say something if


00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.260
there is a vulnerability in whatever you're installing.


00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:04.020
So you can even replace pip install with that, I believe.


00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.220
>> Use pip audit.


00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:06.560
I think that that is a feature.


00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.200
All right.


00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:07.820
I think so.


00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:09.000
It has a features thing.


00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:09.540
Let me look at it.


00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:10.540
Oh, let's see it.


00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:11.700
Oh, it's not going to work.


00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:12.460
Cause it's not the read me.


00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.340
It's true.


00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:17.140
I got to go to the homepage, which will take me here.


00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:17.980
So I gotta go to the source.


00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:21.220
Uh, no, where's the GitHub.


00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:22.380
I only go to the stars.


00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:22.860
All right.


00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.160
You know what?


00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.660
Maybe I don't want to click this thing.


00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:25.260
Features.


00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:25.900
There we go.


00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.500
Multi-villain admitting.


00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:31.940
We haven't talked about S bombs, but seamlessly reuse here.


00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:37.020
listening. Yeah. If it reuses the pip caches, maybe, maybe, maybe. All right.


00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:37.820
What is it?


00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.740
I'll play with it. We'll see. People can check it out.


00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.980
Citation needed. Citation needed.


00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:46.940
Exactly. Citation needed. That's right. All right. Well, yeah. People check out pip audit.


00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:52.220
That looks excellent. And yeah. Final call to action. People are interested in this. I mean,


00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:56.300
give a thought to it on Monday, theoretically, at least in the past,


00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:59.420
if you listen too far in the future, but you know, the next release.


00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:04.940
Yeah, no, I think the biggest so in terms of like, what can you personally do? Because like,


00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:08.860
there's just I just talked about so much stuff that is just kind of happening in the background.


00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:14.780
But there's also stuff that like individual people can do. And the most impactful URL that you can


00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:19.900
visit for security, if you're an open source consumer or like a maintainer, like it doesn't


00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:26.860
matter, this is just gonna be impactful if you work in software is best dot open ssf.org. So


00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:31.980
So that is basically just like a web page and it just has a few URLs and you click into


00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:36.780
any of those URLs and it just gives you like a checklist of your things to think about


00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:40.340
here's and then if you click into those checklist items, it gives you it's kind of like this


00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:46.940
recursive nice, like guiding force of like, here's the things you could be doing, right?


00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:50.820
And if you want to dig in more size guide for developing more secure software, in other


00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:54.420
words, NPM best practices, and so on.


00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:55.420
Yeah, excellent.


00:59:55.420 --> 01:00:02.140
I'm hoping to put a Python best practices guide there by the end of the year that I'm here.


01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.900
So don't you worry. Look forward to that.


01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:08.460
Excellent. I'll be right there. We'll get it above on the list.


01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:12.300
Yeah, it'll somehow not sort alphabetically and it'll be okay.


01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:15.900
Tip the scales a little bit.


01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:19.180
Exactly. Cool. Well, thank you for being here, Seth.


01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:22.460
And thank you for all this hard work that you're doing. It's good to know that you're out there
