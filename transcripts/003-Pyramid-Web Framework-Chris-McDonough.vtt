00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:09.200
Talk Python To Me. Episode number three. With guest, Chris McDonough. Recorded Monday, April 6th, 2015.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:39.100
Hello and welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.320
On Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:52.820
This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Twitter where I'm @mkennedy, and keep up with the show and listen to past episodes at talkpythontome.com.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.000
This episode, we'll be talking to Chris McDonough about the Pyramid Web Framework.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.560
Before we get to Chris, I have a few things to share with you.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.140
First, thanks again to Python Gear for sponsoring the last episode.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.480
They gave away a t-shirt to one lucky friend of the show.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.060
I randomly chose a listener from the group, and Alejandro Villamarin from Spain was our lucky winner.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.760
So congrats to Alejandro.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.660
We now have a Facebook page, so be sure to like us on Facebook if that's your thing.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.660
We're at facebook.com slash talkpython.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.160
And we are also on SoundCloud.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.340
You can listen to us on SoundCloud at soundcloud.com slash talkpython.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:44.740
Listener Nathan Chowning, who's at nbchowning on Twitter, pointed out a cool Kickstarter called Python 101 by Mike Driscoll to turn his book, Python 101, into a video series.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.440
It's already over $2,000 pledged towards his $5,000 goal, so check that out if you're interested in supporting Mike.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.480
You can find the link in the show notes on talkpythontome.com.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.660
Finally, I've started a Patreon campaign for this show.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.980
Patreon allows listeners to directly support us with very small contributions, for example, a dollar for a show.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.980
More details on this later, but you can find the campaign at patreon.com slash mkennedy.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:22.800
Patreon is actually doing some very cool work with Python, and since I started the campaign, they reached out to me, and we had a small discussion about what they're doing with Python.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:32.480
I decided it would make an excellent show, so we're going to talk to Patreon about how they're moving from PHP to Python 3, and that's how that's making all of their developers happy.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.600
So look for that in an upcoming episode.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.020
Now, let's get on to the interview with Chris.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.880
Let me introduce Chris.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.700
Chris McDonough is the primary author of the Pyramid Web Framework and the supervisor, Process Manager.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.360
He has been a member of the Python community since 1999, and he is a principal of Agenda-less Consulting.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.220
Chris, welcome to the show.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.000
Thanks, Michael.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.940
How are you today?

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.920
I'm doing great.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.640
Thanks so much for being on my podcast.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.260
Yes, thank you for doing it.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.980
It's great to have another podcast, Python podcast.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.760
Excellent.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.220
And, you know, the reason I reached out to you is I'm a huge fan of the Pyramid Web Framework.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.460
Oh, go on.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.560
No, I am.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.300
I mean, our website is even written in Pyramid.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.060
I do love it.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.700
So I wanted to talk to you and just sort of learn more about the history and what people are doing with it.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.040
Great.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.000
Yeah, I'd be happy to answer.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.660
Cool.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.740
So what is Pyramid?

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.840
Well, Pyramid is a Python Web Framework.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.360
And that term means many things to many different people.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.480
But it is a sort of web framework that's kind of light, I guess you would call it.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.680
I hesitate to call it a micro framework, although it kind of sort of fits in the same little box.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:56.080
That's one of the things that drew me to Pyramid was I think Django may be the most popular one out there just from taking the pulse of talking to people.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:09.400
But I feel like Django is like you build with these great big giant blocks, whereas with web frameworks like Pyramid, I'm building more with like little Lego pieces and not huge shipping containers.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.440
So I really like the granularity and the control I have when I'm working with Pyramid.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.380
Yeah, I do too.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:24.800
And, you know, I actually came into Python through Zope, you know, in like 1998 or 99, something like that.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.860
Zope is the, you know, kind of the antithesis of Pyramid, although they, you know, I stole lots of ideas from Zope.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:40.840
But Zope and Django and, you know, there's another framework called Web2Py are kind of, I guess what you'd call full stack web frameworks.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:50.300
You know, they actually have built into them, you know, database bindings and ways to administer the site.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.100
And, you know, they have UI to them and all kinds of stuff.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:06.640
Pyramid is a little bit more like something like Sinatra or Flask or other micro frameworks are escaping me, but, you know, something that's a little bit smaller.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.480
Maybe Bottle.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.500
Bottle, yeah, exactly.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.860
Yeah, Bottle is an example.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.880
And when I think of Pyramid, I think of sort of its peer or rival, frenemy maybe, I don't know, is Flask, right?

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.700
These are kind of the lighter weight versions.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:32.380
You came from this background of these sort of bigger, larger, what you call full stack frameworks where it's like they predefine.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.960
Here is your data access layer.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.580
Here is your template layer.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.080
Here is how you wire this all together.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.320
What inspired you to go in the opposite direction?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.260
Well, like I said, you know, I came to Python through Zope.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.820
And Zope, even the word Zope, you know, can mean different things to different people.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:06:03.280
But, you know, when I came to it in 99, it meant the thing that's currently now referred to as the Zope2 web framework.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.840
And it was actually really great at the time.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.520
I used it to build, you know, I didn't, I ended up working for the people who made Zope for a number of years.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.960
But I did not work there then.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:27.400
I used it to build a site for an electrical, an electric company in Philadelphia that was something that we would now call today a content management system.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.060
But I don't think that term existed then.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.920
Well, the web world is a very, very different place than it was in 1998.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.420
I mean.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.980
Oh, yes.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.060
So what people expect out of web frameworks may have changed as well.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.940
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:50.660
And, yeah, so that sort of skips over to the heart of it, which is that these days it's becoming much more interesting to write your UI in JavaScript.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:07:00.200
In HTML, instead of, you know, server-side templates and sort of, you know, web 1.0, reload the page things, you have these frameworks.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.340
Sure, AngularJS or Ember or any of these things, right?

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.260
Yeah.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:12.320
And those things really don't need, you know, there's not much retail UI.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:28.780
And when I say retail UI, I mean, you know, the UI that your customers see when you make an application or something that these days is, you know, more pleasant to write, you know, on a totally server-side application than it could be in just JavaScript.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:38.220
So the frameworks have become smaller as a result, and a lot of the stuff that the old frameworks did have moved into these JavaScript libraries.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.200
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:54.200
And I think the lighter-weight web frameworks pair well with, hey, I mostly need you to deliver HTML and CSS and JavaScript and then provide a cool sort of service layer back end to keep the JavaScript active.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.760
Yeah, I totally agree.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.120
I mean, that's the way people are thinking about how that works.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:11.300
That said, you know, it's often pretty convenient to write just flat-out, you know, templated web pages that, you know, have links that go to other templated web pages.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.180
And I don't think that'll ever die.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.120
It's not.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.820
It's definitely not going to die, and not in the near-term anyway.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:23.040
And I think if for no other reason than purely for SEO purposes, right?

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:29.920
So if I've got a cool AngularJS page and it's got all my handlebar stuff in there, it's more or less empty of content.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:38.460
And if Google or Bing come along and try to index it, it's just going to say, hey, angle bracket, angle bracket content, as opposed to the real content of the page.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:50.840
And so as long as you're writing public-facing sites, you want to show up in search engines, you know, unless the search engines start executing the AngularJS bits, which they may well be trying, but I don't know that they do today.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:59.240
You know, there's still going to be some place for these sort of back-end, server-oriented, templated pages, at least the public-facing ones.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:09.680
Maybe your admins area becomes an AngularJS sort of spa type of application, but the front-end for your public-facing stuff probably will be HTML for a while to come.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.240
Yeah, I think that's right.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:18.180
And I'm sure Google's going to have to write a crawler that executes JavaScript pretty soon, you know?

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.240
I mean…

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.760
Yeah, it's going to be unavoidable.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.680
Yeah.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:30.080
Michael here.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.540
Thank you so much for listening to and spreading the word about Talk Python TV.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.160
The response to the podcast continues to be wonderful and humbling.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.020
I have a quick comment about supporting and sponsoring the show.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:49.000
I'm still looking to line up stable corporate sponsorships, but I wanted to tell you about a community-based campaign I'm launching to allow listeners to directly support the show.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.440
We are running a Patreon campaign.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:10:00.040
You might not have heard about Patreon, but it's kind of like Kickstarter for things like podcasts, which release frequent small deliverables rather than one-off large engineering projects.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.900
Visit patreon.com slash mkennedy.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:12.080
That's p-a-t-r-e-o-n dot com slash mkennedy and watch the video to see how you can donate as little as $1 per episode to support Talk Python To Me.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.920
This is your chance to ensure that the Python community continues to have a strong public voice.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.120
Consider supporting us today at patreon.com slash mkennedy.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.140
And thanks for listening.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:38.520
And really, you know, one of the things, one of my minor, you know, kind of pet peeves are just like, the Pyramid Docs have this in there.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.960
And, you know, I wrote something about it.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.780
There's a page in the Pyramid Docs called Design Defense.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:59.920
And one of the design defenses is that I don't call it an MVC framework because, to me, you know, MVC means a UI that has events that, you know, like it's a small talk thing.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.800
That's where that's from, that term.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.780
And the web is nothing like that, you know.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:11.480
Until we get these JavaScript frameworks, which actually do work like that, and those can be called MVC, you know.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:17.220
But I think Rails came along in, you know, 2005 or 2007 or whenever it was.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:17.960
Yeah, that sounds about right.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:28.840
And I think it introduced the idea that, okay, your views are your templates and your controllers are, you know, our Ruby code.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.380
Your model is your database.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.820
And I don't think that was ever true.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.120
You know, it sort of just got jammed on there.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.100
But now it actually is true, you know, with these JavaScript frameworks.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:47.060
Like you were saying, you know, you have these really thin applications that just serve out XML or they serve out JSON, you know, whatever.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.940
And your JavaScript stitches it all together and builds your UI.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.120
And the JavaScript is, you know, it's Turing complete.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.360
So, you know, you can do whatever you want.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.360
You can, you know, the UI can change as a result of a server through WebSockets or SSC or, you know, whatever.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.440
And it's really interesting.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.580
And that's another reason I think people are interested in it.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.200
Yeah, that's really, really cool.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.680
I think JavaScript is definitely eating a large portion of the world.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.780
So there's plenty of interesting stuff that's happening there.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.140
Well, we're all JavaScript programmers.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.060
That's right.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.140
We don't want to be.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:33.840
So, first of all, let's maybe, maybe you could walk the listeners through what the process of setting up all through the PyPI down to a running web page.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.480
Walk us through what are the steps to getting started with PyPyramid.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.000
Sure.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:52.700
So for better or worse, you know, we started out in Pyramid and we embraced Python packaging, including something that was, had been around for a long time when we embraced it.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.820
But people tend to bounce off of it, set up tools.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:06.080
And so Pyramid itself is a distribution in PyPI terms, which means, you know, a file that can be downloaded.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.980
This is a targz file that gets installed when you run either easy install or pip.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:19.580
And it has a bunch of dependencies mentioned in it that also come down as a result of you downloading it.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.160
And then those have dependencies, et cetera.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:31.400
And I think at this point, at our sort of beefiest, we had maybe 13, you know, 13 distributions that came down when you installed Pyramid.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.980
I think it's down to seven or something now.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:40.340
The reason we had so many was because we used to ship both two templating languages with the framework.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:45.760
And we stopped that because, you know, there was no purpose in it.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.180
We could do the same thing just by letting people choose.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:50.660
Sure.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.620
So you used to do Chameleon and Mako.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.740
Is that correct, by default?

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.160
That's right.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.500
And now you're just down to Chameleon?

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.280
Now we don't have any.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:07.840
Now no templating languages gets installed with the – no templating bindings get installed and no templating package gets installed when you install Pyramid.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.600
Right.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.580
So you have to make the choice and install it yourself.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.080
Right.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:17.500
So when I create a site, maybe through one of the scaffolding things, in there it would have Chameleon as a dependency.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:23.820
But the core, if I say pip install Pyramid, I don't get a templating framework necessarily.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.040
That's right.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.500
That's right.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.200
And you brought up a good word, which is the scaffolding.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:36.680
So that's a term that I stole from Pylons, and maybe Pylons was another web framework.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:42.440
Oh, by the way, I should mention it confuses people that this web framework is called Pyramid.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.420
It is part of a project, of a larger project called the Pylons Project.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:15:00.700
The Pylons Project has in it the Pyramid web framework, the sort of legacy old Pylons web framework, and then a bunch of other – a mess of other software that has sort of the same authors, me included.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:10.140
The way that people should probably think about that is there's the Apache Software Foundation, and they have God knows how many pieces of software at this point.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.420
But there's also the Apache Web – or sorry, Web Server.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.880
And so they – so anyway, I wanted to explain that.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.240
Yeah, that confused me when I first got started looking at Pyramid.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:30.300
I'm like, okay, there's Pylons, which kind of seemed like to be this older framework, and then there's Pyramid, and they were kind of merged, but they're somewhat distinct.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.940
And so, yeah, thanks for the clarification there.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:45.640
Yeah, I think it confuses everybody, and really it was just kind of a negotiated thing because, you know, we started out and we just kind of mashed – we thought we were going to mash three things together at first.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:58.040
We thought we were going to mash Pylons and the framework that Pyramid was renamed from, which had the awesome name of Repose.BFG.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.780
It was a terrible name.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.380
And we also thought we were going to get TurboGears, you know, in our thing.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:16.760
We actually met in, like, me, Ben Bangert, who's the guy who rode Pylons, and Mark Graham, who at the time was the guy who was maintaining TurboGears, or one of the guys who maintained TurboGears.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.900
And we, you know, came up with that name and said, okay, good enough.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.600
You know, we'll run with that.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:29.840
And as it turned out, the TurboGears guys, you know, I think Mark got another job, and he wasn't quite as involved with TurboGears.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:35.920
And they, you know, maintained their own projects, and they didn't come along.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.580
But anyway.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.680
But there's a little shared heritage there indeed.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.540
Okay, cool.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.580
So I've pip installed Pyramid.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.240
Right.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.460
And now what's my next step?

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.000
Well, so you mentioned a word.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.960
That's what I was going to say.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.380
You mentioned a word called scaffolding.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:17:04.900
We have these commands that once you install Pyramid, they are in Python, well, in setup tools terms, called console scripts.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:14.280
And all that means is they end up in the bin directory, you know, B-I-N, bin directory of your Python installation when you install Pyramid.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.220
Right.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.000
So it almost adds, like, new commands.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:21.520
After I pip install Pyramid, I can, like, pcreate and pserve and things like that, right?

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.840
Exactly, yeah.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:29.780
And those commands used to actually all be subcommands.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:37.940
You know, you know, over the course of the pyramid compatible with Python 3.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:50.160
And we were using a piece of software that Ian Bickman had originally written called Paste, and PasteScript and PasteDeploy and a number of other things.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.820
We still use one of those packages because it's a lot of things like that.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.580
We still use one of those packages because it's Python 3.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:53.820
And we still use one of those packages because it's Python 3.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:53.820
And we still use one of those packages because it's Python 3.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:54.320
And we still use one of those packages because it's Python 3.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.260
And we still use one of those packages because it's Python 3.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.900
The one that we do use is called PasteDeploy, and somebody else maintains that right now.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:07.800
But Paste and PasteScript were just – they just had too much stuff in them that we didn't use to port them over.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:25.960
So, you know, what I wound up doing was I copied all the code, basically, you know, and just kind of copied the stuff we needed into Pyramid and made these commands, these console scripts called, you know, the one that we were just talking about that creates projects from scaffolds, which are just kind of like templates of projects.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.740
It's called pcreate.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:37.420
And what you used to do when you installed Pyramid was you used to type something like paste or create, you know, project name, whatever.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:46.220
And then when you wanted to go to a project, you would type paste or serve and then the name of a .ini file, and it would serve up the application.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.360
All we did was we sort of pulled those things out.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.460
Now you type pcreate.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.820
That makes project from a scaffold.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.200
And you type pserve to serve the project.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.700
And it's all still Ian's code.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.200
It's just only what we needed.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.000
Right.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.320
Excellent.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.600
And so if I type pcreate, I have to give it a scaffold name or type.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.820
These are like pre-built little websites that I can start from.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.620
And there's three, right?

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.980
Yeah.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.900
There's an Alchemy one.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.520
There's a ZDB one.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.480
And there is a starter one.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.100
And the starter one is the very simplest thing.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.080
It is not bound to any particular database at all.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.100
And it's just, you know, basically one view.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:31.980
And inside of a, you know, a views.py file, for better or worse, and an init.py file.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.040
And basically when you go there, it just shows you a hello world page.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.740
And that's the very simplest thing.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:43.660
The other ones have, you know, they're still very simple.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.740
And they're just toys.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.820
You know, they're not full applications or anything.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.280
They don't really do anything.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.440
But they set up bindings to a database, more or less.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.220
The Alchemy one, which uses SQLAlchemy.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:02.760
And the ZDB one, I'm probably the only one who's ever used that one.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.120
But I'm a big fan of ZDB, so I put it in there.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.060
Yeah, that's excellent.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:13.000
We're going to actually have Mike Bayer, who did SQLAlchemy on in one of the next shows.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.740
So that'll be great.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.800
That's great.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.200
Yeah, yeah.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.060
That piece of software is really, really good.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:25.260
And Mike spends so much time trying to make it better and answer everybody's questions and everything.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.400
And he should be applauded.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.260
Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.700
I think it's a thing of beauty.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:36.220
That said, I usually start from the starter one if I'm working with Pyramid because I do a lot with them.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:41.120
Do you find that the scaffold is useful?

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:41.820
I mean…

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.960
I absolutely find it useful.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.480
I mean there's all these little pieces you've got to wire together.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.720
It creates your little static section.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.000
You know, it kind of gives you the right structure and just a little bit of guidance.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.760
You know, it sets up your setup.py and your under-under init and all that kind of stuff for you.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.420
So, yeah, I do find it useful.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.460
That's good.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:22.840
I think there's another thing I should probably either mention or defend or apologize for, whatever I have to do for it, which is that, you know, like for better or worse, I said, you know, we embrace setup tools to install Pyramid and its dependencies way early on.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.180
We also embrace setup tools to set up projects.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:32.340
So, when you create, when you use that pcreate command, you say pcreate starter, you know, and then you give it a name.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:40.000
And what it does is it creates a directory in the current working directory and that becomes your project.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.080
And literally, in terms of setup tools, it is called a project.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:51.000
You know, it's a directory on disk that has a setup.py in it, which is a setup tools thing, disk utils thing.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.560
Yeah, it's basically a package, right?

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.000
That's right.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:04.460
There is, well, it's a little tricky because, you know, there's PyPI, P-Y-P-I, you know, the index server for packages.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:09.020
And, you know, it's called the Python package index.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.220
But the things that it serves are actually technically not packages.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:19.080
That's a word reserved for, you know, directories on disk that have an initpy in them, you know, Python.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:19.400
Python.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:26.620
What P-Y-P-I should be called is P-Y-D-I, Python Distribution Index.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.380
But no one, you know, that ship is long-sailed.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.540
We're way past that, aren't we?

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.100
Right.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:42.600
So, yes, in common parlance, you know, it is a package, which means it has a, you know, it can be turned.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:55.360
Technically, it's a project until you run the setuppy sdist or however you package it up to put it somewhere so that it's installable through easy install or pip.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.540
Right.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.020
Okay.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.880
But inside of that thing, so it makes a directory.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.760
Inside of that directory is a setup.py that has a bunch of setup tool stuff in it.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:24.300
And for better or worse, I think that's the thing that people tend to trip over the most or that's, you know, and it's, you know, we try to make it as sort of, you know, we try to explain it as best we can in the docs and put comments in the code and, you know, the thing that gets run by the scaffolding.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.260
So that people understand what's going on.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:32.180
But, you know, the state of Python packaging is still just kind of funky.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.320
And I think it'll be kind of funky forever, you know.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:46.040
And I think the, you know, one thing that, you know, this is something you asked earlier about something that's different between, you know, something like Flask and Pyramid.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.660
Flask doesn't do any of this.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:54.120
You know, Flask says, hey, you know, open a file, start typing.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.120
You know what I mean?

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.700
Right.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.580
Or, you know, I'm sure there's some example projects you can get and stuff.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:05.400
But, you know, and people, that is much easier.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.020
It is much easier to get started with.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.960
And you can actually do that with Pyramid as well.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.840
You can open a file, start typing.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.420
You don't need any of this package nonsense and everything.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:26.420
But the thing is that what I've found is that, you know, applications that grow beyond, you know, a few views and whatever tend to need some structure, you know.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:33.740
And I'm not sure that there's any purpose in not putting it inside of a, you know, a project folder with a set of tools.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.520
Right.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.980
It lets you do cool stuff like say, hey, this website depends on these other packages.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.960
That's right.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.480
And it just automatically sort of pulls everything it needs in to run.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.900
So it's not, you know, tricky and hidden deep down in some import statement.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.800
Yeah, and you can, you know, you can run the tests through the set of PyPy file if you have tests.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:59.960
And you can create a, you know, a package, you know, and upload it to PyPy.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.180
And it's just like any other package.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.200
You can be your own package author and put stuff up on PyPy.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.020
Yeah, excellent.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:09.160
Okay, so I've gone to done pip install pyramid.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.940
And then maybe I've done pcreate, what is it, dash s, like start.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.360
That's right.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.940
And that'll generate it.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.360
And it's almost ready to run.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.500
But then I need to kind of somehow get that package, like registered.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.140
That's right.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:22.520
Yeah.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:30.400
So this is, you know, the thing that you create by running the pcreate command, like I said, as a project.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.620
And the way that you install the project is by typing Python setuppy either.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:40.300
My recommendation is typing Python setuppy develop, which.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:45.240
Yeah, that's the one I've been using as well, because it leaves the files there on the disk.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:52.840
The ones that you're working on are the ones that it runs from, as opposed to install, which copies it to what is that your site packages folder or something like that.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.680
That's right.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.400
Yeah, that's right.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:08.340
And when you type Python setuppy install, it actually, you know, you can you can then, you know, if you're curious, you can change directories to your Python site packages folder, which is, you know, somewhere under your Python's lib directory.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:18.180
And after you type Python setuppy install, you will see either a tarball or directory that represents your project.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:24.280
And alongside of all the other software you might have installed from third parties, it's just like any other any other thing.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:29.660
But when you type Python setuppy develop, it doesn't put anything in your site packages.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:38.280
And and sort of if it needs to need any dependencies for better or worse, it puts them in the in the same directory as setuppy.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.220
I never quite understood that, but it does that.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:51.400
And it also puts into your easy install dot there's a there's a there's a there's a file in your I guess I guess it's also in site packages.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:58.140
Yeah, I think it's like a sort of link back says, hey, look over for this dot eggs folder here rather than like in the site packages.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.440
It's not a sub folder, but it's like external or something.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.480
It's called like easy install dot PTH.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:11.800
And, you know, all this all this stuff is just like, you know, ancient, you know, rhyme of the ancient mariner stuff from from setup tools.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.980
You know, it's just been passed down through the ages, you know.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:23.900
And, you know, the reason these things exist, these PTH files is because they are consulted at an appropriate time when Python starts.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.240
And they are meant to Python.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:35.640
Python will look for them inside of site packages or inside of, you know, the I think Python calls them the dist folders or whatever.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.200
But usually it's just called site packages.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.400
And it will read these files.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:48.400
And these files are meant to have just just like directory names in them more or less to say, OK, this is the when when Python starts,

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.780
I'm going to add these to the sys path of this of this Python interpreter.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:58.980
And but it turned out that somebody made a mistake and you could actually put Python code in there.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:59.720
Oh, boy.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:08.700
So so if you if you look inside of easy install dot PTH thing, Philip Eby took serious advantage of that, you know, when he wrote setup tools.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:16.560
And it's got it's got some some Python, inscrutable Python in there that does some fun stuff.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.500
I think it sets up package resources on there.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.020
Go ahead.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:20.300
Sorry.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.620
Yeah, no, that's interesting.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.600
That's pretty interesting.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.380
So I've I've got it.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.380
I think we're basically there.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:27.560
Right.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.500
You've you've said set up that PY --develop.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:37.220
And that'll sort of register my site with the Python implementation that I'm using.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.540
So Python two or Python three.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.420
And then I just want to run it.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.660
So that's P serve.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:48.380
And then you guys have any files, one for at least in the scaffolds, one for deployment or one for dev and one for production.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:48.660
Right.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.840
That's right.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.220
That's right.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.420
And the scaffold, the difference between the two.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:29:08.480
The main difference between the two is that when you run the development one, it will install this piece of software called the well, it will include this piece of software called the pyramid debug toolbar, which is pretty handy to use.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.780
That pyramid debug toolbar is super cool.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.140
I mean, you think of a debug toolbar, maybe it gives you a little log or something.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:18.540
But after I looked in there, I'm like, wow, this really reaches down into a lot of areas.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:24.280
Performance, SQLAlchemy queries, logging errors, request time and performance.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.940
What what view template was selected?

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.980
There's a lot of stuff in there.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.320
There is.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.980
And I mean, I think I would like to take credit for most of that.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:41.800
But the original version of that was a blatant ripoff of something that was in Flask, actually.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.500
And in turn, that thing that was in Flask was a blatant ripoff of something that was in Django.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.820
They actually even had the same UI like they were the same thing, you know.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:51.360
Yeah.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:51.840
For a while.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.400
That's cool.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:52.920
Wow.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.800
Yeah, I kind of thought they had some Django heritage in there somewhere.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.280
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:03.600
And and, you know, so those guys, you know, the original author of the Django thing.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.940
God, I don't remember who it was, but I remember the guy, the guy who did it for Flask.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.120
His name his name is Matt Mantellogen, I think.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.860
I'm sorry, Matt, if I'm brutalizing your name.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:22.600
It was it was nicely done, you know, and I understood it and, you know, just basically just stole it in a couple of days and had it going.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:32.300
Since then, though, since, you know, that that sort of iteration of that project, I no longer sort of did much on it and other people picked it up.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:37.020
And since then, it's gotten I think it's gotten way better and it's and it's sort of outgrown.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.060
It's it's derivative nature.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.080
It's you know, it's it's different than the other ones.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:52.860
Now, it actually keeps track of past requests and you can go back and look at, you know, headers of some number of requests and it uses SSE to it's it's it's it's really neat.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.700
It's really I was really blown away to see how much was behind that little toolbar.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.100
That's cool.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:11.460
So one of the things sorry, one of the things that drew me to Pyramid was it's sort of full support for Python 3, whereas, you know, at the time when I was getting started at these, I looked at Flask and it was kind of like, well, it may run on Pyramid 3.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.620
It's not really supported and some of the other web frameworks.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:20.980
And so I think your support for Python 3 is really a nice sort of contribution towards trying to move everything forward.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:36.400
Well, actually, the credit for that probably belongs mostly to the PSF, Python, Python Software Foundation, because, you know, we pyramid itself, you know, pyramid itself is pretty small.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.580
I mean, it's it's not very big.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:43.900
You know, it's it's it's at this point, maybe, I don't know, 15,000, 20,000 lines.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.160
I'm probably going to look at it and I'll make a liar of myself.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.380
But it's it's not that big anyway.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:32:02.040
But it has dependencies, you know, it has it has a dependency on a package on a package called WebOB, which was also written by the super productive Ian Bicking, who is we've lost to JavaScript at this point.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:07.920
But WebOB is this is this implementation of sort of HTTP request response library.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:22.160
And it just it was kind of sitting unmaintained because, you know, Ian went to work for Mozilla and, you know, he was doing JavaScript stuff and just not it wasn't in his, you know, interest anymore to keep it up.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:27.200
So we sort of ended up just well, that's not that's not true.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.900
Another I shouldn't have shouldn't have said that.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:35.080
Another guy, Sergei, took it over for a while and he did a did a great job sort of, you know, shepherding it along.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.720
And then he he moved on.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.900
You know, maybe he got another job where it wasn't so important anymore or whatever.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.140
And so it kind of wound up in the pylons project.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.080
So now now we're the owners of WebOB.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:56.160
And that was, you know, that was Python to only library, you know, in 2010, I guess, 2011.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:03.200
And so that was that was the first thing that we had to port in order to start to port pyramid.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.320
Right. Because if you're going to port it, you got to start at the bottom and everything it builds on also has to move on over.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.400
Right. So that's a little project.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.420
It's not just your 20,000 lines of code.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.540
It's 20,000 lines plus foundation.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.620
Yes. Yeah.

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:26.860
And so that so I I was whining heavily about that because, you know, I mean, it's, you know, I think.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:37.360
You know, for better or worse, you know, you want you want to sort of move along with the with the with language, you know, where you want to be where the language is going to be.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:44.180
But, you know, economically, it's really difficult to think about doing that.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:57.340
You know, I mean, you have you have you have to spend, you know, sometimes weeks, you know, to to to especially especially especially if the thing doesn't have good test coverage, because, you know, when you go to port something to Python 3, it's not really porting it to Python 3.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:01.720
It's it's it's actually making it run on both Python 2 and Python 3.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.740
So you're kind of straddling.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.340
Right. That's an even more interesting problem because, you know.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:06.840
Yeah.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.620
And sort of polyfill all that stuff back in.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.860
Yeah. Yeah. That's that's a great word. Yeah.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.920
I mean, it's almost exactly the same the same thing.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:22.240
So I was whining about having to do that, you know, and I was going to do it anyway.

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:31.260
But I think either Alex Keener or Nick Coghlan called call me out on it and said, look, you know, the PSF has grants for this stuff.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.340
This kind of stuff was like, really?

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:38.200
Like and I think, you know, I I asked them, I applied for a grant and they gave it to me.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.740
And I was, you know, it was it really, really wouldn't matter how much it was.

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.560
You know what I mean?

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.880
It was just something, you know, just some amount of money I could say went towards that.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.760
And I could I could be paid.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.660
I think I think they gave us like three thousand dollars or something.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.640
That's cool.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.100
What the PSF is doing lately is really cool.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.240
They seem to be doing a lot to support the community.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:03.740
and kind of guide it and sort of with these little little gentle pushes.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.940
Yeah.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.740
And I, you know, I really appreciated it.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:12.620
And I I still from time to time whine about that stuff because still there, you know,

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.860
I'm dragging along 10 years of Python history.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.700
You know what I mean?

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:22.580
I mean, at this point, I've just had to sort of like drop some like drop some friends, you know.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.000
Sorry, I can't talk to you anymore.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.780
You know, I can't think about this.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.620
I can't I can't think about porting this to Python 3.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.480
So I'm, you know, whatever.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.520
But but I think it's getting a lot better.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:37.280
And I think, you know, with these frameworks, you know, the web stuff, at least at least

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.260
the web portion of the world, I think, is pretty much OK on Python 3.

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:46.060
You know, if you're going to start a new project, I don't think you're going to have a lot, you

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.660
know, too many problems starting on Python 3.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:49.620
Yeah.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.860
A lot a lot of the cloud providers are starting to support it.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:57.360
Last year, I believe Azure had no option for Python 3, but now they do.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.840
Python Anywhere has some fantastic support and it's starting to get easier.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.600
And then, you know, with the advent of Docker, you have a lot more control over your actual runtime.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.460
You can kind of drop Python 3 in there and you don't have to ask permission.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:12.460
That's your little container.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.280
Do what you want, you know?

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.340
Yeah.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:14.420
Yeah.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:14.700
Yeah.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:21.380
And so I think just from from both the standpoint of deployment, like you just said, and the

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:26.760
standpoint of development where you need some library, you know, some library at this

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.100
point, you you're going to you're going to run it.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.320
You're probably going to run into one thing that's that only runs on Python 2 and and you're

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.940
going to gnash your teeth and and whatever.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:40.240
But maybe not, you know, maybe not if you're if it's really vanilla.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.140
You know, you don't need some Excel import libraries.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.040
I mean, but people need that stuff.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:51.160
You know, people it's it's a it's a long tail of of stuff that people often need when they

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.440
build stuff and they often run into problems.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.900
So and all that stuff hasn't quite caught up yet, but it's it's getting better.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:02.720
So I don't think there's any reason at this point in the web world anyway to think about

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.440
starting a new project with Python 2.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:09.380
So speaking of sort of Python 3 and looking towards the future and things moving ahead, you

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:14.020
know, what's your sort of view of the future of web frameworks in Python?

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.680
I think they're going to probably become a lot less interesting.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:24.580
You know, I think of the of the frameworks that have it probably, you know, most right at

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.060
this point.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:29.940
It's it's probably, you know, bottle flask pyramid sort of frameworks that are that are pretty

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:36.360
small and don't do a lot and and are just just, you know, places to hang code that gets

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.200
called and returns from JSON more or less.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.980
I think that's probably going to be the major way we build applications and all the all the

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.540
gnarly stuff will probably be on the on the client end.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.740
Of course, there's always going to be, you know, there's always going to be server side

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.880
code that's running.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.960
But I think we'll see a lot less of templating templating languages in particular, more JSON,

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.140
less HTML and lighter weight, smaller building blocks, something like that.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:07.220
The applications, the applications that people want to build are really for phones.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.080
You know, people want to build applications that run on many platforms.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.300
I mean, they still have to run on a desktop and everything.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:19.980
But if you'll notice, you know, some very, very big sites now are are very clearly sort

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:25.500
of, you know, optimized, not optimized, but, you know, they they they are.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.660
What's the word response?

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:33.000
They have responsive design for for both phones, tablets and the desktop.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
You know, like if you go to orbits, for example, orbits dot com.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.060
It looks terrible on a desktop.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.740
It's awful, you know, but it looks good on a phone.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.980
Yeah, it used to be it used to be much easier to use, you know, but really what people want

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:51.480
is just a way to maintain this stuff so that they don't have to write, you know, the desktop

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.860
app and the desktop web application and the phone web application and everything.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:39:01.960
And there are so many more phones these days than there are computers that that, you know,

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.800
they already know how to do UI.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:08.800
You know, they have a they have a UI layer built into them and they they don't need

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.640
HTML.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.920
It's nice to be able to use it if you if you have a web view on the phone or whatever.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:18.000
So I think I think anyway, I'll be cut that short, but I think that's the way it's going

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:18.200
to go.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.060
OK, yeah, that's very interesting.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.160
And there's you know, you see the sort of hosting services popping up to be just the back

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.340
end for phones.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:30.180
And that could be from a Cordova HTML based phone app or it could be like a Swift iOS app.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.340
Yeah, that's I'm thinking of like Azure Mobile Services or Parse.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.540
Parse, which was acquired by Facebook.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.140
And some of these guys are really doing interesting stuff.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.080
Can you speak about any like well-known deployments other than, of course, talk python to me dot com,

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.960
which I'm ranking up there.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.760
But I've seen that on Alexa.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.220
I think that's like number three.

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.460
It's probably three or two.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.440
I haven't checked today.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.760
I haven't checked today.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.180
I can actually.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.600
I didn't know.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.780
It was really funny.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:05.820
I was reading Reddit and I saw an article about Yelp infrastructure.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.080
And I was like, oh, I'll go check that out.

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.920
Sounds interesting.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:14.000
It was they were talking about how they had deployed a service oriented architecture infrastructure.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:23.260
And so I read through it and halfway through it, I'm like, they said, our, you know, server, you know, Python backend server stuff is built on pyramid.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.060
I was like, well, I had no idea.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.320
That's pretty fantastic.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.980
Yeah, that was that was great.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:35.080
So when you go to Yelp, I think if that article is true, I haven't I haven't spoken to anybody.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.160
I have no idea how accurate it is.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.840
But I think all that stuff runs a pyramid.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:48.000
There are a number of other sort of, you know, well, far lesser known sites that I've developed.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.980
If you go to environmental health sciences dot org, that's a that's a pyramid site.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:58.960
If you go to Carl project dot org, that's a pyramid site.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.900
We've we've worked on these projects.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:06.160
And I think some other folks have, you know, a little bit.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.780
Oh, survey survey monkey.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.980
Oh, yeah.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:09.580
Survey monkey.

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.120
That's cool.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.140
Survey monkey is a local company for me here in Portland.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.400
So I know those guys.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.600
Oh, that's right.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.100
Yeah.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.280
They have they have an office.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.940
Is I don't know if their headquarters is.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.180
I'm not sure where their headquarters is.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.300
I just know is walking around town like, oh, wait, they're they're here.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:24.660
They're for them.

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.120
That's interesting.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.400
Yeah, I think I I've been to their San Francisco office, which is beautiful.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.420
Sorry, Palo Alto office, which is beautiful.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.880
And I know a lot of those guys there.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.760
Some of cars dot com is pyramid.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.620
I know a guy there who's a fantastic supporter of pyramid.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.320
Hello, Michael.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.980
Michael Ryabushkin, also known as Goodwill.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.640
He hangs out on IRC a lot and he he organizes a lot of stuff for us.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:42:02.180
And just most recently he is he got cars dot com to sponsor a the graphics and display

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:06.520
artwork and stuff for a booth at PyCon for us.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:06.840
And he did.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.400
He's done it for like three years in a row.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.360
Oh, that's fantastic.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.260
And and he is a he is a great supporter of pyramid.

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.060
He does a great job.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:19.360
The other, you know, over Christmas time, he sent me a monitor in the mail just showed

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:19.580
up.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.560
Wow.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.460
That's really generous.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.400
Yeah.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.380
So so, you know, I'm I'm really I'm really lucky that that people like him around and other

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.440
people have done the same.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:32.380
I've had people send me send me several hundred dollars, you know, just out of the blue.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:32.980
Just wow.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.380
That's great.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.680
It's like thanks for thanks for building this great framework.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.600
Yeah, that's right.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.780
Our company runs on it.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:38.740
So, you know, cheers.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.900
Yeah, it's really humbling.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.160
You know, I was I was saying about cars dot com.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.560
I think some of that runs on it and I'm sure there's other people.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.480
I'm sure I'm forgetting somebody.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.680
Yeah, I'm sure there's there's there's a whole bunch of sites that don't talk about what the

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.180
infrastructure is that are probably.

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:52.800
Yeah.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.400
Yeah.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:59.180
I think I think for sure there are still more Django sites, you know, high profile Django

00:42:59.180 --> 00:42:59.840
sites, I think.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.300
Yeah, I'm sure there are.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.160
So, you know, people who are out there listening, if you've got like a cool, well-known site, maybe

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:09.480
you should email Chris and just say, hey, Chris, you know, such and such runs on

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.120
pyramid as well.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.960
And I will forget about that like I forgot about all the other ones as well.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.220
No problem.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:16.820
I can forget for you all day long.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:17.560
Perfect.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.040
All right.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.420
Well, I think that that's a lot of interesting stuff about pyramid.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.420
Is there anything else you'd like to kind of add?

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.800
Yes, I would.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:32.760
Actually, I am the originator of, you know, I started the first file in the project and all

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.040
that stuff.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:37.980
But over the last year or so, I have had to go and work.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:41.180
You know, I've had work to do and I took some time off.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:47.920
And I've I've I sort of didn't do as much on pyramid or any of any of the other pylons

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.560
projects projects.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.580
There are a group of guys.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.740
Michael miracle is he's on.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.420
I should say this.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.600
There is a there is a pyramid IRC channel that if you're interested in pyramid on free

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.620
know that you should probably get into.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.780
He's I'm I'm M.C.D.O.N.C.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.520
And they're McDunk.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:09.500
And the guy, Michael miracle, who is also a core maintainer.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.440
His name is radio.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.060
R.A.Y.D.E.O.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:20.940
And there's a guy who now is kind of I think we tricked him into maintaining Webob.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.520
His name is Berger's year.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.080
I'm sure I'm murdering his name.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.440
But he's he's he's he's Norwegian.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.360
So I'm allowed to do that.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.160
God, I hope he's Norwegian now.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.740
He's Scandinavian in some sense.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:33.240
I don't know.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:33.960
That's great.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.680
So some people are coming along to pick up the effort.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.420
Yeah.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:43.080
And and and really, I am I am I have contributed far less than those people have.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.520
And there's other guys, you know, John Anderson.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.820
There's a bunch of guys in there that really picked up the slack when I when I sort of, you

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.740
know, wandered, did a bit of a walkabout.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.840
I'm getting back into it now.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:57.820
But there's those guys are really the guys who've been carrying them, carrying the water

00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.280
for for at least a year now.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:05.400
OK, do you guys do you have any future releases coming up that you guys have like a roadmap for

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.900
you can talk about or is that still?

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:12.600
Yeah, no, I think I think I'm hoping, you know, as we record this, it is it is April 6th

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:18.580
and and PyCon starts on April 9th, maybe even earlier than I think about it.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.380
Yeah, maybe April.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.220
I think it's Wednesday, actually, possibly.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.140
OK, maybe people arrive on Wednesday.

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:23.580
I'm not sure.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.360
But it's definitely coming in fast.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.320
Yeah.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:33.980
And I'm sort of closing last issues now that I hope will let us have a release by PyCon of

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:39.480
Pyramid 1.6, which has a bunch of new shiny features in it and and and stuff.

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.760
So that should that should be good.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.640
That's great.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.820
Well, by the time this comes out, people will it maybe will be already out.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:46.900
So that'd be great.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.040
Yeah.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:52.080
So go go go go check out look for Pyramid 1.6.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:52.720
Yes.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.620
Yes, definitely.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.500
All right.

00:45:54.500 --> 00:46:00.660
Is there any final person or thing you want to give a shout out to somewhere you want to draw the listeners attention to?

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:04.360
Well, if you're if you're if you're interested, you should go to pylons project dot org.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.500
That is the main site for all this stuff.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:12.800
And you'll see pyramid and you'll see Web of and a bunch of other things listed on there and documentation.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:20.800
And that's the that's the place to go and and visit the RC channel, the pound pyramid channel in free node RC.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:26.100
And those are the places you can come and talk to us and make us laugh.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:32.520
And and also I wanted to give you a shout out because I think I think you're I'm really happy that there's a new Python podcast.

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.780
I I will listen to all the other episodes.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.540
I will not listen to this one because I'm terrified of hearing myself.

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.480
Well, thank you so much.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.420
I really appreciate your kind words and the community support has been really amazing.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:49.200
Like the amount of messages I got on Twitter saying thanks for creating a new Python podcast have been really overwhelming.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.080
So, you know, that that's great.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.360
And I really appreciate it.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.380
Chris, thank you for being on the show.

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.720
This is this is really interesting.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.640
I'm a big fan of pyramid and use it for a couple of projects.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.020
And I definitely definitely recommend people check it out on your docs.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:07.860
I thought you have some really nice sort of tutorial walkthroughs that were quite easy to get started with.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.460
So well done on the docs as well.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.700
And thanks for being on the show.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.980
Thank you.

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:12.560
I appreciate it.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.620
Thanks very much for having me.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.060
Yeah.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:14.640
Talk to you later.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.560
Bye bye.

Smix.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.040
Take us out of here.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.320
Staying with my voice.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.120
There's no norm that I can feel within.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.320
Haven't been sleeping.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.940
I've been using lots of rest.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:56.800
I'll pass the mic back to who rocked it best.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:56.800
I'll pass the mic back to who rocked it best.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:09.060
I'll pass the mic back to who rocked it best.

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:09.560

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:39.540
Thank you.
