00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.580
This episode is a special crossover from my Python Bytes podcast that I co-host with Brian

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:04.840
Aukin.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.640
It's got a different vibe than the interview shows here and short topics coming in fast

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.080
and quick.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.440
If you haven't listened before, I think you're going to enjoy it.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.640
So here are a bunch of excellent Python tips and tools to close out the year.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.000
See you all in the first week of January.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.080
And while I'm talking directly to you, thank you very, very much for taking the time to

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.560
listen to my shows and support all of my projects.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.320
Cheers.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.100

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.580
This is episode 365.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.660
Wow.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.500
Recorded.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.620
It's like we've been doing it for a year.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.080
Yeah.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.880
Recorded December 19th, 2023.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.640
Yeah.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.960
And I'm Brian Okken.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.940
Hey, I'm Michael Kennedy.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.260
And yeah, if we did it, if somebody listened to one a day from now on, they would be behind

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.180
because we'll be way ahead of 365 by the time they finish.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.800
But yeah.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.440
Still be awesome.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.000
Well, want to kick us off with something cool?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.280
Oh, before we kick it off.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.120
Yeah, go ahead.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.680
Let's say that this episode is sponsored by us.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.720
So please support us and other people.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.880
I'm going to talk about that a little bit later at the end of the show.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.620

And we're all on Fosstodon, or at least Michael and I are.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.320

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.440
Kennedy, at Brian Okken, and at Python Bytes.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.640
Indeed.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.160
Hey, do I feel like I'm really fast, Brian?

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.640
Like Neo in the Matrix?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.340
Mind-bendingly fast?

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.540
Let's go with yes.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.180
Okay.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.300
I appreciate that.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.540
Because I just got fiber, gigabit fiber installed 30 minutes ago.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.060
I was hoping it wouldn't destroy the show, but it almost didn't make it, but it made it.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.000
Ooh, nice.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.140
So hopefully that doesn't curse it, that something doesn't go wrong and it will crash.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.820
But 950 megabit down, which is fine, but 950 megabit up is glorious.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.180
We should speed up the playback speed when we release the MP3 so it sounds really fast.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.400
No, we're talking really fast because it's really uploading.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.860
Yeah.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.540
No, let's talk about Hatch, because Hatch is awesome.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.140
OFEC is the maintainer-creator of Hatch, and boy, oh boy, has he gone big on his latest release,

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.440
1.8.0.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.980
So Hatch is like Flit, is like PDM, is like pip, ENV, and many of these other poetry, others.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.600
If I'm leaving your version of this out, I apologize.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.200
But with version 1.8, this has gone in a bit of a different direction.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.220
You know, I had OFEC on the Python packaging panel.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.780
I think Steve Dower was there.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.800
Some other folks were there.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.340
Really interesting that there's this tension between should there be an app that manages

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.900
Python environments with Python, or should there be a thing that manages the Python itself,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.460
right?

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.340
Kind of like PyEMV, for example, right?

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.980
So Hatch has gone in that direction of now Hatch manages Python, not just Python projects.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.600
And there's this thing to solve this problem in the form of PyApp.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.680
So PyApp is even maybe more awesome.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.420
PyApp is a runtime installer for Python projects written in Rust, and they can be, you ready

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.780
for this?

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.300
I'm so, so excited.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.480
Your Python app can be distributed as a standalone executable, a .exe or .app for users.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.340
What do you think, Brian?

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.940
I'm very interested in finding out more.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.500
Now, this whole post is a little bit wordy.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.960
So let me jump into the omnivore version of it over here, which has a huge icon.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.360
So Ofex says, look, one of the things that's been a perpetual problem for Hatch and all the

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.980
others I named is that Python itself is a dependency.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.380
So in order to use Hatch or any of these other tools or any apps, you have to say, well, go

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.140
get Python and then get back to me and we'll start talking, right?

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.060
So he came up with this thing called PyApp that will create installers for the different

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.760
platforms.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.800
Claims it's trivial.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.240
It's probably never trivial, but possible.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.980
Possible would be awesome even.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.520
And so starting with this releases, not only are the binaries available for every platform,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.240
but there are installers as in like install wizards on Windows and a DMG type thing, I'm

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.480
guessing, or a PKG on macOS.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.140
But so the installer for the macOS is signed using the certificate from the same account used

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.220
to sign the official distributions of Python.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.660
So you won't get any security warnings or blocking.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.820
Thank you, Ederbin, for helping out with that.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.760
And Hatch itself with any good system is self-updating.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.420
So you can Hatch self-update.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.360
What else I want to point out?

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.900
There's also a new Python, like Hatch space Python command group that will allow you to

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.560
manage things.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.880
So you can show what you have installed.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.600
You can install different versions of Python, CPython and PyPy for those.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.420
Works with virtual environments.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.040
It has built in rough and Ruff format integrations.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:45.560
Traditionally, it's been somewhat slow to like activate and set up a virtual environment

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.760
that's already previously been installed because it'll refresh and recheck that all of the

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.020
dependencies are there and everything.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.120
So now it does a hash of those.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.260
And so only if the dependency statement doesn't match the hash, right?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.840
Basically, so it'll pre-compute all that stuff.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.920
So now it should be basically instant.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.140
So also some minor breaking changes around build defaults and the new app build targets,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.680
what I've been raving about.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.220
So OFAC, you killed it.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.880
Can't believe it.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.300
It's awesome.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.840
Awesome.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.120
So Hatch has hashes?

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:24.020
If you hash a hatch with hashling and, you know, like there's some kind of tongue twister

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.700
in there we could do.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.940
I'm not doing it though.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.280
Got to be.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.320
I'm excited about this.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.460
It's very cool.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.000
I definitely want to play with it.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.380
Yeah.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.140
Yes, indeed.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.440
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Posit, the makers of Shiny, formerly

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.800
RStudio and especially Shiny for Python.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.720
Let me ask you a question.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.420
Are you building awesome things?

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.480
Of course you are.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.040
You're a developer or a data scientist.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.960
That's what we do.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.100
And you should check out Posit Connect.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.720

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.980
building using Python.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.160
People ask me the same question all the time.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.320
Michael, I have some cool data science project or notebook that I built.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.620
How do I share it with my users, stakeholders, teammates?

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.420
Do I need to learn FastAPI or Flask or maybe Vue or React.js?

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.640
Hold on now.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.820
Those are cool technologies and I'm sure you'd benefit from them, but maybe stay focused on

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.440
the data project.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.920
Let Posit Connect handle that side of things.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.640

The link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.520
Thank you to the team at Posit for supporting Talk Python.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:08.360
I'm not sure how long this has been out, but Hinnick has been promoting a new project that

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:14.520
he's got called Services or SVCS, which is short for Services and pronounced services.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.880
And it is a, I think it could be used for more than web stuff.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:27.800
But the intent, I think, was for removing some labor plate code from hooking up dependencies

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:34.460
and different, like your database and your cache and all sorts of stuff to an application.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.920
Typically a web application, but I think it could really be anything.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.180
But it's a flexible service locator.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:47.680
And one of the reasons why I haven't covered it yet on Python Bytes, I don't think I have,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.340
is because I didn't quite understand what it was doing.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.000
And it took me a while to get my head around it.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.700
Why does this exist?

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.020
But it's pretty cool.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:01.760
And Hinnick apparently realizes that it is a bit difficult to get your head around what this

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.280
is doing.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.080
So he just recently released a video describing this project.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:16.960
So really great video describing services, what you can do with it, and also how to pronounce

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.380
his name.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.140
He doesn't pronounce his last name, though.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.080
Apparently that's left for maybe episode two.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.400
But Shalavak, I guess.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.840
Anyway, it's pretty cool.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.800
Actually, I'm pretty excited about it after watching it.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.320
Watching the video.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.380
I thought maybe it wouldn't be for me.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:42.340
But especially for keeping services contained or the setting up services, looking them up

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:48.160
within different parts of your application, and then getting them all cleaned up correctly

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:48.880
at the end.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.500
That's kind of what it does, plus a whole bunch of other stuff.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.460
And one of the neat things is throughout all of this documentation, the documentation is

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:55.860
amazing.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:04.140
Throughout all of this documentation, he has examples in AIo HTTP, FastAPI, Flask, Pyramid,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.720
and Starlet.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.920
Nice.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.520
And the video is talking about Flask, but it's cool that he just already hit all the bases.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.700
Like, how do I do this in Starlet?

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.620
Well, it's just a little different.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:21.560
Most of them, mostly they're similar, but little different ways to use it throughout the different

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.140
applications.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.400
So it's pretty cool.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:30.620
He also mentions in the video that he took a really long time really talking about the terminology

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.660
and the glossary of the documentation.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:39.480
And actually, I really appreciate this of somebody saying, okay, this is generally what I think

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.540
of as what the meanings for all of these words are.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:50.320
And a lot of these words are overused in the English language to begin with, and even in talking

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.640
about programming, web programming.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.340
But things like, what is a service?

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.400
What is a resource?

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.700
What is a dependency?

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.060
Service layer.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:02.180
He goes through a whole bunch of different terms, what it means to him and probably to everybody

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.640
else, but if you're unfamiliar with him.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.480
And even a decent discussion of dependency injection.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:13.800
So one of the things he talks about is that this is not really a dependency injection thing.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.740
It's inversion of control, but it's a little different than service.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.640
Service locators are a little different than dependency injection.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.300
And I kind of appreciate that discussion.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:23.940
It's pretty cool.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:29.600
So anyway, kudos to Hinnick for doing this and for helping us pronounce his name.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.060
Yeah, this looks cool.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.320
I definitely want to check this out.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.760
It's news to me, so I will be checking it out.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.120
Cool.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.780
Mm-hmm.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.400
We have new leaders, Brian.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.060
We do.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.720
Yes.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.820
For the Python world, we have new leaders.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:48.200
And specifically, the steering council election results are in for next year.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.780
Okay.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.160
So for the 2024 term, we have Pablo Galindo Salgado.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.900
We've got Gregory Smith, Emily Morehouse, Barry Warsaw, and Thomas Waters.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.060
So very cool to see them all leading the way.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.940
There's a lot of familiar faces there.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.580
So that's pretty cool.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:10.780
I don't expect a whole lot of different from the year before, but here's the results.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:19.640
You can actually see in PEP 8105, you see everybody who was potentially a candidate, how many votes

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.580
they got by people who are disenfranchised.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.380
I don't know what that means.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:28.380
Or the franchised voters, the one who are enfranchised, how many votes that they got.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.720
And you can put that all together.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.840
So this begs the question, like, well, how do you get on this list?

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.200
You get on this list by being nominated by a core developer.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.600
So everyone on the list was nominated by a core developer.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.300
If you are a core developer, you can nominate yourself.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.160
So that could be the person you see here, because everyone I see, I think, is a core developer.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.780
Okay.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.100
But anyway, the results, the results are in, and we have those five folks.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.480
Welcome and congrats.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:55.960
Awesome.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.720
Nice.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.300
That's a good set of names, too.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:58.780
Yeah.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.220
So.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:13:59.640
Yeah.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.260
All right.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.280
Indeed.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:07.360
Well, there probably is some protocol around the election results, right?

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.580
No, you could model it with classes, or you could functionally model it, like, in an immutable

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.280
way, but I don't know about a protocol.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:14.800
Okay.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.700
We're just great at transitions on this podcast.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.340
The next I want to talk about Python protocols.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:31.740
So there's an article from Carlos Vecina, I think, called Python protocols, defining a protocol

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.900
and when to use it.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:37.840
And actually, this is something that I have, I've been meaning to play with for actually

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.200
some years, and I haven't really done much with it yet.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.680
So I really appreciate this article.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:48.240
He's talking about protocols are a feature of Python that were added in Python 3.8.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.720
So really anything maintainable right now, you can use protocols.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:03.780
And you kind of, mentally, I think of them kind of like class inheritance or mix-ins or abstract

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.520
base classes.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:10.680
And that's one of the things he talks about in this article is they are in that same similar

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.340
space, but you use them a little different.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.900
And you might use them together with other forms too, like with mix-ins and abstract base

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.280
classes.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.020
So the article just goes through on how to define a protocol.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:29.000
And really, and he's also discussed also a decent tutorial on abstract base classes and mix-ins

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.040
as well, which is nice to kind of describe them all together.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.340
But the protocol thing is just sort of, let me see if I can find an example.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:44.540
So you inherit, you have a class that's inherited from protocol and you give it, you kind of give

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.160
it function definitions, but don't fill in the body.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.160
So that's kind of what a protocol is.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:56.940
And then other classes that use the protocol derive from that protocol.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:02.440
From like in his example, there's a class called explainable, something that has an explained

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:02.860
function.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:11.000
And so you would derive from explainable and then your new class would be a instance of

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.640
a protocol.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.680
But all it really says is that you can, other places that use it for types and stuff can

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.380
declare that they need a protocol passed in or a explainable class.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.480
And then you can use anything that derives from that.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.620
So pretty cool.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.180
Yeah, Brian, let me jump in and just say one extra point here.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.380
Like what's awesome about this stuff is we've had duck typing like this.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:38.120
There's an assess fairness function that it has to call explain on the object passed in.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.680
And duck typing said, well, if it takes that, if you can pass it in there and it will run

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.480
when you call explain on it, it must fit.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:44.800
Right.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.680
But the typing tools don't check.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.260
So like PyCharm, for example, would just go, well, it's a whatever.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.320
So good luck with that.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.100
But once you do this protocol stuff, if you say the function takes an explainable and you

00:16:55.100 --> 00:17:00.300
have explainable as a protocol, you can pass stuff in and it doesn't even have to derive

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.840
from or be related to that protocol in a base class.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.120
Like anything that is passed in there, the type system will look at it and verify it hasn't

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.360
explained, even if it's in a third party package and you don't control it.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.720
So it's like a way to project typing structure onto a dynamic thing that is not necessarily

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.260
your code.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:17.740
It's wild.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.660
Oh, cool.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.740
I kind of had that a little bit wrong then.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.280
Awesome.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.360
You can drive from it.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.060
It gives you more information potentially, but.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.120
It doesn't have to be.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.280
You don't even have to, which that's the totally wild aspect.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.140
That's what I think is really different for this.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:30.580
Okay.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.240
Yeah.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.260
Oh, awesome.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.100
That's pretty cool.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:33.540
No.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.060
Yeah.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:40.100
So clearly I haven't thoroughly read this article, but I do want to get into really getting my

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.620
head around abstract based classes, mix ins and protocols and stuff.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.340
And partly.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.000
I wouldn't say that though, because like your experiences in C++, mine also is in C++ and C

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.740
sharp and all of those languages have these interface ideas, but there's, they're, they're put

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.180
into the type system through inheritance.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.820
And so you can inherit from it and it does what you expect.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.680
And it seems the right thing, but what's weird is you don't even have to.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.920
That's what's weird about it.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.200
Okay.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:02.460
Cool.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.420
Oh, awesome.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.640
Ah, now I definitely want to play with it more.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.680
Um, yeah.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.920
Cause I've kind of missed that aspect of C++ in Python.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.260
Yeah.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.960
Um, so nice.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:18.300
Anyway, also, I'm assuming it's a AI generated image, but really cool image at the top of the

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.020
article.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:19.560
It's good.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.440
I don't, I'm not sure what my opinion is about it.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.260
I'll ask ChatGPT, how I feel about it.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.540
It's hard to describe how I feel.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:31.420
So I'll, you know, yeah, I'm actually sort of, I don't know, this is a tangent, but I've

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:37.080
switched to, was, was playing with like Bing is my primary search engine at work.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.480
I just, I don't know that a new computer, it just was there and I'm just going with it for

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.880
a while, but everything I search is like, it gives me an AI generated answer first.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.180
And I'm like, I don't, I don't know if I like that very much.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.080
Yeah, I know.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:50.640
I know.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.960
Anyway, well, that's, that's it for our main stuff.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.000
Do you have any extras?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.200
I could have almost made it an extra, extra, extra this time.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:58.660
So yeah, sure.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:58.960
I do.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.520
First of all, I've been wanting to say this several times and I'm usually like looking at

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.580
my screen and see what I want to share and stuff.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.780
And I didn't have this anywhere.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.140
So I just pulled up Mastodon to remind me there are tons of people interacting with us

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.040
over on Mastodon.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.220
And I've had some great conversations and I want to, I'm sure you do too, Brian, want to

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.820
follow people back, but there's, there's kind of a, at least for, I'll say these are Michael's

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.100
Mastodon's conventions.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.660
Uh, you, you could take them for what you want.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.780
I just made them up, but this is how I think about it.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.300
So people will follow me and I'm like, huh, did that person follow me?

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.340
Cause they listened to the show and listened to Brian say, you should come join us and have

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:33.900
a conversation.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.240
Hey, I'd like to follow that person.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.600
But a lot of times they have no picture, no description, no web pages, no posts.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.340
You're like, yeah, maybe not next, you know?

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:47.200
And so I'm just going to say, if you have a picture and a description, a description seems

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.740
somewhat relevant.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.260
I will certainly follow you back.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.120
If you have posts, that's plus one.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.420
If you have a verified webpage, which is easy, another plus one.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.680
And a lot of people have private accounts who follow me.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.580
I'm like, why are you in social media?

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.560
If you want a private account?

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.720
I don't understand what this is because your profile is public.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.640
Just your posts are private, but the platform has a way to have private posts.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.340
I don't understand.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.780
So anyway, probably not going to get a lot of engagement.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.980
If you have a private account, just post private messages for things you don't want to see.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.540
So, and while I'm on the topic of Mastodon, I had a really nice and productive conversation

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.860
with the PSF around my mask rant on PyCon.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.160
So that was nice over there.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.540
Some people weren't nice as they sent me, like not necessarily nice responses, but the PSF

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:29.720
did.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.240
And that was cool.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:30.920
That's nice.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.360
Yeah.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:31.800
All right.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.620
Next one.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.060
Oh, wait.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:38.160
Before you move on, I just want to add my two cents on the, the picture.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.440
Um, I also prefer to be able to see who it is, but also primarily if the picture is something

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.800
that they're using on other stuff.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.780
So like if a lot of people have a, their profile picture on their, like the profile picture on

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:56.940
their blog and on their, and in their primarily a GitHub user and, and they have the

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:02.160
same profile there, even if it's like a stylized something, but if it's the, if it's distinctive

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.900
and the same everywhere, like glyph, for instance, has a, has a different thing for them.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.700
I I'm okay with that, but most people I think go with their picture.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.740
I think it's the right answer.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.400
But yeah, when I say picture, I don't mean necessarily it has to be your picture.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.600
Just the fact that it's not the default icon.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.340
You've taken enough effort to put in something, even if it's just a picture of a triangle, I don't

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:23.540
care.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.080
You know?

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.440
Yeah.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.500
All right.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.500
Uh, Paul is asking in the audience, what is your secret?

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.620
Okay, well, we'll do this.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:39.660
Um, we, earlier on, we were talking about how Michael's got a faster internet now, so we

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.460
should make it really fast speed.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:47.380
Um, and then somebody commented, wagrants, wagrants, commented, I played it at one and a half

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:47.980
times speed.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.000
Then I got up to a live event.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.960
Uh, and all of a sudden Brian should sounded like he got drunk in one second.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.180
Um, and so I said, Brian's secret is out.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:21:59.980
So nice.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.900
I'll just have another drink of my, Irish coffee.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:03.960
It's coffee.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.960
Trust me.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.660
All right.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.080
Uh, more extras.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:15.320
So, Dropbox spooks users with turning on new AI features that can almost automatically

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.940
send your private documents to open AI.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.260
Now you have to interact with part of the site for it to happen, but it doesn't say, Hey,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.660
necessarily, cause you does, you touch this.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.600
We're now sending your social security number away.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.140
Um, but anyway, that's kind of unnerving.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:31.920
Yeah.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.100
Yeah.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:38.740
So you can check that out on defaulted to on if you're not subject to the GDPR, but defaulted

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.200
to off if you are.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.040
So, you know, plus one for GDPR there, I suppose.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.340
So mine was turned on.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:44.960
Okay.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.920
So you have to go check to make sure that they're not sharing all of your.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.120
Yes, exactly.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.520
And it's on by default for you, Brian.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.400
So you might want to check the whole conversation.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.160
It's on ours.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:00.660
The, the, the comment section of our second is like the top notch place for comments, I

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:00.880
think.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.960
So really good.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.840
Okay.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.360
Yeah.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.700
There's, it talks about how to go find it.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.680
So anyway, this like maybe think, you know what?

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.840
I should really be a little more.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.860
I have, I have like three terabytes of data and Dropbox.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.040
So I'm like, maybe I should be a little more specific and intentional about where I put

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.360
my stuff.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.980
So I went on this, this ran on Mastodon, by the way, a bunch of people sent me all sorts

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.620
of options of like, okay, if not Dropbox, then what?

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:25.900
And I decided whatever I'm doing is probably good to have it end to end encrypted.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.720
Cause then I don't care what they try to do with it.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:27.980
Right.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.220
Cause they can't decrypt it.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:29.420
Yeah.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.400
That, that solves a whole lot of problems.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.400
You care about the security, but it doesn't matter as much as if you're just exposing files

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.080
or leaking stuff or whatever.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.380
Right.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:43.200
So I decided to go, I already have a paid Proton account.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.160
So all my private stuff, all my private documents, like my scans of things I want to save that might

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:48.760
be sensitive.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.380
They're going to Proton drive.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:54.520
I have 500 gigs and it's already paid for and encrypted.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.260
There's async thing you can install.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.080
That's pretty excellent.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.120
I looked around and some people suggested next cloud, which is really interesting.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.500
It's maybe more than I want.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:07.480
It's almost like a document calendar, everything self-hosted.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.460
Maybe do that next.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.160
Yeah.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.120
Own cloud got like super owned just last week.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.960
And there's a similar self-hosted thing, which makes me a little nervous to self-host stuff.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.940
I know there are people who host it for you, but it's not next cloud.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.120
It's a little bit indirect.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.580
So maybe violin.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:29.180
I don't know if you've heard of this, but they have encrypted cloud storage and the end again,

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.160
pretty nice.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.180
I think this is British.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.660
I don't remember exactly.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.240
UG.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.000
Not sure.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.520
But somewhere in Europe, this company, it looks pretty good.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.020
I have not tried it, but in encrypted.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.580
There's IceDrive, the next generation cloud storage.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.380
Also, I think this might be the British one.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.460
Yeah, this is in Wales.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.360
I mean, British, I mean, UK.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:49.980
Sorry, folks.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.500
So that's pretty interesting.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.620
And I think I'm going to go with sync.com.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.540
Super simple.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.180
All they do is sync and then encrypted for six terabytes.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:05.340
It's like 140 bucks a year or something like that, which is a lot versus 240 for less than

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:05.880
that in Dropbox.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.660
Anyway, if people are in this zone of like, I'm looking for all this stuff.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.320
Oh my gosh.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.600
Like, what am I going to do?

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.740
Regardless of whether you care about the Dropbox fiasco.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.820
Here's a bunch of options people can pick.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.840
There was one comment in this whole discussion that was pretty interesting.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.100
I think it was in the Ars Technica thing.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.520
And it said, look, if you give your data unencrypted to somebody,

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.880
another company, even if you trust them, you don't really necessarily control that anymore,

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.600
especially if they decide to pass it along.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.740
So somebody pointed out Cryptometer.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.480
Have you heard of this, Brian?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.120
No.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.500
Cryptometer is cool.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.780
I have used something like it, but it's older and no longer supported, which makes me sad.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.180
So what you do is you run this app.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.260
It does like super strong encryption.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.840
You control the key, right?

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.940
It's just like a thing you make up and don't give away.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:55.600
And then it will create a drive, a mountable drive on your Mac or on Windows,

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.540
like a D drive or E drive or whatever.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.620
And that thing is encrypted.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.860
So when you mount it with this software, it looks like a drive.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.580
But then when you unmount it, it becomes just an encrypted pile of files.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:09.020
So you put that in Dropbox, you put that in sync or whatever.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.820
And then no matter what happens, they just get an encrypted blob of stuff.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.620
So things I super care about.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.900
I have encrypted in something, either Cryptometer or something like it,

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.480
on top of all the safety around the cloud drive and trust and whatever you might have there.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:28.060
Like worst case scenario, they get a huge, hard, hard to decrypt a blob of stuff that they don't know the value of.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.320
And I don't know if it has Linux.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.600
Someone's asking, does it have Linux?

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.820
I think it might.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.780
Let's see.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.680
Mac.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.880
Let's see if I go to download what it says.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.380
Yeah.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.820
Worth knowing for people.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:40.580
Downloads.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.300
Use your DMG.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.620
Yeah.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.200
Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS even.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.540
Yeah.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.720
So that's that.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.700
I think that it's a loss.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.840
I mean, cool.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:57.300
But Cryptomator would have been great as a rotten tomato sort of thing to rate different cryptocurrencies.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.620
I know.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.840
It's the word is taken.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.600
I'm pretty sure this has been around before crypto became a thing.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:12.440
Like, I'm not sure how old this is, but yeah, there's 17 pages of releases on GitHub from 2017.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.900
So yeah, they were ahead of their time in that.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.540
But yeah, this is super cool, Brian.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.320
Like you can just say, I don't really care that much about the security where these files go.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.340
You're not getting them.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.620
Interesting.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.880
So I suggest a sweet combination of these things.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.180
I'm going through like a super digital decluttering as part of this, and it's glorious.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.300
I'm having like a tech love affair with Notion.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:33.940
It's so good.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.440
But yeah, anyway, I'll leave it there.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.000
Maybe I'll come back and tell you more about this.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.520
Last thing for me, I'm doing the keynote at PyCon Philippines 2024 in February.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.420
How awesome is that?

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.460
Slightly jealous, man.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.720
Somewhere I scroll down and over.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.320
Woo.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:52.880
Yeah.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:53.340
Cool.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.320
Three of us, and I get to be one of them.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:55.900
So that'll be awesome.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.100
Thank you for inviting me.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.900
And if you're going to be there, I will see you there.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.460
Nice.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.440
Yeah, in February.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:00.980
Cool.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:01.860
Oops.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.740
Over to you for your extras.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.440
Well, I just deleted one.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.620
So sorry about that.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.560
But shift command T.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.000
Oh, shift commit.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:12.620
Whatever.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.420
I'll just tell you guys about it.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:22.580
So this is the kind of time of year that some people like to donate some money to different people.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.240
different groups.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.880
I had the link up for the Python Software Foundation.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.240
So Python Software Foundation is not hard to find.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.420
So I would encourage people to consider giving some money to the PSF.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.540
So Django Software Foundation is doing a drive.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.280
So giving some money.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.500
If you use Django, of course.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.880
If you enjoy Python Bytes, of course, you can check out Patreon.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:53.380
At Patreon, we do accept money for Python Bytes to help keep the show going.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.040
This is great.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:29:01.300
Also, I wanted to highlight as well just the idea that to just go on GitHub.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.580
So the different things you use on GitHub.

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.120
Like adders, for instance, you can go down and you can sponsor this project.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.900
You can throw some money that way.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.340
pytest has a sponsor link.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:22.300
Palettes and Flask has a way to sponsor either all of Palettes or particular projects within the Palettes program.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:30.280
And really, a lot of projects that you use every day have a sponsor of this project on GitHub.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.340
So I think it'd be great, too, for people.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.980
If you have extra and you want to help out, I think it's a good idea.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.640
Sometimes I help out different projects.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.900
And I kind of shift it up every year in local things.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.500
And I think the things that I use.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:50.700
And somebody asked me once recently about some projects don't really need the money.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:56.620
And I guess, for instance, I really love having people support Python Bytes through Patreon.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.560
It's fun to have our community help support us.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.040
If you, in particular, don't donate, we're not going to disappear.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.020
Michael and I are going to keep doing it anyway.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.860
It is totally up to you.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.600
And definitely don't do it if it's a hardship.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.120
But I think it's a fun thing to do this time of year is to spread the love around.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.200
That's all I wanted to say.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.140
Indeed, I second that as well.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.980
That's kind of serious, though.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.500
Do you have something funny for us?

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.560
Let's lighten it up.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.660
No, this is not funny.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.100
It's too close to home.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.540
You told me how you feel about this.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.360
So here's the joke.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.260
Here's the joke.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.760
So there's two red buttons.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.800
Think Ren and Stimpy or something like that.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.240
And a huge, scary red button.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.400
You can press either of them.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.640
One of them says, pay $12.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.700
The other one says, admit to yourself, your dream is dead.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.820
And at the bottom, there's somebody sweating trying to decide which button to press.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.440
And it's the domain renewal.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:49.740
Oh, yeah.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:49.780
Totally.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.380
Totally.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:58.340
This is way too close to home for me because I just transferred 25 domains from all the different

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.960
places into hovers I talked about like a while ago.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.600
And I talked about all the name servers and all that.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.700
And there was a few where I'm like, God, is the dream dead or do I just move this?

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.000
So how many are you using still out of those?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.900
Well, lots of them are to like protect people from doing crappy stuff.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.720
For example, I've talked by thon.com.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.420
I don't technically use it.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.220
It redirects to talk by thon.fm.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.200
But if I don't have it, someone will get it.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.580
And then all sorts of badness.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.060
Like there's a bunch of these guards.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.800
I would say half of them fall into that realm.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.300
Okay.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.960
And then maybe another third I'm directly using.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.980
And then there's the whatever the balance, the one sixth that's left is the dream could

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.360
be dead.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.220
But or it could be not there yet.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:38.900
Not realized yet.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.240
We'll see.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:44.020
I had about eight that I was not really using last year.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:51.160
And I admitted that about half of those are not going to go anywhere and let them expire.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.860
Although I mean, the domain companies don't make it easy.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.380
You're like, okay, I'm just going to let it expire.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:58.560
But you get like emails.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.200
No, it's going to go.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.260
Oh, it's gone.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.260
But we're going to save it for you for a couple more months.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.720
And you get a whole bunch of guilt emails.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.520
But yeah.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.260
Anyway.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:08.760
Yeah.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.560
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.660
I have one real quick sad story to round this out, Brian.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:16.520
A friend of mine and I decided we're going to write some iPhone apps right when the iPhone

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.060
came out, like 2007 or whatever it was.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.360
And he had the clever idea of like, let's go.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:21.940
Let's get a domain.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.980
I would probably do it together.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:23.420
I don't know.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.460
Got the domain.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.240
iPhone dot L Y.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:26.720
I fun.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:26.900
Lee.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.760
And we worked on stuff for like a year because we didn't know we're going to build.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.560
We'll just like come up with this.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.440
We'll put stuff there.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.020
Never really came up with stuff.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.520
It looked like there was nothing on the horizon.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.980
We're like, you know, after three years, the L Y is like the FM.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.020
I was like kind of expensive.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.100
Like, ah, just let it go.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.440
A week later, somebody says, Hey, I'll give you $5,000 for that domain.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.700
So I shoot my friend like, Hey, don't let it expire yet.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.840
Let's do this instead.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.280
He's like, it expired last week.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:48.920
Like, no.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.720
Oh no.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.780
Oh well.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.680
So it goes.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:57.600
So that somebody could have paid you $5,000, but they instead got it for like 20 or got it.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:57.820
Yeah.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.780
For like 20 bucks or something.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.120
I'm sorry to laugh at your pain.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.380
No, it's okay.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.900
I mean, like I'm telling you, this is not a joke.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.880
Admit to yourself, your dream is dead or pay $12 for the rest of your life every year.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.000
That's where you are.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.360
No, it's good.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.000
It's a good joke and people can hopefully laugh at it.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.420
Yeah.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.100
Everybody.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.500
Most people that listen to this podcast probably are feeling this.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.160
Yeah.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:22.580
All right.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:22.980
All right.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.900
Well, I'm feeling good about our year's worth of show every day.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:26.800
Yeah.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.700
365.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.700
Pretty cool.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:29.040
Yeah.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:29.780
All right.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.520
Talk to you later.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:30.980
Yeah.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.380
See you.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:32.080
