00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.980
Do you like to play games or solve puzzles?

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.780
Chances are pretty good that you do.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.300
After all, what is programming and software development but one really elaborate puzzle?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.960
On this episode of Talk Python to Me, you'll meet someone who has pushed this idea of programming

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.060
as a game to its logical conclusion.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.360
Alexander Leibach is the creator of Check.io and Empire of Code.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.000
Check.io is a programming adventure game where you solve puzzles and share them with fellow

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.380
players.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.720
Empire of Code is a tower defense game where part of the strategy is to actually program

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.160
the AI in Python.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.100
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 75, recorded September 8th, 2016.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:07.640
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.160
ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.300
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.300

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.760
This episode is brought to you by Hired and SnapCI.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.140
Thank them for supporting the show on Twitter via at Hired underscore HQ and at Snap underscore

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.540
CI.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.080
Hey, everyone.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.680
Thanks for listening as always.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.580
Before we get to the interview with Alex, I want to give you a heads up on something I've

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.740
created just for you listeners.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.580
Near the end of this episode, I speak with Alex about the class management and group management

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.860
features in the game in Check.io.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.240
So I've decided to create a class that consists of all podcast listeners.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.940
If you want to group up with your fellow listeners and do some of these puzzles, you can use the

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.960
following link to join up and share your updates and solutions.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.920
Just go to py.checkio.org slash group slash talk dash python dash listeners, create an account or log in, and then say you want to join the class.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.580
You can, of course, find that link in the show notes as well.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.300
If you're a teacher yourself, keep an ear open to the end of the show about how you can do this for your own classes, whether that's university, high

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.500
school or middle school courses.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.080
Now, let's talk to Alex.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.500
Alex, welcome to the show.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.040
Hi.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.620
It's great to be here and a big honor for me.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.900
Thank you.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.760
Oh, it's my honor to have you.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.700
I really appreciate you coming here.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.900
We are going to talk about programming and games and some really interesting stuff that you guys have built over at checkio.org.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.700
Yeah, I love to talk about it.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.340
I bet that's your baby, right?

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.320
Okay.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.100
So before we get to talking about that, let's hear your story.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.440
How did you get into programming and Python?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.420
Yeah, that was a long time ago, the high school.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.240
So I remember before that I was using my father's computer only for games.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.120
So I was a big gamer.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.680
But at that time, my friends come in and show me his first code.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.760
It was Pascal.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.640
And I was so much amazed how easy it is.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.180
How, what are cool things I can do by coding.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.060
And I started taking coding class with him.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.120
So, yes, it was the Pascal a long time ago.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.620
And then later on in my university, it was Delphi, then PHP, Perl, and then Python.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.320
And I stayed with Python for a long time already.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.080
I love it.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.800
Yeah, Python's really nice.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.800
It definitely has some improvements on those other languages that you mentioned.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.780
But also the community is so excellent, right?

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.820
It's really fun to work with the people who like Python, not just the technology.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.420
Yeah.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.700
I remember myself starting actually the Python.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:00.480
So when I was, my first programming job actually was Perl developer in a bank.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.000
So, and when the first time I saw Python's piece of code, I was amazed how beautiful it is.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.640
Is it actually a really code?

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.500
Like, it can be a poem or like a song, but it's not a code.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.140
Because like before I was coding Perl for four years.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.340
And it was so beautiful.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.300
I was so amazed at that time.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:33.360
So I started doing some, start learning Python after work and eventually quit my job and start doing Python freelancing.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.020
That's cool.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.780
And was that like web development or what kind of apps were you building?

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.200
Web development, yeah.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.880
Python, Django.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.940
Okay, with Django.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.260
Yeah.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.560
Uh-huh.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.320
Nice.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.620
I remember Django when it was, remember new forms, like with this transaction.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.880
Still my favorite framework.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.800
You've moved on to building something that is actually a pretty incredible web app.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.140
I must say a couple of incredible web apps, I guess.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.800
And a whole interesting world here that brings all the stuff that you talked about, more or less,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.360
together at Check.io.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.820
Tell us what is Check.io.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.340
Back to the time when I just started learning Python.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:25.260
I think the first line of code was written during my first year of learning Python.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.040
So at the time, as I said, I was so much amazed how beautiful Python is.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.080
And I thought it should be a gallery.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.580
It should be a gallery of different Python solutions since it's so beautiful.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.200
And if I create a new solution, I should share it somehow.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.200
I should show it.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:51.720
And I should go through all other solutions and see how everybody else solved this particular puzzle.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.660
So this is why I created Check.io.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.560
And later on, I have more people join the team.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.000
But yeah, the first version of Check.io wasn't that beautiful.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.100
But the core idea is still from the very beginning to the version that we have right now,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.900
is that you should solve the puzzle.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.060
And you can share a solution if you want.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.760
But after you solve the puzzle, you can see a solution of other users.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.060
You can discuss their solution.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.580
There are several categories for the solution, like clear code, creative code, speedy code.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:39.720
And I love this feeling, you know, when you're spending like five hours in a row

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.260
trying to figure out how to solve this mission, this puzzle.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:50.540
And later on, when you solve it, and maybe even you share your solution,

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.680
and then get into solution of other users, and you're like amazed.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.360
Oh my God, it's possible to solve in two lines?

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.140
I can't believe.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.520
And why I didn't figure out this later?

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.740
And I think this is the perfect learning curve.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.320
Like when you're trying to figure out it by yourself,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.880
then see how some other users solved it.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.460
And again and again, I think,

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.200
so I know a lot of people who become a Python developers,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.900
very good Python developers through the checker in that way.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.940
Yeah, it's really cool.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:27.420
So maybe I should just try to give like a visual description of the experience.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.720
Yeah.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.720
So you come in, you create an account,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.860
and then you land in this world of floating islands.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.600
And it has this very 3D feel with animations and stuff,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.800
even though it's in a flat web page.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.740
You know, it doesn't, it's not like a Flash game.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.440
It's HTML5 or something like this, yeah?

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:44.960
Yeah.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.300
Yeah, with Canvas and whatnot.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.660
Cool.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.840
And so you have these worlds,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.640
and each world represents a set of similar programming puzzles.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.560
Did you ever play the game Myst,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.720
M-Y-S-T?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.080
One of these super beautiful but puzzle-oriented games.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.120
And it feels like a little bit like that for code.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.920
Like you go to these different parts of the world,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.680
and you go in,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.780
and you get these different puzzles, right?

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.660
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.180
By solving those puzzles on each island,

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.860
eventually you can get more island open around this island,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.000
and you can explore more and more island around.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.700
Yeah, it's quite neat.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.480
I think, you know, you go into these puzzles,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.720
and I guess there's probably 5 to 20 puzzles per little island.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.460
And you go in there,

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.920
and they're ranked in levels of difficulty and categories.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.540
So some are like data structures,

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.660
and some are finding bugs or things like that, right?

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.260
And you also have a difficulty level.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.540
Actually, all the time we're trying to experiment

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.760
with different kind of puzzles.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.920
So in some part of Checker world,

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.780
you can find like a machine, like you said.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.420
You just need to fix the bug on the solution,

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.220
so we actually give you a solution.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.720
It's almost working.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.060
There are some, but some,

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.100
there are some tests that doesn't work.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.120
So your mission here to fix those bugs.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.960
There are some other missions

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.740
that you actually don't share your solution,

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.580
but you can get more points for these solutions,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.700
depends on the rules.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.940
So for instance, we can ask you,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.780
try to solve this puzzle in a short way possible.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.920
So your solution should be as short as possible.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.320
I call that coding golf puzzles.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.880
And after you solve,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.680
you can see how short solution of other users.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.040
And you think, oh my God,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.660
I think it's,

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.420
I'm like spending all night and get 50 symbols,

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.120
and someone find out how to make it in 12.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.420
I can't believe in.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.140
Yeah, it's really amazing.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.320
And like you said,

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:53.700
you can,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.800
you basically,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.300
you write the solution

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.620
and it's,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.860
it's run by the system.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.880
And we could talk about how you write your solution

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.540
and all that in a moment.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.400
but you write some Python code

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.480
that solves the problem under the conditions,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.300
the inputs and outputs that you're supposed to,

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.720
which usually they're pretty self-contained.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.680
It's not too elaborate.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:12.980
So,

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.760
but they are kind of tricky in some interesting way.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.860
And then once you're done,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.780
you can categorize your solution.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.780
If you want to share it,

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.780
if you want to publish it,

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.840
as like you said,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.360
like really concise,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.860
really efficient,

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.760
you can just leave it and say,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.540
I don't have no idea what you would call this,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.120
but it works,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.260
things like that.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.560
And it reminds me,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:33.960
you know,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.340
you can go through the solutions

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.820
and you can see other people's solutions.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.120
And my feeling is,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.440
it's a little bit like the Mark Twain quote

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.060
that says,

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.160
I'm sorry I wrote you a long letter.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.080
I didn't have time to write you a short one.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.740
You know,

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:45.940
that,

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.620
that kind of thing.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:46.880
Like,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.780
like I go through and I solve it.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:49.980
I'm like,

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.340
oh yeah,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:50.680
this is,

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.780
this will totally do it.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.020
And then you just flip the next line

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.700
and it's like,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.240
filter this,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.080
did it at one line.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:56.420
You're like,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:56.800
whoa.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.820
Okay.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:59.960
It also,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.360
I think it's really interesting

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:01.880
in that it,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.940
it sort of touches on this concept

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.300
of Pythonic code

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.780
by looking at the solutions,

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.080
right?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.540
Yeah.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.460
So in the new Python release,

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.400
we are trying to test this new idea.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.880
So we actually put,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.740
so mission has three stages.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.320
So in the first stage,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.680
it's the collecting modes.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.620
If you see some of others,

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.380
you should share your solution first.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.080
No matter what.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.040
So let's,

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.260
we're looking for collecting mode.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.120
Then,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.920
so viewing mode.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.920
So you might not share your solution,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.600
but you should definitely solve this,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.240
no matter what.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.600
And then you can go and see leaderboard

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.000
of other user solution,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.180
review their solution,

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.060
and so on and so on.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.720
So usually what we see right now.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.020
that we may be some other

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.400
checker users,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.340
we are trying to figure out,

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.940
out of all the solutions,

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.260
we pick some solutions

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.580
that we think are the most different.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.080
It might be not that,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.860
it might be not as perfect

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.740
as it should be,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.660
but they are definitely unique

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.380
in the whole specter of solutions.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:08.620
Okay,

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.200
that's interesting.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.560
So you try to provide like

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.500
a variety of answers to people?

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:12.900
Yes,

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:13.300
yes,

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:13.800
yes.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.680
So you,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.780
all the time you see,

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.000
when you check editor's solutions,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.740
you see only different

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.180
and only unique solutions

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.720
that we find in checker.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.440
So this is the third stage

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.120
of each mission.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.080
It is really interesting.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.700
So I learned a lot

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.360
when I solved some of the problems

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.700
and published it.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.700
And I realized

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.680
that there were biases

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.260
in the solutions I was creating.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.040
And I didn't,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.260
I didn't realize they were biases.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.380
Like for example,

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.640
on one of them

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.480
that I was working on,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.680
I was trying to do stuff

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.420
what I felt like

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.820
was the most efficient way,

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.780
not in lines of code,

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.420
but what I thought

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:50.820
would be like

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.020
the most efficient algorithm

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.160
for like maybe large data sets

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.500
or whatever.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.520
And that resulted in,

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:56.920
I don't know,

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.140
maybe eight lines of code.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.360
And then other people

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.080
were doing the answers

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.440
with like a list comprehension

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.340
in one line.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:02.800
But I'm like,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.100
oh,

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.560
but that's going to be way slower.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.760
But,

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.020
you know,

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.800
I guess it depends

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.240
on what you're aiming for,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.440
right?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.200
Like if you're aiming

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.460
for super readable

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.600
and you know you're not working

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:11.940
with,

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.480
you know,

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.220
100,000 lines of data elements,

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.540
you're working with 500,

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.000
then,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.280
you know,

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.180
probably that solution

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:18.880
is way better.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.160
And so it just,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.580
I thought it was interesting

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.600
that it brought out

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.040
little biases

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:24.700
that I had

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.500
in ways of approaching problems

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.500
that I didn't,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.640
it's not like I started out

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:28.860
to say,

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.000
oh,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.100
this will be way more efficient

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:30.900
if I do it this way.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.820
So let me try this.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.100
It's just,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:32.840
that's the way I started

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.520
writing the code.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.300
So that was really interesting.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:35.720
Yeah,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.780
this is why we created

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.560
Couchverse

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.680
for this session.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.620
Depends on your,

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.640
what is your aim

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.120
to,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.780
what was your goal

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.440
while you created this solution.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.520
Some of the people

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.420
just love to create

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.500
crazy solutions,

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.920
like one-liners

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.020
or just

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.540
try to make it

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.960
as confusing

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.840
as possible,

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.320
I would say.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:55.960
So we have

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.800
one,

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.460
one of the most famous

00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.620
user on check,

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.300
Vicky.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.980
And I want just to say

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:03.880
hi to him

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.420
if he,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.520
I'm sure he's listening

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.160
to this podcast.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.740
So he has the most

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.120
biggest amount

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.820
of followers

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.700
in the game

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.380
and he is,

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.580
he'll love to create

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.880
the most crazy solutions.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.760
So I think

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.140
the creative category

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:18.760
we created

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.780
just specifically

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.520
for Vicky.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.800
And yeah,

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.960
for those unique people

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.120
who love to create

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.400
some unique solution

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.420
or create a creative

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.440
and they're

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.700
competing with each other

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.040
in creativity.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.020
Yeah.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:32.480
Yeah.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.240
Yeah,

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:33.580
that's,

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.040
yeah,

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.760
I think it really

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.660
does bring out

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.340
a lot of,

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.340
a lot of interesting stuff.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.100
Would you say,

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.680
it seems to me like,

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.540
tell me if I have

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.000
the right sort of feeling.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.140
I did start at the beginning

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.260
so I kind of feel like

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.400
I can at least guess at this.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.440
That Check.io

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.320
is really good

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.440
for people that know

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.780
something about

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.340
programming

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.080
but in order

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.900
to do it,

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.860
you kind of need

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.060
to know a little bit,

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.120
a little,

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.740
almost a little tiny bit

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.040
of Python rules,

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.520
right?

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.800
Like how to define

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.960
code blocks

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.540
or suites

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.300
and how to perform

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.760
conditionals.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.400
And so it's,

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.180
it's not like

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.860
I'm bored

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.520
with my job

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.080
in finance

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.040
and I've never touched

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.220
a line of code

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.400
but I want to come learn it.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.100
You've got to be

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.940
a little bit

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.080
into programming.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:19.840
Yes.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.560
I do have this question

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:21.940
a lot,

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.400
why we are not

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.160
teaching Python

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.480
and I do have

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.280
a lot of questions

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:26.880
like this.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.480
Well,

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.480
you are teaching Python,

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.580
you're just not teaching

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.180
zero to like

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.500
the very first step.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.980
this is what I love.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.320
Yeah,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:34.580
yeah.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.300
So we are not teaching

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.100
like you said,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.080
we are not teaching

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.680
from zero

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.460
to some point.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.920
So I do believe

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.200
that in internet

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.060
out there,

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.320
there are so many

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:44.860
places

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.000
where you can learn

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.780
how to code

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.700
but there are

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.800
so few places

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.700
where you can

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.500
actually learn

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.460
how to create,

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.080
how to produce

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.580
code with a good

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.140
quality

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.660
and yeah,

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.340
and I believe

00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.040
that Checo

00:15:59.040 --> 00:15:59.820
is one of those

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.240
places.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.920
So this is

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.620
our goal

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.800
to not maybe

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.700
to teach you

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.440
how to code

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.680
but teach you

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.360
how to create

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.300
a good coding

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:08.920
solutions.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.460
Yeah,

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.100
I think that

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.120
that's correct.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.680
You're right,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.360
there are so many

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.340
places to learn

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.460
to code these days

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.840
if you're kind

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.720
of like a career

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.200
switcher.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.240
I kind of think

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.000
of people as

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.720
they're like,

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.320
I know that I want

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:22.940
to get into programming,

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.460
I have no idea

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.000
what that means,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.440
like that level

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.340
that you probably

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:26.800
got to start

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.280
somewhere else

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.680
but I heard

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.700
someone say,

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.740
one of my listeners

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.900
suggested that I

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.700
reach out to you

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.780
again and we get

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.620
this show put together

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.180
and I,

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:35.540
sorry,

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:35.900
I don't remember

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.260
who it was

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:36.780
but thanks for

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.840
contacting me

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.120
on Twitter

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.320
and they said,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:39.640
look,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.300
you guys really

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.180
have it right,

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:41.820
you have it

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.340
so that you want

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.380
to just keep learning

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.100
and you want to

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.600
make learning

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.520
to code addictive

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.340
and fun

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:47.860
and I think

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.120
that's a way

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.200
more important service

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.800
than teaching people

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.940
what a variable is

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.480
or what a string is

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:55.960
or,

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.440
you know,

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:56.960
what an if,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.580
the concept of an if statement

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.220
for example.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:16:59.680
Yeah,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.700
this is actually

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.740
one of the reasons

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.940
why a lot of teachers

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.800
and in a lot of university,

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.740
teachers recommend us

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.940
as an additional way

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.740
to learn coding

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.360
so because we don't

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.320
provide any learning materials

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.680
or something like that,

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.060
we probably,

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.460
we don't have any conflicts

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.880
with what they are teaching,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.700
we just give them

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.420
an additional way

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.020
to learn.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.760
So if you are,

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.160
right now,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.160
if you are learning

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.160
how to code

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.880
and even from zero,

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.200
you should definitely

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.080
start practicing

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.020
right from the very first day

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.400
and you should learn,

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.420
you should find

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.600
some places to do it

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.140
and Check.io,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.740
I think it's the perfect place

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.180
to do it.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:42.600
Yeah,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.640
it's definitely

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.500
a good place to start

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.240
because often

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.840
people start wanting to code

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.440
because they've got

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.420
some grand idea

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.220
but the grand idea is,

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.920
it can be so overwhelming

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.880
because you don't even

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.620
know where to start

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.380
but Check.io,

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.580
the missions are

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.040
sufficiently self-contained

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.440
that it doesn't feel like,

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:58.640
oh,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.340
there's no way

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.040
I can get,

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.020
like where do I even start,

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:01.240
right?

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.660
You can get started

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.380
and it's pretty structured

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.260
so I think it is

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.140
a great place to learn.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.540
Let's talk about

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.420
the experience

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.580
of doing the exercises.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.580
Okay.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.380
I go to my little island

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.280
which like I said

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:13.860
is beautiful,

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.900
it's got little clouds

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.340
and stuff

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.140
and I pick my challenge,

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.480
my puzzle

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.900
and then it takes me

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.160
to an online editor,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:21.480
right?

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.480
We have online editor

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.420
and actually

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.020
at the same time

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.120
with online editor

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:27.940
we also have

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:28.980
web plugins

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.220
and with those

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.340
web plugins

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.500
that you can install

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.780
in your Chrome browser

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.260
Firefox,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.880
you can use

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.720
your local editor

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.080
actually.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.140
So you don't need

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.700
to actually,

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.120
if you start doing

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.480
some big solution

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.740
or working on

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.420
a big problem

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:45.960
on Check.io,

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.940
you most of the time

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.220
use your local editor.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.580
So we give you

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.280
this opportunity

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.000
to use your local editor

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.340
and then you just

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.240
open the Check.io

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.660
and you see your code

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.180
right from your local editor

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.580
in our web editor.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.360
Oh, okay.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.680
That's awesome.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.720
So like if I'm using

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.460
PyCharm or Sublime Text

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.320
or something like that,

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.760
I can just sort of

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.900
download it

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.340
and somehow

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.360
the web plugin

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.720
keeps my local version

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.940
and my Check.io version

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.240
in sync?

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.500
Yes, yes, yes.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.080
We're synchronized

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.340
of both of those solutions.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.980
So right after you

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:19.880
make some changes

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.580
in our web version

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.280
of Check.io,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.140
this goes to your local editor

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:25.800
there as well.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.520
So it's very easy

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.080
for you to solve

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.640
and actually,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.760
since you mentioned

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.560
PyCharm,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.040
we also

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.540
partnering with

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.480
PyCharm

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.180
and also

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.680
and the whole partnership

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.580
starts with

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.760
PyCharm Education.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.880
So we have this

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.420
PyCharm has

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.440
a plugin

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.080
for PyCharm Education

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.600
and using those plugins

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.600
you actually can

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.100
solve puzzle

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.620
actually by using

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.160
PyCharm.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.620
so the whole Check.io interface,

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.180
those mission description,

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.800
the island structure,

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.160
animation,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.100
and it all goes

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.160
to write

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.560
in your PyCharm editor

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.160
and you can solve

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.880
coding puzzles

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.720
right from there.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.160
Oh, that's pretty interesting.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.560
So I didn't realize

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.600
that you guys integrated

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.480
with PyCharm Education Edition.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.940
So people have heard me

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.480
go on and on

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.640
about how I like PyCharm

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.240
as like a proper editor,

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:19.840
but they have

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.080
an alternate version

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.240
for education

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.140
that has these

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:24.780
like lessons

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.440
built into it

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:25.920
and so you guys

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.400
have integrated

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.140
with those lessons

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:27.720
in some way?

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.140
Yeah.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.720
They have this ability

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.800
to create plugins

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.480
for the PyCharm Education

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.600
and right when I

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.280
figured out

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.540
that PyCharm,

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.460
my favorite editor,

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.540
created the

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.980
educational version

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.300
and I was,

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.440
it is so crazy.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.780
I should find a way

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.740
to be part of this

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.520
and yeah,

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.720
I contact with them,

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.620
we start doing

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.380
those plugins

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.400
and eventually,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:51.840
yes,

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.180
the plugin was released

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.500
and we're both happy.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.560
That's nice.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.180
I'm going to have to

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:57.880
check that out now.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.060
So yeah,

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.380
and one more unique idea

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.940
for Checker Editor

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.640
that we are using

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.720
and the user love it

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.280
is that

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.000
for some of the mission,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.440
we create this

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.060
try it panel.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.240
So let me tell you

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.020
the idea.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.400
so we wanted

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.220
to present

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.320
the solution

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.040
you are trying

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:18.640
to solve

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.680
with some interface.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.920
So we create

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.480
for almost each

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.820
coding puzzle,

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.480
we create some interface.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.720
For instance,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.480
if you need to

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.820
find all the unique

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.380
symbols

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.700
in a piece of text,

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.040
right,

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.600
we give you

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.140
this text input

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.140
and you can put

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.520
your text in this input

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.080
and then click

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.540
tests

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.380
and it gives you

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.400
the result,

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.420
what symbols

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.100
were unique

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.000
in this particular text

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.100
and in order

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.140
to get the result,

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.380
those interface

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.180
actually using

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.320
your code,

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.280
the code that you

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.680
have written

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.560
in the editor.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.860
And for instance,

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.960
one other mission

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.300
that's one of my favorite

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.100
is Open Labyrinth

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.860
and there you have

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:05.840
actually the whole

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.400
labyrinth

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.040
created

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.640
and the

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.820
idea

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.840
for puzzle

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.360
is

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.460
to find

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.140
a way

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:13.740
to get

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.660
out of the

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.160
labyrinth.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.000
And in this interface,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.100
you can create

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.240
your own labyrinths.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.500
After clicking

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.020
solve,

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.060
you see how

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.080
some

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.100
arrow,

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:24.800
small,

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.640
tiny arrow,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.040
trying to get,

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.380
find a way

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.160
out of the

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:29.700
labyrinth

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.300
by using

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:30.720
actually

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.700
the program

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.720
that you created.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.800
So,

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.020
in such a way,

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:35.860
we're trying

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.480
to show you

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.700
that every

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.660
piece of code

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.360
has

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.780
an interface

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.820
that's probably

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:42.540
going to use

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.280
your code.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.440
It's not just

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.680
this boring

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.780
function

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.080
or boring piece of code.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.780
Take these numbers

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.620
or turn those numbers,

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.620
but something more

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.800
advanced, huh?

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.260
Yes, yes.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:23:05.760
This portion

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.400
of Talk Python

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.000
is brought to you

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.600
by Hired.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.600
Hired is the

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.280
platform for

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:09.900
top Python

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.640
developer jobs.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.540
Create your profile

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.100
and instantly

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:12.640
get access

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.380
to 3,500

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:13.880
companies

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.480
who will work

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:14.900
to compete

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.440
with you.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.200
Take it from

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:16.740
one of Hired's

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.180
users who

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:17.740
recently got a

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.300
job and said,

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:18.960
I had my

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.540
first offer

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.080
on Thursday

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.800
after going

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.580
live on Monday

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.200
and I ended

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:22.520
up getting

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.200
eight offers

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.600
in total.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.440
I've worked

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.040
with recruiters

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:25.520
in the past,

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:25.840
but they've

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.280
always been

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:26.840
pretty hit and

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.060
miss.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.720
I tried

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.000
LinkedIn,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.920
but I found

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.460
Hired to be

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:29.900
the best.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.900
I really like

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.340
knowing the

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.000
salary up front.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Privacy was

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:33.760
also a huge

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.360
seller for me.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.600
Sounds awesome,

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.040
doesn't it?

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:36.720
Well, wait

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.200
until you hear

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:37.520
about the

to me and

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:47.940
Hired will double

to $2,000.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:50.900
Opportunity's

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.160
knocking.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.740
Visit Hired.com

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.660
slash Talk Python

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:54.280
to me and

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:54.720
answer the

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:54.940
door.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:24:02.180
So the

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:02.800
editor is

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.500
really cool,

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.080
and the fact

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.340
that you

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:04.780
integrate with

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.260
the local

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.040
editors, I

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:06.560
think, is

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.220
even better.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.500
And I

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.000
noticed that

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.500
at the top

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:09.940
it says you

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:10.620
can import

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.420
some modules

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.200
or create

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.500
additional

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.620
functions or

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.240
things like

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:14.640
that, or

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.360
classes or

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:15.600
whatever.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:16.880
Yeah, we

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.480
have a set

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.620
of modules

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.440
that we

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:19.980
allow you

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.660
to import.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.380
Yeah, that's

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:21.600
what I was

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.000
going to ask.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.400
Like, surely

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.140
pretty much the

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.100
standard library

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:25.680
for the most

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.480
part, but then

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.040
are there

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.180
external open

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:28.620
source ones

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.040
as well?

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:29.800
A lot of

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.800
users ask

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.440
to add

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.180
SciPy.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.240
Sure, some

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:33.700
of the machine

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.240
learning stuff

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:34.740
maybe, yeah.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.700
And NumPy.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.300
So we

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.380
integrated all

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:38.780
of those

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.600
modules for

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.220
them, and

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:40.900
even for

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:41.840
Python version.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.900
For Python,

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.840
we created

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.520
the specific

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.360
category for

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:45.640
those

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.140
solution.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.040
We call

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.500
it third

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:47.760
party

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.280
solution.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.780
And if

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.180
you are

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.300
using those

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:51.780
kind of

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.160
modules, we

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.840
encourage you

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.980
to share

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:55.740
your solution

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.360
in those

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:56.900
categories.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.400
So for

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.040
those categories,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:24:59.860
you can

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:00.080
check

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.320
solutions that

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:01.880
are using

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.220
those

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:02.560
modules.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.260
Oh, that's

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:03.620
really cool.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.740
Now, another

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.180
thing that I

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:05.780
see up at

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.280
the top that

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.180
makes me

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.500
smile is

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.620
in this

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.340
editor, and

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.900
if you've

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.280
ever used

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:12.740
something like

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.140
JS

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:13.800
Fiddle, it's

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.180
a little bit

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:14.720
like that with

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.040
multiple

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.640
panes and

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.120
so on, if

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:16.460
you haven't

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:16.880
checked it

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.700
out, is it

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.560
has sort of

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.260
navigation, and

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:19.600
one of the

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.160
dropdowns at

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:20.800
the top is

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.700
it says I

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.260
can pick my

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.060
Python version,

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.220
and I

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:24.600
could pick

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.520
Python 2.7,

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.280
but the one

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:26.680
that I have

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.200
active is

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:27.940
actually Python

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.280
3.6

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.140
alpha 3,

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.820
or A3.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.880
That's pretty

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.500
awesome that you

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:34.820
guys are

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.760
running such a

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.500
new version of

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.260
Python 3.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.080
Yeah, we

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:39.680
are trying to

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.580
keep Python

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.620
version as

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.180
fresh as

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.320
possible, so

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.000
users of

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.040
Check.io can

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.880
play with the

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.320
freshest Python

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.520
version as

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.700
early as

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.820
possible, and

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.780
show some

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.560
awesome solutions

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.380
with new

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.040
cool Python

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:58.860
features that

00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:59.540
are coming out

00:25:59.540 --> 00:25:59.880
soon.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.580
So yeah.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.760
Yeah, that's

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.140
really cool.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:02.960
So if you want

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.520
to say, look,

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:03.940
I'm going to

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:04.740
demonstrate how

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.400
much easier this

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:05.960
problem is to

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.340
solve in

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.160
Python 3.6

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:07.700
than it was

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.600
in 3.4 or

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:09.800
something.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.300
You can do

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:10.680
that, right?

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.160
Yeah.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.740
Yeah.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.220
Yeah.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.020
How awesome.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:13.500
Okay.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.400
That's really

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:14.700
cool.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.320
Thank you.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.000
Yeah, you bet.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.280
So once I get

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:17.980
my solution and

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:18.600
I write it,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.700
and I can play

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.080
around with it,

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.120
my console or

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:22.880
my local editor,

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.700
I mean the

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.980
online terminal

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.300
console, or my

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.720
local editor, and

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.740
then once it

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.660
passes, it gives

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.220
me a couple of

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.280
options, right?

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.140
I can basically

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.440
just save it, or

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.380
I can publish

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.000
it and share

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.320
it with the

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:36.780
world, right?

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.640
As I said,

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.560
this is what

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.460
the first, very

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.420
first idea of

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:40.880
checkout, the

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.820
core idea of

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:42.940
sharing code

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:43.660
solution with

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.400
other users.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.680
So this is

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.900
where you can

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.440
share your

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.220
code, pick a

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.340
category, in

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:49.960
which category

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.740
actually you want

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.320
to share your

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:51.660
code.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.120
It can be a

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.460
clear solution if

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.260
you think this

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.020
is the code the

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:56.980
most appropriate

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.200
for actually

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.400
production code.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.800
This can be

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.440
creative solution

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.700
like one

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.680
liner, some

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.000
crazy ideas, some

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.020
funny solutions.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.220
It can be

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.020
speedy when

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.000
you're focusing,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.100
so no matter

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.340
how clear it

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.520
is, I only

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.540
want to create

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.600
the solution as

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.440
fast as possible,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.560
and as I

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.080
mentioned, just

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.400
earlier, third-party

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.200
solution when you're

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.260
just using some

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.100
additional modules,

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.240
and we also have

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.620
uncategorized.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.300
When you're not

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.200
sure which category

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:31.680
you want to

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.600
share, you just

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.160
want to share

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.820
this solution.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.260
Maybe later on

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:35.860
you want to share

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.640
with your friends

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.640
as well, so we

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.700
create this category

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.580
for you as well.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.580
So, yes.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.120
And after you

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.360
share, or maybe

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.180
after you solve,

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.260
you can get into

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.660
solution of other

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.020
users.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:48.940
This is actually

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:49.800
where all the

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.580
magic happens.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.540
You actually can

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.640
see solution of

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.540
others, upvote,

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.940
downvote solutions,

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.280
you can make code

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.080
reviews, and

00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.880
sometimes we

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.600
have so crazy

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.400
code reviews,

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.440
very details,

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.280
like every line,

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.060
why it's good,

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:06.960
why it's bad,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.800
and, yeah,

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.620
very educational

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.660
part of Checker

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.660
is actually inside

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.180
of these solutions

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:13.980
sharing.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.560
And you can

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.220
actually follow

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:16.740
some of the

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.760
people, some of

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.320
the people on

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.400
Checker, and

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.160
you can filter

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.680
all the solution

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.900
by only people

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.420
you follow.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.020
So it's easy

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.260
for you to find

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.100
your favorite

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:27.640
solution.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.400
Yeah, that's

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:28.600
cool.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.080
Like, you've

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:29.540
got, like, an

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.360
activity, sort

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.580
of stream of

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.020
activity on

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:34.660
there, and it'll

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.380
show you, like,

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.300
this is the

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:36.920
activity around

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.360
the various

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:37.980
puzzles you've

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.740
solved, or you

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:39.500
can follow people

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.200
and things like

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:40.640
that, right?

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.300
One of the

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.200
earliest features

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.800
as well, somehow

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.320
it become

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.740
naturally, like,

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.440
if I very

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.160
love what some

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:49.940
of the user is

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.460
doing, I want

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.220
to follow him,

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.020
I want to know

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.720
first what other

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.880
solution this guy

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.280
have made, and

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.300
what code

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.360
reviews he's

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.020
doing, which

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.900
solution he'll

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:01.680
like and don't

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:01.940
like.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.300
And that's why we

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:03.960
created this

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.960
activity, so you

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.200
can follow your

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.420
friends, maybe your

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.540
classmates, maybe

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.220
your teacher,

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.840
actually, or maybe

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.480
just a random

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.120
guy who's just

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.760
using, like,

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.140
Becky.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.400
Yeah, that's

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:16.560
cool.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.980
So if I'm, like, so

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:18.600
the other thing I

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.180
can do once I

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:19.900
publish it is I

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.660
can start cycling

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.600
through similar

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.860
solutions that are

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.560
either similar or

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.260
different than mine,

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.000
and maybe I find one

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.800
that's like, oh, that

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.840
is so much more

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.640
clever than what I

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.000
had done.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.500
Maybe you could

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.260
follow that person

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:30.860
and just see what

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:31.280
they're up to,

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:31.500
right?

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.660
Yeah.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.140
We actually, in

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.440
activity line, we

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.720
actually can propose

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.480
you some of the

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.440
users to follow.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.460
Depends on maybe

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.180
you have some

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.660
intersection with

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.180
this user during

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.620
the game, like,

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.340
you like his

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.660
solution a lot, or

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.560
you, this person

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.380
actually give you

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.420
some code reviews

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.260
or whatever, some,

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.540
any kind of

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.060
intersection.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.840
So when you next

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.400
time get into your

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.640
activity feed, we

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.360
can propose you.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.080
Maybe you want to

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.180
follow this guy since

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.100
you have so many

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.620
common interests.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.440
So, yeah.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.140
Yeah.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:06.500
Yeah.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:06.680
Yeah.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.160
Very cool.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.540
You also have

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.520
levels, like,

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.360
um, reminds me of

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.200
playing the MUDs

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:12.900
way back when,

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.740
level 1 to 20, and

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.640
there's just a few

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.340
people that are 20.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:16.820
That's cool.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.140
Switch gears from

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.120
the CheckIO puzzle

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.760
story for just a

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.140
moment.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.620
The other thing that

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.900
you can do, in

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:25.620
addition to solving

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.480
these puzzles in

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.440
this mist-like,

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.740
sort of, visit the

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.420
island style, is

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.380
there's more of a

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.200
tower defense,

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.140
World of Warcraft

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.220
type of game that

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:34.940
you've also created

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.620
that has to do with

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:35.820
code.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.260
Why don't you tell

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:36.940
people about that?

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.180
So about a year

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.020
ago, maybe more,

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.960
we created one more

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.220
game, Empire of

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:42.500
Code.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.460
So the idea of

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.420
this game was what

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.260
can happen on

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.300
intersections, some

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.980
popular game, like

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.440
Tower Defense, like

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.300
Clash of Clans.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.400
So we used Clash of

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.440
Clans or Boom

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.780
Beach as the game

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.440
based game part of

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:57.760
this.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.160
And add coding

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:00.500
there.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.180
And what kind of

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.120
game we can create?

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.120
What can it be?

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.860
So we start working

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.500
and this is what

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:06.860
happens.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.140
Empire of Code is

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.320
intersection, or

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.220
you can say it's

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.420
mixing of game

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.120
strategy, like

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.100
coding, like

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.360
Boom Beach, and

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:19.680
coding.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.660
So when you get

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.240
started out, you

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.600
have, you know, like

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.500
a base and you can

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.700
build attack type

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.960
units, like people

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.020
and whatnot, and

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.460
defensive ones, like

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.080
little turrets and

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.660
whatnot, like a

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.620
standard tower defense

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.040
game.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.480
But then how does

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.840
coding fit into this?

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.160
This is a good

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:39.580
question.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.740
One of the ideas

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.940
behind Empire of Code

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.020
is that you actually

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.280
can play this game

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.320
even without coding.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.300
So you should

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.560
somehow know how

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.840
to code in order to

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.020
progress in the game.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.460
In Empire of Code,

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.180
you don't need it.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.080
You just play the

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.340
game as long as you

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:57.540
want.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.660
But eventually,

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.620
some puzzles can

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.380
pop up and tell you,

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.320
okay, you can

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:04.920
improve this

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.160
building if you

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.940
solve this puzzle.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.020
You may not, but

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.180
if you solve this

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.320
puzzle, this

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.000
building that

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.300
produces resources

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.380
for your troops

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.560
can produce in a

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.380
more efficient way.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:19.620
So you might,

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:20.960
okay, good to

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.280
know.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.660
I'll get back to

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.260
it later.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.920
Or maybe you can

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.920
start right away.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.280
So this is one

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.400
part where coding

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.440
actually can be

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:31.740
used.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:32.940
And another

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.640
part of the

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.760
game is that

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.100
actually in order

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.040
to control your

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.280
troops in the

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.120
game, you should

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.660
do coding.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.640
So on the

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.780
coding, you can

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:43.620
control your

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.800
troops in the

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.040
battle.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.020
So I'll say it

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:46.220
again.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.200
You can control

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.360
your troops in the

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.000
battle by code.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.340
So you can say,

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.560
okay, this can go

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.520
at that point and

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.300
then attack this

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.960
tower by reading

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.420
a code.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.420
but in the

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.680
same time, we

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.320
give you some

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.500
basic strategy that

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.300
you can use without

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:03.680
going.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.200
So use whatever

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.020
strategy you want.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:06.700
And the

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.800
awesomest part of

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.500
this, the whole

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.780
game, is that the

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.620
whole game is the

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.580
competition between

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.140
two forces, Python

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:13.900
and JavaScript.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.700
So right after you

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.480
finish the tutorial,

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.720
you should choose

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.620
which side you want

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.020
to join.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:22.900
if you join a

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.280
Python site, you

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.580
can conquer

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.580
Python bases.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.640
You can only

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.860
conquer JavaScript

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:29.500
bases.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.320
And if you choose

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.380
JavaScript side, you

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.240
can only conquer

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.260
Python bases and

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.460
still resources from

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.180
that bases.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.800
So it's pretty fun

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.100
as well.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:39.600
That's really

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:39.820
awesome.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.700
So these puzzles

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.540
you solve around

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.580
like your buildings

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.580
and structures and

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.340
whatnot, is that a

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:45.980
little bit like

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.020
letting you mob the

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:47.300
game?

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.500
Like you can change

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.140
the behavior of the

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:49.360
thing?

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.240
Or is it more just

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.080
like you solve the

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.120
puzzles and it gets

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.740
more power?

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.420
Do you know what

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:53.560
I mean?

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.480
Like could I write

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.220
an algorithm that

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.200
would change the

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:56.920
way like say a

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.520
tower works as

00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.120
part of like

00:33:59.120 --> 00:33:59.680
improving it?

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.380
Or do I just

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.380
like solve a

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:01.900
puzzle and then

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.680
the tower goes up

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.120
a level or

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:03.360
something?

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.160
Thank you for

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:04.700
this question.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.360
Actually for

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.060
towers that defend

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.640
your base, there

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.220
are actually two

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.260
kinds of puzzles.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.400
The first kind of

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.260
puzzles is they

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.480
just after you

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.320
solve this puzzle,

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.020
the tower becomes

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.400
stronger or it

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.680
has more health

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.480
and it's hard to

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.020
destroy the

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:22.320
tower.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.360
And another

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.300
coding part of

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.480
this tower is you

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.560
actually can write

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.680
a strategy as

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.080
well as like you

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.100
are creating

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.000
strategy for your

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:34.540
troops in the

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.320
battle, you can

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.520
create strategy for

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.160
your defend tower.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.640
So for instance,

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.000
it can be, okay,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.220
if I see a heavy

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.760
bot running on me

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.560
and some small

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.080
bots that also

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.920
running on me

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.500
right now, I

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.320
would like to

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.340
destroy those

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.700
small bots first

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:56.540
and then I

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.220
start doing,

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.340
like I start

00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:58.900
destroying,

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.320
start attacking

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.080
those heavy

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.000
bots because it's

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.180
more efficient in

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:06.540
that way.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.220
So you can play

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.380
this strategy on

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.300
a defense base,

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.160
on a defense

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:11.640
building.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.600
Does it make

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:12.840
sense?

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.380
Yeah, yeah,

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.120
that's really cool.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:14.960
nice.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.700
Yeah, and you

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.760
can basically

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.340
when you get

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.100
into an area,

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:18.760
you can say

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.360
attack with this

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.580
strategy and then

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.080
you can actually

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:22.740
have like a little

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.760
editor for each

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.380
strategy, right?

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.100
Yeah, yeah.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.560
And one of the

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.460
awesome parts that I

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.640
love a lot, so do

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.780
you remember I said

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.160
that there's actually

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:31.960
competition between

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.200
two forces, Python

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.120
and JavaScript.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.040
But actually you

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.480
can ask your, if

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.300
you are playing for

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.420
Python, you can

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.500
ask your Python

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.100
fellows that also

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.080
play in this game,

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.420
can you test my

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.320
defense strategy?

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.440
And they actually

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.360
play against your

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.460
strategy, but the

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.640
difference is nobody,

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.880
they are not going

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.540
to lose their

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.560
troops and you're

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.240
not going to lose

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.740
any resources in

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:55.400
any cases.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.300
So you can use

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.980
your teammates for

00:35:58.980 --> 00:35:59.660
testing your

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.640
strategies, for

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.060
testing your defense

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.080
and attack strategy.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.380
Yeah, that's really

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:04.660
cool.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.160
Thanks.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.280
Yeah, it seems like

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:06.820
a fun game.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.680
I wasn't able to

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.720
play it super far

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.660
into the game, but

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.680
it's definitely a

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.180
cool idea.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:11.940
I like it.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.580
And that's also a

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:13.280
web-based game,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:13.500
right?

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.540
Yeah, it's

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.820
completely web-based,

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.000
HTML5.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:32.560
We all want to

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.200
ship our software

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.360
faster, respond to

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.640
user requests, and

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.420
build an edge on

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:36.980
the competition.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.320
But the faster you

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.400
go, the more likely

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.340
a bug or issue will

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.240
slip by and cause

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.040
your users grief.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.060
I have the same

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:43.740
trade-offs with my

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.660
Talk Python websites

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.260
and infrastructure.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.380
That's why I use

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:46.960
SnapCI.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.320
Every time I check in

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.500
at GitHub, SnapCI

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.560
springs into action.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.180
A clean copy of code

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:52.860
is pulled from GitHub,

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.200
a Python 3 virtual

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:54.880
environment is created,

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.020
all the packages and

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:56.640
dependencies are

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.720
installed, the unit

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.340
tests are run,

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.860
finally I'm notified in

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:00.940
Slack and a menu bar

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:01.780
on my Mac about the

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.100
outcome.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.300
That way I know it's

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.440
safe to ship a shiny

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.520
new version of my web

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:05.740
app.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.360
Ship your software faster

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.800
with a 30-day free trial

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.860
at snap.ci

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.140
slash Talk Python.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.040
It's kind of played on

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:20.960
like a tablet or a

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.720
phone, on the browser

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.100
on them.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.500
It's not very adapted

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.560
for iPhone right now,

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.720
but we are working on

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:27.860
it.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.440
The most efficient way

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.580
to play in this game

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.180
is from your desktop.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:33.680
Yeah.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.660
Yeah, sure.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.380
Any browser.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:36.080
Something with a

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.000
keyboard and a mouse.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:37.400
Cool.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.940
So, I haven't brought

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:40.800
it up yet because it's

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.240
not super relevant to

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.280
the audience necessarily,

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.480
but one of the things

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.600
you guys did just add,

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.760
and you touched on it

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.820
here, is you've

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.420
recently added

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.440
JavaScript support.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.300
Like, it used to be

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.940
just Python for, say,

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:52.740
like the Czech I.O.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.460
puzzles, but now you

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.300
have JavaScript versions

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:54.880
as well, right?

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.320
Yeah.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.840
So, in Czech I.O.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.320
we decide not to

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.180
create a lot of

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.260
languages at one time.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.960
So, a lot of

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.640
coding puzzles,

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.360
coding games,

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.740
or something like that,

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.660
they are adding

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.800
many languages

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.760
in one time.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.840
So, 20 different

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.240
languages.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.240
you can use any

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.040
of your favorite

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:13.940
languages in order

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:14.840
to solve the puzzle.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.480
First of all,

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.860
we were in Python.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.840
We tested a lot

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.900
of different ideas.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:22.980
What does work,

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.020
what doesn't work.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.480
And then, later,

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.300
when we figured out,

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.020
okay, we have

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.420
pretty solid ideas,

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.540
and we can replicate

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:29.880
it.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.300
The next language

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.160
to try

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.440
for us

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.720
become a JavaScript.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.980
So, we decided

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:38.880
to start growing

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.500
JavaScript communities.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.740
Since JavaScript

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.860
become more and more

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.320
popular,

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.080
there are a lot

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.320
of new frameworks,

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.760
new ideas

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.720
coming out

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.080
of the JavaScript,

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.120
and there are

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.580
new fancy ways

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.680
to coding JavaScript,

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.780
like React,

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:55.860
and so on and so on.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.100
So, we decided

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.000
to create something

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.200
for JavaScript

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.360
community as well,

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.580
since we are all

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.380
coding JavaScript

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:02.920
somehow,

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.020
and want to learn

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.480
how to do it

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.400
in a more efficient way.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.940
So, we just

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:08.980
recently released

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.100
JavaScript Checker

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.620
for JavaScript players.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.840
So, the Checker

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.560
become a portal

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.980
between Python coders,

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.120
between Python Checker

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.280
and JavaScript Checker.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.240
But, every portal

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.320
is still independent.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.640
So, in Python,

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.380
we are talking

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.480
only about Python.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.000
All the solutions

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.940
only about Python.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.000
And in JavaScript,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.180
it's also independent.

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.140
So, yes.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:34.760
Yeah, okay.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.380
Yeah, very,

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:35.820
very cool.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.000
So, if you're

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.420
into JavaScript,

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.440
also, I'll do

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.340
something here for you.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.660
Nice.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.300
Now, one of the things

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.060
I like when I go

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:42.700
to a mission

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.760
is,

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.860
if I go there,

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.880
it has like a

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:47.640
summary description,

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.340
then a button

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.060
to solve it,

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:49.980
and that's cool.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.980
But it also has

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:52.960
a GitHub link

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.540
at the bottom

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:54.760
to the actual

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.840
problem,

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.840
the verification,

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.680
and everything.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.720
And they're stored

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.720
in various places,

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.740
but one of the places

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:02.920
that has a whole

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.500
bunch of them

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.840
is github.com

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.640
slash checkio-missions.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.980
And you guys

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.780
have many,

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.500
many pages

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.880
of the solutions

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.620
and the starter code,

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.340
because often you

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.400
start with starter code

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:14.960
and little tests

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.320
and whatnot.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.020
I think that's

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:17.700
a really cool touch

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.400
that each one

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.000
of these missions

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.660
or puzzles,

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:19.980
rather,

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:20.720
you can go

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.120
and see the code for.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.600
Yeah.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.160
So,

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.100
what we decide

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.080
is we decide

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.660
to open source

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.340
those puzzles,

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.180
and there are

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.220
some reasons for that.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.280
first of all,

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.780
while we're creating

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:33.600
some puzzles,

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.240
we often make

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.940
some mistakes,

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.140
like we forgot

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.520
to add some tests,

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.620
and after you go

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.540
through the solution,

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.640
you think,

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.040
okay,

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.480
this is the wrong solution,

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.660
it shouldn't work.

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:50.600
And you go

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.760
to a mission repository

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.760
and see,

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.040
okay,

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:54.820
they don't have

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.920
this test,

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.040
and they should have.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.080
And you create

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:58.880
a pull request

00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.320
to us

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.300
that explains

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.000
you guys

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
should add this test,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.660
and we add

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.400
this new test

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.120
for this mission

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:05.980
and test

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.440
all the solutions

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.220
once again.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:08.700
So,

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.220
one of the reasons

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.880
is so the community

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.540
can improve

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.200
our mission.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:13.440
Yeah,

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.380
I think if you're

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.260
looking at a problem

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:15.860
and you're like,

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.140
oh,

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.300
but it's not testing this,

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.180
and this person

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:18.760
who says they have

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.200
a solution,

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:19.980
it's not really

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.780
the right solution,

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.100
that can be frustrating.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:22.880
so you could just

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.080
go do a GitHub pull request

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:24.280
and go,

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.180
I'm at another test,

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:25.980
right?

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.700
Something like this.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:26.840
Yeah,

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.160
that's cool.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:27.620
Also,

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.360
what we allow

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.280
our community

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.760
is to provide

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.420
a translation

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.020
permission.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.240
So,

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:33.740
actually,

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.400
you can,

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.480
each mission

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.120
has up to

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.260
seven different

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:38.700
languages.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.320
So,

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.020
you can choose

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:40.620
which language

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:41.340
you want to

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.620
read this particular

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.120
mission.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:43.900
And we have

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:44.480
a lot of

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.480
Chinese translation,

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:45.980
Russian,

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.580
of course,

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.220
Ukrainian,

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.500
Spanish,

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.380
and German.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:49.840
So,

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.480
a lot of

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.460
people can

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.140
just commit

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.000
a new translation

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.080
just from

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:54.460
GitHub.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.500
They just go

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.380
and create

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.500
a new pull request

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.380
with new translation

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.260
and we just

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.400
merge this pull request

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.080
and check

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.700
have one more

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:05.720
new translation.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.520
This particular

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.220
mission have

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:07.800
one more

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.520
new translation.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.600
And,

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.440
for instance,

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.060
if I'm

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.200
native Russian

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.200
and Ukrainian

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:13.920
speaker,

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.840
I can see

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.400
translation,

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.540
Russian translation,

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:16.980
okay,

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:17.720
this is not

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.380
correct and

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.200
go and make

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:19.840
a pull request

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.180
in this

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.260
translation and

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:21.720
make this

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.460
translation even

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:22.860
better.

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:23.780
So,

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.220
yeah.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:24.640
Yeah,

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.180
that is really

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:25.480
cool.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:25.900
Yeah.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.840
And also,

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.340
an additional

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:28.740
way,

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.780
additional thing

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.380
that you can

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.540
actually improve

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.080
in CheckIO

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:32.900
is that we

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.500
actually have

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.040
a set of

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:34.640
hints for

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.260
some mission.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:35.920
So,

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.680
if you're

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.220
stuck in

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:37.620
a solving

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:38.140
mission,

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:38.880
we have

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.460
a set of

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:39.900
hints

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.280
and that

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:42.940
allows you

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:43.540
with small

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.060
pushes

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.400
that can

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.580
get you

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.460
in the right

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:48.900
way by

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:49.500
doing this

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.200
small push

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:50.520
like,

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:50.880
okay,

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.480
maybe you

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.180
should try

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.360
to Google

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.700
this thing.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:55.380
Maybe,

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:55.900
what do you

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:56.580
think if we,

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.180
here is the

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.060
link on

00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:58.600
a Python

00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.080
tutorial,

00:42:59.080 --> 00:42:59.700
maybe you

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:00.460
can find

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:01.240
something here.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:01.760
So,

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.600
those small

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.000
pushes,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.060
we call

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:04.460
hints.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.900
And,

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.280
you can do

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.000
a pull request

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:10.960
and give us

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.180
some hints

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.400
for this

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:13.780
mission.

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:14.300
that's really

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:14.560
cool.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.720
Can I

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.120
create my

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:16.280
own

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:16.540
mission?

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:16.880
Like,

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.780
if I want

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:18.200
to add a

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:18.820
mission to

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:19.700
the scientific

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.360
expedition

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.200
island,

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:21.980
how do I

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.320
do that?

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.140
We have a

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:23.840
set of tools

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.800
for mission

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.440
creatives.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.000
And,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.440
actually,

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.020
there are a lot

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:28.660
of missions that

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.360
was created

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.640
by other

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.440
users who

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.220
has an idea.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.140
Sometimes,

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:33.960
users can just

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.460
send me an

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:34.740
email.

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.740
I have an

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.360
awesome idea,

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:36.820
but I don't

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:37.840
have time to

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:38.700
create it.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:39.600
Can you create it?

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:40.080
Yes,

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:40.460
of course,

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.120
we can create

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.580
this mission

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:41.880
for you.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:42.200
But,

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:42.500
sometimes,

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.200
users just

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.360
create those

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:44.880
missions by

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.360
themselves.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:45.640
And,

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.280
if you find

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.180
in the

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:47.520
mission,

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.720
the right

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.540
panel of

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:49.980
the mission,

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.020
there are

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:51.740
a page

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:52.940
with

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.460
after name

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:54.960
on this

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.300
page.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:55.760
So,

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.500
each mission

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.760
has their

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.420
own after

00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.320
who created

00:43:59.320 --> 00:43:59.560
that,

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.160
who actually

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:00.740
created this

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:00.900
mission.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:01.060
Yeah,

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:01.500
that's cool.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.060
I saw that.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:02.720
Is there

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.980
criteria for

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.780
taking a

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.140
mission or

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:05.400
not?

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:05.620
Like,

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:05.940
if somebody

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:06.300
makes a

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:06.720
mission and

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.400
it's basically

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:07.940
the same as

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:08.200
another,

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:08.760
would you say,

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.280
thanks,

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.240
but no?

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:10.940
Or,

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.020
what do you

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:12.560
look for

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.300
when somebody

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.180
comes with

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:14.520
an idea?

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.580
We have

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:16.080
some

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:16.960
procedure

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.200
in order

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:18.840
to accept

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.480
this mission

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.140
to

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.440
Checker

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:21.660
Map.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:22.160
So,

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:22.700
every

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.960
person who

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:24.580
created this

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:24.960
mission,

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.140
he should

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:26.840
submit this

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.600
mission first

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.940
on the

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:31.280
forum,

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.540
in some

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:33.180
specific

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:33.760
section of

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.200
the forum,

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.360
and where

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.500
experienced

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:37.140
players who

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:37.660
played a lot

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:38.100
in Checker,

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:38.420
they,

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:39.280
first of all,

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.760
those group

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.320
of people,

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.860
they are

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:43.840
mainly for

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.800
testing those

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.400
candidate

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.160
missions or

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:46.500
whatever,

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.140
candidate

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:47.540
puzzles.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:48.120
Yes.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.620
And almost

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.560
all the time

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.360
they can propose

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.080
some changes.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.060
The mission

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:53.640
definition,

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.720
puzzle definition

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.620
is wrong,

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.800
or maybe

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.820
some tests

00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:58.600
are missed,

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.040
or whatever.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:00.940
There are some

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:01.740
various,

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:02.980
so they are

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:03.520
starting to

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.060
discuss.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:05.980
those mission

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:06.300
after,

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.600
he is taking

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.200
part in

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:08.880
the mission

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.440
discussion,

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.160
and after

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:10.580
this,

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:11.240
we have

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.240
pretty solid

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.280
mission.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.200
After that,

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.600
our team

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.640
member can

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.520
improve this

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.080
mission as

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:18.300
well.

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.140
For instance,

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:19.920
we can add

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.060
some animation

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:21.980
part in this

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:22.280
part,

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.000
or try it

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.360
panel,

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.300
or maybe

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.300
our designers

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:25.940
want to

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:26.200
create

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:26.640
illustration

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.400
for this

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:27.720
mission.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.540
So,

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:29.420
we also

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:30.080
take part

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:30.360
in the

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:30.560
mission

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:30.960
creation.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.200
And after

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:32.600
that,

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.380
we put

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:33.580
this

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:33.820
mission

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.140
on the

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:34.420
island.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.800
And if

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.020
you

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:36.760
subscribe

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.520
on

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.980
Checker

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.400
newsletter,

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.600
you will

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:40.980
get

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.560
in use

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.060
that we

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:44.420
have

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:45.380
some new

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:45.760
missions

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.600
coming out,

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.320
and you

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.000
can be the

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:48.600
first one

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.360
who tried

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:49.800
and played

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.360
this mission.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.060
That's awesome.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:51.740
Yeah,

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:52.200
very cool.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:52.460
I love it.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.220
That sounds

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:53.680
really great.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.440
And I like

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:54.740
that you

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:55.060
add

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.240
illustrations

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:56.860
and stuff

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:57.220
and kind

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:57.560
of make

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.120
it feel

00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:58.820
more part

00:45:58.820 --> 00:45:59.100
of the

00:45:59.100 --> 00:45:59.460
thing

00:45:59.460 --> 00:45:59.800
once they

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.380
add it.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:00.780
Thanks.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:01.160
We have

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:01.960
very cool

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:02.860
and very

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:03.860
passionate

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.620
designers

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:04.900
team.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:05.280
Yeah,

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:05.860
the designers

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.340
definitely

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.180
are doing

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:07.700
nice work

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:07.900
there.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:08.220
Like I

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:08.400
said,

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.820
the overall

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:10.220
view of

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:10.600
the islands

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.260
is just

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:11.860
totally

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:12.220
beautiful.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.120
It's great.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:13.700
So,

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:14.060
I want to

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:14.520
touch on

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.220
two things

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:15.920
really quickly

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.260
before we,

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.260
maybe three,

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:18.920
before we

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.300
call it a

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:20.520
show.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.180
So,

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:21.980
one of the

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:22.340
ones I

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:22.680
wanted to

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.080
ask you

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:23.580
about is

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.200
you said

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:24.620
there's

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:25.380
something like

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:25.920
a Czech

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.120
IO

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:26.820
classroom

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.640
or something

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.160
like that.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.040
What's the

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:29.440
story there?

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:29.760
Yeah,

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:30.220
as I

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:30.500
mentioned

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:30.980
before,

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:31.620
there are

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.640
a lot

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:32.840
of

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.540
universities

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:34.240
and

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:34.560
some

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.060
classes

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:35.340
and

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:35.720
teachers

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.480
who

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:36.680
are

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.280
using

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.160
Czech

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:38.320
IO

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:38.680
as

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:38.800
an

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.120
additional

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:39.660
material.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.360
So,

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.200
you know,

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:41.560
guys,

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.580
just take

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.820
this site

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.280
and you

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:44.880
use whatever

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:45.360
you want

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:45.800
to use

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:46.800
and just

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.200
improve

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:47.600
your

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.200
skills

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:48.500
there.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:49.260
so,

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:50.900
we want

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.300
to help

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:52.820
those

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.180
teachers

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:53.860
in their

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:54.220
class.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:54.920
We

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.980
give them

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:56.560
an additional

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.300
functionality.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.140
We give

00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.100
them more

00:46:59.100 --> 00:46:59.760

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.140
on Czech

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:00.260
IO.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:00.740
So,

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:01.960
if you

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.440
are a

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.160
teacher who

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:04.540
is actually

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:04.800
teaching

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.140
class,

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:05.680
you can

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.120
put all

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:06.280
your

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:06.720

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.100
in

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:07.260
Czech

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:07.400
IO

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:07.860
and

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.020
they

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:08.160
will

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:08.320
be

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:08.440
in

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:08.660
some

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:08.980
group.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:09.800
And

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:10.220
while

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:10.620
they

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:11.640
explore in

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:11.760
the

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.080
world,

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:12.440
while

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:12.820
they're

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:13.180
solving

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:13.680
puzzles,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:14.400
they can

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:14.840
interact

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.020
with

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:15.160
each

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:15.380
other.

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:15.980
So,

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:16.340
those

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:16.800
activity

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:19.940
activity

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:20.340
become

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:20.560

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:21.400
activity

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:21.720

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:24.500
member.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:25.060
If

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:25.240
you

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:25.540
solve

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:30.860
can

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.040
And

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.360
what

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:36.560

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:37.160
We

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:54.320
that

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:54.760

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:56.640

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.080
So,

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:57.780
what

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:58.220
actually

Classroom

00:47:58.780 --> 00:47:59.200
is doing

00:47:59.200 --> 00:47:59.860
is just

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:00.180
give

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:00.520
some,

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.280
we

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:01.440
don't

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:01.640
want

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:01.800
to

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.700
but

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.040
we

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:05.380
want

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:05.580
to

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:05.900
give

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.300

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:08.760
teachers

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.660
so

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:10.020
they

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:10.420
can

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:10.920
keep

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.180
their

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:11.500

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:11.880
together.

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:12.160
Yeah,

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.440
that's

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:12.700
really

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:13.280
nice

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:13.620
and if

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:13.880
you go

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.280
into one

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:14.500
of the

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:14.740
pages

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:15.140
like your

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:15.940
profile page

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.280
that has

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:16.760
a footer

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.720
there's a

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.500
class manager

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:18.840
at the

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.040
bottom

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:19.280
and it

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:19.480
looks

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:19.800
really

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.140
easy.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:20.800
So,

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.280
let me

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:21.580
give you

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:21.820
a few

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:22.280
scenarios

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:22.520
and you

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:22.780
tell me

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:23.060
if this

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:23.480
makes sense

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.480
is

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:24.800
one

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:24.820
one

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:25.000
thing

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.920
I

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:26.060
could

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:26.280
do

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:26.420
is

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:26.600
I

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:26.780
could

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:27.040
create

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:27.180
a

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:27.700
class

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:28.080
and

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:28.200
the

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:28.520
class

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:28.700
could

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:29.000
be

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.600
talk

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:29.940
Python

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.340
listeners

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.440
and

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:31.820
everyone

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:32.000
who

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:32.220
listens

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:32.360
to

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:32.480
the

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:32.800
podcast

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.220
could

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:33.440
they

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:33.820
be

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:33.960
in

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.060
a

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:34.380
class

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:34.520
and

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:34.780
go

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:34.940
through

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:35.060
it

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:35.320
together

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:35.600
and

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:35.900
share

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:36.340
ideas

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:36.920
as a

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:37.120
group?

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.340
Yes,

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.040
yes.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:39.340
So,

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:40.080
if you

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:40.560
are creating

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:40.740
a

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:41.000
class

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:41.180
you

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:41.360
have

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:41.520
two

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:41.860
options.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:42.180
First

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:42.500
option

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:42.940
you

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:43.140
can

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:43.480
simply

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:43.740
put

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:43.980
all

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:44.140
the

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:44.500
emails

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:44.780
that

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:45.120
you

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:45.700
think

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:46.380
you

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:46.620
want

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:46.740
to

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:46.960
add

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.080
in

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:47.260
this

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:47.620
class

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:47.900
in

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.080
the

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:48.480
specific

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:48.900
text

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:49.260
field

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:49.620
and

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:49.960
then

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.680
put

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:50.960
some

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.460
messages

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:51.760
out

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:52.020
there

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:52.280
and

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:52.500
just

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:52.740
send

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:52.880
it

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.060
out.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:53.340
This

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:53.440
is

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:53.560
the

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:53.800
first

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:54.220
option.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.040
And

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:55.180
the

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:55.400
second

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:55.780
option

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.020
you

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:56.220
can

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:56.620
just

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.260
provide

00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:58.580
you

00:48:58.580 --> 00:48:58.760
with

00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:58.880
the

00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.140
link

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.440
and

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.120
this

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:01.580
link

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:02.360
has

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.640
a

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.040
page

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:04.320
of

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:04.560
your

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.040
class

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.120
and

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:06.460
some

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:06.840
button

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.540
below

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:07.980
that

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:08.820
actually

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:09.580
tells

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.080
I

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:10.340
want

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:10.460
to

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:10.700
join

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:10.880
to

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.100
this

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:11.440
class.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.220
The

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:12.400
only

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:12.780
thing

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:12.980
that

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:13.140
you

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:13.340
should

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:13.580
done

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:13.840
after

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.220
join

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:14.740
you

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:14.960
as

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.380
a class

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:15.840
creator

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:16.320
should

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:16.660
go

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:17.080
and

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:17.500
approve

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:17.800
this

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.900
joining

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:19.420
right?

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:19.900
I see.

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:20.340
And

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.460
after that

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:21.780
you can

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.140
have the

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:22.400
whole

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:22.820
class

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:23.780
just

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:24.180
for

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.140
your

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:25.500
podcast

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:25.960
listeners.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:26.520
Okay.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:26.920
Cool.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:27.260
Yeah.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:27.680
Also

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.140
like for

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:28.320
some

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:28.540
of my

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:28.820
online

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:29.160
courses

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:29.500
maybe

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:29.860
I'll

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:30.720
see if

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:30.860
I can

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:31.000
create

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:31.320
a class.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:31.860
I'll

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:32.160
look into

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:32.260
it.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:32.420
That's

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:32.600
very

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:32.820
cool.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:33.600
Thanks.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:33.960
Yeah.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.640
I will

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.060
create

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:35.500
additional

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:35.800
video

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:36.320
tutorial

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.000
that I

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:37.100
will

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:37.460
explain

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:38.060
all the

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:38.520
features

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.460
and I

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:39.600
will

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:39.860
share

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:40.040
it

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:40.540
and check

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:40.720
out

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.160
so you

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:41.420
can

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:41.940
go

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:42.200
there

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:42.600
and see

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.020
how

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:43.660
exactly

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:43.880
it

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:44.180
works

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:44.600
and how

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:44.740
you

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:44.900
can

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:45.260
use it.

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:45.500
Okay.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:45.860
Excellent.

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:46.060
Yeah.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:46.420
And I'll

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:46.700
try to

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:46.960
link to

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.420
that if

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:47.980
the timing

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:48.540
lines up.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:49.560
Cool.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.520
So that's

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:50.840
one thing

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.060
I wanted

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:51.400
to cover.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.080
The other

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:52.620
is can

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:52.880
you give

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.200
us a

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:53.580
look

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:54.140
behind the

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:54.480
scenes

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:54.780
at the

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:55.280
technology

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:55.740
involved?

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.500
Like are

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:56.840
you using

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.220
Django?

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.000
Are you using

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.400
Docker?

00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.280
Like how's

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.020
Python in the

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:00.360
backend

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:00.880
working?

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.420
Like those

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:01.720
kinds of

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:01.980
things.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:02.400
Yeah.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:02.860
I would

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:03.200
love to.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.960
So we

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.560
are using

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.000
Django

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.300
for

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:07.900
web

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.200
part.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:08.900
Also for

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:09.380
running

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:10.240
coding

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.020
solutions,

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:11.820
running user

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.440
solutions.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.220
We're using

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.860
Twisted and

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.520
we're using

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:15.880
Docker.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.340
So every

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.060
mission is

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:22.640
covered in

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:22.960
Docker

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.180
container and

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:24.860
running in

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:25.200
the Docker

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:25.720
container.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.600
And all

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.180
these runs

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:29.320
and all

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.760
those runnings

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.560
are actually

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.040
managed

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:32.520
by

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.580
Twisted

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:34.060
server.

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.280
And that's

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:35.520
cool.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.580
Is that also

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.020
for Empire

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:38.380
of Code?

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.180
Yeah.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.040
The same

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:40.680
kind of

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.400
things actually

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.440
working for

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:42.940
Empire of

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:43.420
Code but

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.080
we make

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:45.460
it a little

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:45.960
bit different

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.600
for Empire

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.080
of Code.

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.280
We actually

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.380
every mission

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.160
is actually

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:50.980
Docker

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:52.360
container and

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.080
for every

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:53.580
mission we

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:54.700
have somehow

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:55.620
prepared the

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:55.860
Docker

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.360
container before

00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:57.840
the run.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.120
And it's

00:50:59.120 --> 00:50:59.880
actually a

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:00.280
little bit

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.000
more efficient.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.100
I'm not

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:02.260
sure.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:02.620
I think

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:03.260
this part

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:03.740
may be

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:04.240
too much

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:04.700
detail.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.140
Yeah.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:05.820
We don't

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:06.140
have to go

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:06.540
into too

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:06.780
much of

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:07.180
the details

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:07.580
but I

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.220
saw it

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:09.580
will take

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:09.820
a few

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:10.360
moments for

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:10.600
us to

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.480
deploy your

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:12.640
army to

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.240
this asteroid.

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:13.700
I'm thinking

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:14.420
oh is that a

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:15.080
Docker container

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:15.520
because it's

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:16.140
running your

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.000
code strategy

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:17.420
and stuff

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:17.820
like that.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:19.760
yeah we

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.180
we had a

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:20.460
lot of

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:20.880
complaints

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.140
from

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:21.940
why don't

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.460
you show

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:23.940
me

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.260
progressively

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:25.960
how my

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:26.460
army is

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:26.760
going.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.700
Yeah we

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:28.180
are actually

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:28.940
running all

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:29.480
the code

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.540
and then

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.240
show you

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:31.880
the result.

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.120
Yeah cool.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.340
Awesome.

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.180
All right well

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:36.720
we're getting

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.280
pretty much out

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:37.820
of time so I

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.180
think maybe

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:38.500
we'll leave

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:38.900
it there.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:39.920
But Alex this

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:40.800
has been a

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.400
super interesting

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.480
look where

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.120
Check.io came

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.160
from and where

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:44.560
it's going.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.760
So thanks for

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:45.940
that.

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:46.640
Thank you.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.160
Thank you for

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:47.940
inviting me here.

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:48.960
It was great.

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.200
It was a big

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:50.840
pleasure for me

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.580
to share all

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.240
the ideas.

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:52.740
You're welcome.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.460
Now before I

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:53.960
let you go I

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.260
have two

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:54.780
questions I

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.340
always ask my

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:55.620
guests.

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:56.560
The first one

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:57.220
is I just

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:57.740
checked there

00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.020
are if I

00:51:59.020 --> 00:51:59.480
look at

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.820
pypi.io

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:01.780
which is the

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:02.680
shiny new

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.640
Python package

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.060
index.

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:04.980
It's still it

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:05.500
says it's in

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.200
beta but the

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:06.880
backing data

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:07.520
store is the

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.580
production data

00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:09.460
store so you

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:09.820
might as well

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:10.440
use the pretty

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:10.700
one.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:11.660
If you look

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.060
there there's

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:13.560
88,000 plus

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.540
packages today

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.100
which is amazing.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.100
It's so

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:17.720
amazing right?

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.020
And of those

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.880
there's tons that

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.720
you're exposed to

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.540
that people maybe

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.060
don't know about.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:22.480
Is there a

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.040
favorite one you're

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:23.780
like hey everyone

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:24.300
should know about

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:25.080
this but they

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:25.540
probably haven't

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:25.980
heard of it.

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:27.260
I think everybody

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.200
heard about Django

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.320
so I think this is

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.420
my favorite package

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:31.860
that I'm using a

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.180
lot so yeah Django

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.300
is one of my

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.300
favorite and I

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.320
don't have any

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.120
fancy one that I

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:38.780
think everybody

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:39.440
should use.

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.440
Yeah all right so

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.420
Django check it out

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:41.900
very cool.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:42.800
And if you're going

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.680
to write Python code

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.660
and it's not in

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.520
your online editor

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.920
what what editor

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.620
do you open up?

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:48.940
I'm using PyCharm.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:49.860
This is definitely

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.080
one of my favorite

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:51.880
code editor.

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.140
Yeah I love

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:53.700
PyCharm too.

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.260
I use it for

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.300
almost all my

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.120
Python work and

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.080
it's one of those

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:58.600
things that you

00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.200
kind of have to

00:52:59.200 --> 00:52:59.940
take a moment and

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:01.060
learn but as you

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:01.760
learn more features

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.340
they add up you're

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.180
just like okay I

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:03.680
have to use this

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:03.880
thing.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.800
It's very cool and

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:06.460
I think it's awesome

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:07.020
that they're partnering

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.140
with you so well

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:08.980
