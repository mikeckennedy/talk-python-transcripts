00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.680
Now, let me introduce Patrick.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.320
Patrick Shanizen is a member of the technical staff at Docker Inc.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.640
He helps build Docker, an open platform for distributed applications for developers and sysadmins.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.300
Patrick is a software developer and storyteller.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.960
He has spent 10 years building platforms at Netscape and Sun, 10 more evangelizing platforms

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.120
at Google, VMware, and Microsoft.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.300
His main professional interest is in building and kickstarting the network effects for these

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.780
wondrous two-sided markets called platforms.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.400
He worked on platforms for portals, ads, commerce, social, web, distributed apps, and of course,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.980
the cloud.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.620
Patrick, welcome to the show.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.400
Hey, Michael.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.480
Thanks for having me.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.160
Hey, I'm really glad that you're here, and I'm super excited to have Docker on the show.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.720
Ever since I learned about Docker, there's a few times I've learned about some technology,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.080
and it has completely taken over me, and somehow I'm obsessed to learn it.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.300
And when I figured, when I came across Docker, when you guys announced it, I don't know, was

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.180
it a year ago?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.720
Two years, about two years ago, right?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.460
Yeah, I came across it, and I'm just, oh my gosh, I need to learn this.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.960
I need to understand this, because this is going to be huge.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.620
And I really think Docker and these container technologies are going to change the way we

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.400
build and deliver software.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.360
So let's start with telling the world, what is Docker, for those who don't know?

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.860
Sure.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:50.500
So Docker is an open source project that was announced by Solomon Haidt, the founder of

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.720
.cloud and Docker, two years ago at PyCon.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.940
So it's relevant for Python developers, because it all started at PyCon.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.400
And so Solomon and his team were building this platform as a service called .cloud, and they

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.260
were struggling with that option.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.200
It's a time when, at that time I was at Google, I was doing a Google App Engine.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.260
There was Heroku, who's been bought by Salesforce.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.960
And so .cloud had trouble attracting developers to their platform as a service, which allowed

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.920
you to deploy applications in PHP, Python, and multiple languages.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.480
Well, at the time, a platform like Google App Engine, for example, was limited to Python

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.120
and Java as runtimes, and Go as well.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.760
And so they were struggling with adoption, but they had this gem inside of .cloud that they

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.400
were using to build their platform as a service that was called Docker.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:58.400
And that was an easy way to package and distribute, build, ship, and run Linux containers.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.340
And so they open-sourced the project at PyCon two years ago.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.980
And then it took the world by storm.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.720
Like all developers starting adopting it.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.340
And the whole industry restructured around that notion of Linux container.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:25.080
So Docker essentially is a set of tools that allow you to build, ship, and run distributed applications based on Linux containers.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:34.020
So there's the Docker command line, which is at the same time, it's a unique binary that has a client and a daemon.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:49.840
And the daemon lets you get images for containers on your local machine or on a server and run them in a Linux container, like isolated from other workloads on that machine.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.780
So you can have your own file system, your own users, your own network namespace.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.780
And so Docker is based on Linux namespaces and C groups.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:17.840
And then you have Docker machine that lets you provision machines running the Docker engine on any cloud provider, like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, but also locally on your machine on VMware, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.780
So Docker itself, Docker machine to provision the machines.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:41.840
Then there's another project called Docker Compose that allows you to assemble all these containers that you're using to build your microservices into a single unit that you can run on your laptop for development or ship to the cloud as a single unit.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.780
So typically you would have, for your typical Python app, maybe you're using Django or Flask.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.780
You would have one container that has Django, your Django application with its code in it.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.780
And you would link that to another container that has Redis on MySQL.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.780
And then you can start all this with a single command, Docker Compose.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.660
So you can, with Docker Compose, you can just start.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.460
Yes, exactly.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.760
So in Docker Compose, you say, I have my image for my Django app.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.060
Let's call it like, let's call it like, my Django app.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:28.940
I want to launch that with port 80 on the machine, on the server on which it's running, mapped to port 8080, maybe internally, where I'm running it.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:35.880
And then I want to tie that to a Redis instance that's using the Docker image Redis that's on Docker Hub.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:45.560
And then inside of my code, I'm just going to refer to Redis and automatically it will just tie that to the other container that's running.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.580

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:29.000
Check them out at CodeChip.com and tell them thanks for sponsoring the show on Twitter where they're at CodeChip.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So before we get into the details of how we run all that, you know, it's interesting that Docker kind of grew out of what was supposed to be kind of a larger project, right?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.360
Yeah.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.620
A platform as a service company, if you will.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.920
It was just, it was just, that was how you guys were trying to internally achieve greater density for your hosting.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.780
Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:03.600
And the notion of running Linux containers has been around for a really long time.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.460
Or actually containers themselves have been around for a long time with three BSD gels.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:18.020
In the, like, 2005, there was already the notion of Solaris containers in Solaris.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.680
So that notion of containers existing for a long time.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:36.220
And that's the way Google is running its workloads inside of Google data centers, using Linux containers for isolation in order to be able to run workloads with a very high density,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:43.220
because it's using Linux or operating system virtualization.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:53.300
So that's a super important difference or distinction to make between these containers and virtual machines.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:09:02.400
So if I create a virtual machine, maybe it's a couple of gigs for the file system and the operating system and all my data and everything I've done to it.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.360
Maybe it uses two gigs of RAM when I start and stop it.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.740
It's got to boot up like a regular machine.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.320
You know, it's a big blocky thing.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.740
How big are these Docker containers?

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:12.720
Yeah, they can.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.460
So Docker containers compared to virtual machines can be much smaller.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:21.180
They can be big as well, but usually they're much smaller.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:32.380
And another advantage they have over VMs is that the image format for Docker images, they are layered.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:41.060
So you build a layer, you can say, oh, I'm going to inherit from the Ubuntu layer, and then I'm going to install Python on that.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.840
And then I'm going to use pip to install my requirements on that.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:55.500
Each of these instructions generates a different layer, and when you're using the Docker pool to pull the image or Docker run to run that image,

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:02.180
what it's doing is that it's looking in its local cache to see, oh, hey, I have Ubuntu already in there.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:09.160
So I'm just going to download the image that adds Python to it and then the one with the requirements for my app.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:15.320
So there's an additional density in terms of storage as well that goes with it.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:26.160
While when you're packaging your app for a VM, you're just building that monolithic VM image with everything from the version of Linux or Windows that you're running in there,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:35.060
the full operating system, plus your application code and packaging, and every VM you start has all these data.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:43.780
While if you're running like 10 different Python applications package as a container on one host,

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:53.600
you would have one time the data for the Ubuntu VM, that's your base, and then maybe one layer for Python,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:00.640
and then small layers 10 times for the requirements and the code base for your Python application.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.960
So the images are lighter.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.800
And what that means is that they download much faster.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.180
Another aspect is that at runtime, it's much faster.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:15.100
So starting a container, once your image is cached locally, just take like a few milliseconds.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:23.860
While, as you know, to start a VM, it takes a good 20 to 30 seconds in good cases.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.960
Yeah, that's really amazing.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.560
And I like the layering concept.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:36.440
So every layer you add brings you closer and closer to the specific type of operating system and environment you need for your app.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.120
So at first, it's just Linux, and that could be anything.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.340
Yeah.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.140
And then it's Linux plus your version of Python.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.200
And so it's a little closer.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.320
And then maybe it's that plus Nginx.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.500
And then it's a little closer.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:56.360
And then it's that version of Linux plus Python plus Nginx plus all the packages your web app depends upon.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.740
And then finally, maybe it's your code.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:04.180
And so you can use every one of those layers as a building block to create new ones and things like that, right?

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.500
Yeah, it's very composable.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:17.300
So once you have created your base layer, anybody in your team or if you make it public on Docker Hub can inherit from that and add their own stuff.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:27.540
Or you can go up in the chain of inheritance of layers and say, oh, I don't like the official Python layer.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.360
I'm going to see what operating system they're using to run it, and maybe I'm going to create my own.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.280
So you can branch off at any time.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.340
It's a very flexible system that gives you total flexibility.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:53.120
And at the same time, to me, the big differentiation is that the speed aspect to it, the fact that downloading images is much faster because images are layered.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:13:00.160
And starting a container is like 10 times or maybe 100 times faster, depending on the cases.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.660
When you make things faster, usually it changes the experience.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:10.100
And that's what developers found or realized when they start.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.920
When a developer starts to use Docker, usually they have this aha moment.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:26.600
Oh, then I can build all the time and create my own images and start breaking my application that was monolithic into smaller microservices that are easier to compose with something like Docker Compose.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:36.800
So it goes hand in hand with two big shifts in software engineering that happened in the past five years.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.640
One of them is microservices.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:47.540
One of them is microservices, the fact of breaking up your application into smaller services that can be scaled and developed independently.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:14:04.380
And the other one is DevOps, where dev teams and ops teams are working together with continuous integration and continuous delivery using the same tools to achieve continuous delivery of their application.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.480
And so the container is a really nice unit of collaboration between devs and ops.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:16.120
I think you're right that the size makes that really even possible to some degree.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.260
So let me give you my mental model for the DevOps story.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.460
And maybe you can tell me how I have that slightly wrong or improve on it or whatever.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:35.380
So in my mind, I'm thinking there's some developers building their app and probably they have some kind of continuous integration set up where they check in, some automated build happens, some test run, stuff like that.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.520
So I could build instead of just running my code directly, checking in and running my test directly on the, say, the build server.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.920
I could create a container.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:52.560
And when I do a check in, the build server could actually create one of these containers, push my code into it, run that code in that actual container environment.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.580
And if I'm happy, maybe I could automatically push that out to some cloud provider.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.620
And the thing that's actually running is the thing I tested and built locally.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.660
Yeah.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.000
So there's no sort of environmental differences or anything like that.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.140
It's just that is the thing.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.440
I can actually ship almost the infrastructure.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:11.980
Yeah.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.640
I think you got it right.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:31.080
One of the things I would add is that this kind of factoring out of applications into microservices works really well for people who follow the 12-factor app manifesto that Heroku published a few years ago

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.080
where you try to build your apps as stateless as possible.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.840
You run data services in a centralized way.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:47.160
And then you configure the connectivity between different microservices with environment variables.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:57.600
And so typically what would happen is that you would run locally as a developer on a single box with a test MySQL container

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.420
that has a volume attached with test data in there.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:13.700
And then when you just got pushed to a build server, the build server deploys that into a cloud QA environment where automated tests are deployed.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:21.600
And then there the container would be tied to a test MySQL database that maybe is maintained by operations.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:31.340
So this is where the split between dev and operations happens where the devs specify all the requirements that they have for their app in the container.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:36.600
And then the ops are providing the right plugs to the right services in different environments.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:50.880
And then eventually you would push that to production where typically there would be someone, a sysadmin, that would decide, hey, this build is ready to go to production.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:56.720
I'm just going to trigger the fact that in production the image is going to be pulled.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.120
It's the same image that I had on my dev box.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.780
But there it's configured to go to my production MySQL cluster.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.220
That's really amazing.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.220
So how do I deal with persistent data?

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.800
You know, I've got this.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:18.900
Let's say I create one of these Docker containers that contains like MongoDB.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.060
MongoDB has to have a data store somewhere on the file system.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.000
How do I kind of deal with inversion that?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.600
Is that actually in the container?

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.560
Is that somewhere else?

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:34.600
How do I, you know, if the database schema changes as the new container comes up, what do I do?

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.860
That seems a little tricky.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:36.840
Definitely.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:47.480
So Docker has this notion of values where in your container you can mount a directory that is on your host machine.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.880
And this is where you would keep the data.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:18:00.820
And typically there's also another notion that is called a data container where you just launch a container that just has a volume attached to it.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.280
And then you mount the volumes from that container into your runtime container.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:18.200
And then changing database like from development to production would just be a matter of changing the volume of the container you're mounting your volume from.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.860
So that's the notion of volume that lets you have persistent containers.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:41.080
There's one issue with it in Docker today that lots of people are running into when they try to deploy in clusters, which is volumes can be attached only for local file systems, on the engine on which you are triggered, on the host on which you are triggered.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:49.920
And there's a company called cluster HQ, which is building an add-on to Docker called Fluckr.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.540
We're working with them to make it a plugin, like a real plugin in Docker.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.240
So there's work underway to make that happen right now.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:06.420
And what Fluckr is doing is that they're addressing this issue of moving persistent container from one host to another.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:20.540
If you're deploying in a large orchestrated Docker setup, where when the orchestrator tells the engine, hey, I want to move that Docker engine that is tied to your,

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:31.200
Docker container that has a persistent volume from host A to host B, what they're doing is that they're using ZFS under the hood,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.580
and they're doing a ZFS snapshot, which are pretty fast.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.160
Then they're moving the snapshot to the other machine that can take a few hours.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:47.180
And once the snapshot is moved, they can start your server, take a diff of the snapshot and push it on the other side, which is faster.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.860
And then they restart your container on the other side.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.780
That sounds really helpful because it seems like there's a lot of complexity, more and more containers that get involved,

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.540
a more horizontal scale that gets in there.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:56.840
Yeah.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.380
Yeah.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:05.480
Container persistence is really an interesting issue where there's lots of research right now and lots of companies looking into that and how to enable this.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.400
Excellent.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.660
So you've spoken a little bit about Docker Hub.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.740
Can you tell the listeners what that is?

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.500
Yeah, definitely.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:19.420
So Docker itself is a client and a demon that's running either on your local machine or on your server.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:26.980
But what you're building with the Docker client is an image of the system on which you're running.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:32.880
Once your image is ready, typically you would push it to Docker Hub, which is a hosted service by Docker.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.540
So it's software as a service.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:40.820
It's a hosted service that Docker, that lets you share your images either with the world.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.480
You can make your image public.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:42.780
You can make your image public.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.720
And there are lots of open source and community images in there.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.200
Or you can host them privately.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.700
So Docker Hub is free for public images.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:21:02.860
But if you want a private image, you can buy a subscription that allows you to have several private images for your own projects.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:08.000
And then your colleague can just download the images from the hub as well.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.120
And it's integrated with Docker client.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.240
We also have a version that's called Docker Hub Enterprise.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:20.160
That enterprises who want to adopt Docker for their internal workflow can install behind the firewall.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.080
So they have complete control over the policies for the images that they're creating.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.820
Right.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.440
That makes sense.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.840
You might not want to just go grab a bunch of public images and download them.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.640
Is this actual source code or actual binary executables that I'm grabbing?

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.760
Or is there another way to get an image from Docker Hub?

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:53.080
So what you grab from Docker Hub, these images are actually tables that are gzip for each of the layers with a bunch of metadata explaining the Docker Engine how to reconstitute the image of your operating system.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.180
Okay, excellent.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:58.860
So it might tell me how to install Nginx or how to install Python 3 or something like that.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.420
Yeah, exactly.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:05.900
So we host official Docker images for many open source projects.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.640
So for example, for Python, there's an excellent...

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.260
I used to take images from the community initially.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.080
And then I switched to the official image, which is called Python.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:22.040
And so in order to run Python in Docker, you just say Docker run Python.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.260
Eventually, you could qualify that to say if you want Python 2 or Python 3.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:34.760
Or there are labels on these images that let you specify a more fine-grained version of Python.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:40.020
And once you run the image, it comes with a...

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.940
I don't remember which flavor of Linux.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:49.480
And then Python all installed with the tools for developing there or for running Python workloads.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.720
That sounds like a really easy way to get started for the Python developers.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.180
That's cool.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.860
Yeah, and that's one of the things that I love.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.100
So I joined Docker just two months ago.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:08.420
Before that, I was at Microsoft where my role as part of the developer experience team

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.980
was to bring all the Docker partner ecosystem on Azure.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:19.660
And so as part of doing that, I built a bunch of tools to deploy clusters on Azure.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.540
And the tool I built for that was in Python.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.400
And I interacted with lots of startups using Python.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:32.460
And when I started talking about my tools to other Microsoft people and I started giving trainings about that,

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.060
these guys were on Windows.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.060
They didn't have Python installed.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.260
They said, how do I run that script?

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:45.260
And in order to make that easier, I just bundled all my script in a Docker image.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:51.280
And I just told them, hey, you just run that image and you'll have Python 2 installed,

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:57.700
all the requirements for the tool that I built, like the Azure Python SDK, all pre-installed.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.760
And you don't need to install anything.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.700
It's just a Docker run away from running.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.060
That's really cool.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.440
It sounds like an interesting world to live in, working with a lot of the Windows stuff.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:15.900
And actually, one of the things I'd kind of like to talk about in a minute is the Docker view from different operating systems.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.480
I mean, if I'm on Linux, it makes perfect sense.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.800
It's kind of like a Linux thing.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.900
I can run Docker right on Ubuntu, things like that.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.160
Yeah.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.360
But if I'm on, say, let's say, on my Mac, what do I do there?

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.960
Yeah, so on a Mac, you can download an installer from docker.com.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:37.740
So we always release all our versions on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:47.360
And so you download that installer and what it's doing because the engine relies on primitives in the Linux kernel.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.840
It needs to run on Linux.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.840
And so we have this tool that's downloaded as part of the installer that's called Boot2Docker

00:24:53.840 --> 00:25:01.040
that starts behind the scene a VirtualBox VM running Linux where the engine is installed.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.480
And then you run the client on your Mac, and your client is targeting that VirtualBox instance.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:15.340
And then by changing the environment variables, you can just target, instead of targeting your local machine,

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:24.560
your local VirtualBox instance on your Mac, you can target a box in Azure or Google Compute Engine or Amazon.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.220
So that's pretty easy.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.580
Yeah, in terms of operating system, one of the things that I'm super happy about that happened,

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:37.300
that was launched a few weeks ago and that was announced at the build,

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:44.220
conference last week from Microsoft, that Microsoft really bet heavily on Docker.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:52.620
And what they've done is that they have contributed a lot of code to Docker so that now the Docker client runs on Windows.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.440
So you can run the Docker client and then target Linux machines.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.860
You can use Boot2Docker on Windows as well.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.980
So you can run your Linux workloads on Windows with that and develop.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.780
That's cool.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.920
So that kind of puts it on par with OS X maybe.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.500
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.260
Puts it on par with OS X.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:20.080
But they're going to run the Docker client.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:30.820
So that's cool.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.680
So that's really a big news.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:43.280
So Microsoft likes the Docker workflow for devs and ops so much that they wanted to give that to Windows developers and Windows sysadmins.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:50.420
So they modified Windows server to have the same isolation primitive that exists in Linux.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.860
And then they implemented the Docker daemon in terms of that.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.020
So that's not out yet.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.080
They just gave a demo last week.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.320
But it's going to shift with the next version of Windows server.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.720
And there will be a preview this summer.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:13.480
So that means that you'll be able to develop .NET applications running on Windows server inside of Docker containers.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:21.700
Which means that for developers and sysadmins in enterprise who are typically working half and half with Java and .NET,

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:30.040
they'll be able to just deploy or to build their microservices in the technology that fits the best.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.000
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.960
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.440
I was watching the Build conference last week as well.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.140
And just for the listeners, because of time shifting, we're recording on Monday, May 4th.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.980
And Build, I think this was announced last Wednesday, so four or five days ago.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:54.780
And one of the very first things they announced at the entire conference was your CEO, Ben Golub, coming out and saying, you know, from Docker, saying,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.860
look, we're working with Microsoft doing amazing things.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.120
And we started out maybe trying to bring it on par with OS X.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:07.480
But the Microsoft guys wanted to go even farther and actually add features to Windows, the OS,

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.860
that would allow it to have containers for its operating system and its processes.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:17.220
Because until this moment, there was no possibility of something like Docker on Windows for Windows apps.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.160
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty incredible.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:28.440
So, I mean, to me, that means like now we have the two major operating systems that run software and the servers in the data centers,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.080
both supporting containers, both working with Docker.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.660
And that's a huge boost for you guys, right?

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.580
Yeah, yeah, it is.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.600
It is definitely.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:45.580
And I think it's very good for the Windows ecosystem as well, because it will bring them the same kind of tools that Linux developers and admins have been enjoying for a long time.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:51.040
And it really allows for more dense workloads on your servers and in the data center.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.200
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.720
So the DevOps story just gets way better over there, I think.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.460
Yeah, exactly.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:58.460
So I'd like to talk a little bit about Python with you.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.700
But before we do, what do you think the future holds for Docker and containers?

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.060
Where are things going in this whole world?

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:09.580
Yeah, so we have DockerCon, which is our big conference that's happening in June.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:20.600
And one of the things we've been working on, as I explained to you before, Docker takes care of a lot of aspects, but it still needs to mature in lots of areas.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:27.960
And especially when people start putting it in production, there are lots of needs that are still unfulfilled by the tool.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:33.040
So one of the big aspects that we've been working on recently is to make it pluggable.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:43.580
So we're working on a plugin model with people like Weave, who are building virtual networking, or ClusterHQ, who are building portable volumes,

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:57.120
so that they can run as plugin in Docker Engine, and so that you would be able to define networks for your containers that span your own data center,

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:02.020
and maybe Azure and Google, or like two public clouds.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:08.200
So that's on the Weave side, and on the ClusterHQ side, it's like moving volumes from one to the other.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:14.820
We're also working on making sure Docker Machine lets you provision Docker daemons everywhere.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.140
There's been lots of improvement to Docker Compose.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:26.940
And also, one of the big topics that's happening right now is once you start building all your apps as microservices running in containers,

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.740
the next step is how do you orchestrate them?

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:38.760
And I have a whole deck on that that I'd send you where there's at least six or seven containers in that space.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.920
Again, as I used to say, the whole industry reorganized around this.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:53.960
Before, people were building platforms as a service, and that whole industry refocused towards orchestrating Docker containers.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.600
So the unit now is the microservice package as a container.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:04.300
And in the orchestrators, you have Docker Swarm, which is one from Docker itself.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.900
So it's a native orchestration solution that works multi-cloud.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:15.140
There's Kubernetes from Google that's inspired by what's running internally at Google, and that's open source.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.900
There's Apache Mesos, done by Mesosphere.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.740
And they're running in production in lots of different places.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.540
They're coming from Twitter originally.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.720
I think Netflix runs it as well.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:34.080
And there are smaller players like DS or Tutum, which is running on Azure as well.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.960
So there's lots of activity in that space of our Docker container orchestration.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.560
Yeah, that seems like where the real challenges lie.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.760
And if that gets easier and easier, then, you know, the sky's the limit.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.640
So that's amazing.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:52.060
Yeah, on the Docker side, we're trying to make the whole experience easier, like with machines,

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.340
like one command to provision new machines in different clouds.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.080
And then it's integrated with Swarm.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.720
So you can say, oh, I want all these machines to be in a single cluster.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:08.120
And then with Docker Compose, you can say, oh, I want to, or there's the start of an integration

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:14.140
where you can say, my app that's composed of multiple services, please deploy that to that Swarm instance.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:19.240
And then it will just provision it in the right place in the cluster where there's some room.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:24.780
So we're really trying to make the experience much easier for developers and sysadmins.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:25.260
Cool.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:25.500
Yeah.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:30.800
The more you guys encourage and make it easy to break our apps into small little services,

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.140
then the challenge becomes linking them together, right?

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.500
So it sounds like you're doing some great work there.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:35.960
Fantastic.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.200
Yeah.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:42.020
And one advantage I will have to add that there is to this microservice approach and that Docker enables

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:51.420
is once you start breaking your app in microservices, you can start innovating in terms of what language

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.140
and platform you're using for each of the microservice.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:33:02.240
So as opposed to being stuck, for example, with a Django app running in Python 2.7 and you made that choice

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:10.040
and there's some legacy code that cannot be ported to Python 3, you could say, oh, I just break my app in 10 different microservices

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.540
and for this microservice, I don't have any legacy.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.260
I'm going to write it in Python 3.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:25.760
And for the developers, it's just a matter of saying, oh, I'm inheriting from Python 3 as opposed to Python 2 when you're creating your image.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.980
Oh, that's really neat.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.540
So maybe it's a gateway for a little more flexibility in the technology to...

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:31.760
Yeah.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:40.520
And I think especially for the Python community where that big gap between Python 2 and Python 3 developers happen,

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:49.020
I think this breaking up of large monolithic applications into smaller microservices where you have more freedom to test new stuff

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.060
may be a good way of introducing Python 3 to your environment.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:53.720
For sure.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.420
Do you see anything like that happening in the data side of things?

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:02.500
So, you know, if I'm using MySQL and relational databases in some big monolithic way,

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:09.060
like, could my different microservices be using, like, NoSQL, say, MongoDB or Redis here and there,

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.500
and then maybe one other part still using a relational database?

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:12.900
Oh, yeah.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.980
I've seen a lot of that where people are starting...

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.700
Once your microservices...

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:23.700
Your microservice has a smaller footprint and, like, a single functional goal,

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:28.660
then it's easier to say, oh, I'm going to back that up with Redis or MongoDB

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.960
as opposed to storing everything in MySQL

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:40.000
because maybe I'm building an e-commerce application and I need the relational aspect for parts of it,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:51.380
but maybe for, like, tracking referrals or the social media aspect of how people are tweeting about products on my website,

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:57.800
maybe these small services can use different types of databases or data backends.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.920
Yeah, that seems like a perfect way to choose the right database, the right job there.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.700
Cool.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.260
So you guys, do you use Python internally?

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.840
You know, obviously you can run Python in Docker containers really well,

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.920
but do you guys use it as a language for yourself?

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.980
Actually, we do.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.160
Not everybody.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.460
So Docker itself is written in Go as well as Docker Machine and Swarm.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:26.020
But Docker Compose is actually written in Python, so it's a Python project.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:26.380
Nice.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:26.880
And how's that?

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.980
People are pretty happy with Python internally?

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:33.600
Yeah, and I think they even tried to call it to Go at some point,

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.340
but then they said, hey, we have high velocity with Python,

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:42.000
we have a code base that people understand well, so let's stick with that.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.460
So I think Compose for now will stay in Python,

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:49.180
and the developers who are working on it are pretty happy with it.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.260
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.120
So if, you know, I'm a listener and I'm out there hearing this,

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.260
and I'm like, this is awesome, I have to get started.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:56.880
What do I do?

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.600
How do I get started?

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.880
Yeah, to get started, you go to docker.com.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.300
We have lots of tutorials.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.860
If you're on a Mac, you just download Docker for Mac, for Linux.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.980
Depending on the distro, either there are packages

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.080
or you can download the binaries directly.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.760
And for Windows, there's an installer as well.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.440
There's also another project you may want to take a look at,

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.500
that's called Ketmatic.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:25.380
That one runs only on macOS, and it's a Docker client GUI.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:30.600
So it shows you all the containers that you can find on Docker Hub,

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.620
and you can say, oh, just start this one,

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.600
launch a terminal where I can script it or connect to it,

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:41.000
and it shows you the logs, the volume that you have attached,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.180
so you can go edit the files and all that.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:48.140
So that's a very easy way to get started, Ketmatic, I would say.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.260
And else?

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.780
Yeah, I have Ketmatic installed, and I enjoy it.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:52.160
It's nice.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.800
It's clean and works well.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.740
Yeah, there's lots of stuff to add in there,

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.320
but it's really a good start, and it's very easy to get started.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.020
Excellent.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.000
So I think it's probably a place to call it a show, Patrick.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.720
What else would you like to add while we've got a chance to talk to everyone?

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.820
I mean, thanks very much for the opportunity.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:16.400
I really encourage Python developers to go take a look at that.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.940
To me, one of the angles that's most interesting for Python developers

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:26.560
is giving you the portability for your customers to run your code anywhere

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.680
without having a complicated environment to set up.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:36.020
As long as they have Docker, they can just start your app packaged as a container.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.360
And the other angle that's, I think, pretty important

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:44.660
is starting to introduce Python 3 microservices into your app.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.960
If all your apps are packaged as containers, it just doesn't matter.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.940
You don't need to set up complicated environments.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:38:00.380
It's just a change of the label in the from directive in your Docker file

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.180
to start using Python 3.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.220
I am very excited about Docker and this whole container world.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.920
And I appreciate you taking the time to share it with everyone.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.560
Thanks, Michael.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.360
You're welcome, Patrick.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.080
Bye.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:12.640
Bye.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.880
