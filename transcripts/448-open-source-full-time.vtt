WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
So you've created a Python based open source project and it's starting to take off

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:12.280
You're getting contributors lots of buzz in the podcast space and more but you have that day job working on Java still

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.100
How do you make that transition from popular hobby project to a full-time job?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.400
After all you're giving away your open source project for free, right?

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.020
Well on this episode I put together an amazing panel of guests who all have done exactly this

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.400
Turn their project into full-time work and even companies in some cases

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.720
We have Samuel Colvin Gina Huska Sebastian Ramirez

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.420

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.840
Charlie will Eric Sebastian Gina and Samuel what a big group of people we have here today an awesome awesome group

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.640
Thanks for being here everyone. It's gonna be super fun to have you on the show

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.200
You know

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.380
I know there's so many people out there that are

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.240
Dreaming of an open-source project or even working on open source and contributing to it

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.820
But it's something they squeeze in the last hour of their day and at some point all of you have made this

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.960
Amazing transition to where there's enough support

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.720
There's enough interest in what you all built that becomes your full-time thing

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.920
Right, which is I know for many out there live in the dream. So you all are living the dream. I'm

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.040
Hopefully you feel that way

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.640
But it's gonna be really great to kind of just explore your projects

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.800
How do you make that transition and you know what you're up to?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.780
So we have Samuel Colvin on from Pydantic and he has the tightest schedule

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.240
He's squeezing us in on a far-flung trip work trip. So let's go to you first Samuel

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.000
Just you know, tell people a bit about who you are and what your project is to get started. Yeah, I'm Samuel

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.640
I maintain Pydantic which is a data validation library for Python that uses pipelinks

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.720
So those weird things you've seen after the colon in Python that mostly do nothing unless you run mypy or pywrite

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.320
Pydantic basically enforces them. Almost exactly a year ago

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.440
I was I was sort of working on Pydantic full-time by then

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.000
but really spending my own money to do so and a big American VC got in touch and

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.120
Fast forward I raised some money and started a company

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.600
Yeah, beginning of this year. I hired now 10 people and I'm actually as you mentioned

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.360
I'm in Istanbul at the moment with the whole team

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.360
It turns out if you have a team with Americans, Iranians and Russians

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.080
That Istanbul is one of the few places that you can actually meet officially

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.640
So yeah, we're having a really fun week in Istanbul mostly working together and then going out for dinner

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.780
Which is where we are at the moment. I hope that's a good fix. Absolutely

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.040
And what a cool experience that you get to hang out with all these people talking about your project in Istanbul

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.040
I just had by the way, I just had

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.440
I mean just think the other thing I would add is one of the best bits of it has been being able to hire

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.280
friends of mine from open source people who had I think all but two of the people here have

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.240
contributed to Pydantic before we started the company which is how I

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.980
Yeah

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.960
hired the first I think six people and then a few more so one of the best bits has been hiring other people to come

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.580
and work on open source with me while still being able to like, yeah, pay them properly. It's been really fun

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.700
Yeah, awesome. I see a lot of people shaking their head out there as well

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.160
I just coincidentally I recently had Sydney Runkle on

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.400
Who works with you and she's such an inspiration that show is not out yet

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.820
But has already been done yet through the weird time shifting of podcasting

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.600
So it'll be out before this but it's not out yet. So anyway, very very cool team you got there

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.540
I guess we'll go around the order of the the video

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.380
Pretty bunch pictures here. So Charlie, you're up next

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.580
Hey, so I'm Charlie

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:04.180
I am the author of rough which is a Python linter code formatter and code transformation tool written in rust

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:11.100
I started started working on rough about a year ago. Like maybe like October last year similar time frame to Samuel

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.500
Yeah, yeah, and I worked on it full-time for a while

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.560
Similar to Samuel although probably not for quite quite as long

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.400
I was working on it full-time without any funding and then

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:27.400
Similarly, I started a company around around rough and really around the vision of trying to build high-performance Python tools

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.740
So take some of the things that make rough nice to use and popular and well liked and try to apply those

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.320
Principles to other parts of the the Python toolchain. Yeah, we're a team of six and

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.780
We're fully remote. So no two of us live in the same in the same place

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.780
I guess a couple of us live in the same country, but

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.920
Those those live in different countries. Yeah, and we span basically us central time - I don't know

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.220
What we have one we have one person in in India and one person in Minneapolis

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.140
And that kind of stretches like the full-time says the team that's a good stretch. It's good stretch there

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:08.780
Well, yeah, absolutely. Congratulations on rough. It is really really taken off and I know the guy right below you and

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.420
Where's Sebastian was I saw him saying nice things about it with FastAPI and so on. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Thanks a lot

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.260
It's just funny because I think I was saying before I started recording

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.060
I think when I came on talk Python last time

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.220
I think that might have been my first time ever on a podcast

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.940
So and it was to talk about rough and so I was like, oh wow people care about what I'm doing

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.020
That's super cool and pydantic and FastAPI were some of the earliest

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.620
Adopters that people had heard of so they were like very early on in the in the life cycle and helped a lot with

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.900
You know getting people to see rough and sort of care about rough and and know that smart people are using it

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:54.220
That's awesome. Well when you visit talk Python or the courses website or others, it's it's all rough fide

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.240
I don't know what the the adjective of rough is but it's been rough

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.500
It's been roughed up and it works great it's really amazing that makes the code sound really bad

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.220
It's like saying it's sick like oh that was a sick trick they did it mean

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:18.120
Yeah, that code is a rough man. All right. Well, it's your code rough. Who are you? It's got some rough edges certainly

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.260
Welcome. Yeah, I'm well

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.060
I'm probably best known for a library called rich and rich is a library for writing

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:32.160
Formatted content in terminal and you can write put tables and progress bars and syntax how I did code all sorts of things

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.020
And then that became quite popular in the Python the world

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.940
I think there was a there was a need for it and two years ago. I founded text allies

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:48.100
Which the company which builds on rich to produce a library called text Joe which allows you to build user interfaces

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:54.720
Inside terminal and these are kind of more like web interfaces and less like courses application

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.620
Yeah, I was just think almost like flexbox you can dock stuff to the side and that's part of a UI

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:06.120
But it's it's pretty amazing what you've built. Yeah, I think it's pushed the terminal far beyond what many people thought the terminal should be doing

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.580
It's been very cool. It's been a process of discovery. It's kind of strange

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:17.500
You've got technology that's been around for for decades and still discovering things like they can do which and people haven't tried before

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.100
So yeah, it's been a lot of fun and it's been great to work with a small team of developers

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.740
We've got a small core here in Edinburgh Scotland and we got one developer in Portugal

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:34.140
So yeah, it's it's it's been great and I love the reception and love what people are building with it. Yeah, it's so many people are

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.500
Interested in using rich and there's a ton of plugins, right?

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.460
There's like rich click and there's py test rich and all these things like well, whatever we're doing

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.340
It should also have what you built, you know, yeah, I love to see that

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.820
I love to see the ecosystem building our our adjective is richified which is not richified. Okay

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:57.060
Yeah, just you know, that's rich. My code is rich. Okay, richified. Got it. I love it

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:02.620
We all have adjectives. We got to put on things. Yeah, I'm a big fan of your your you and your team's work

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.180
By the way, I mean, I'm sure you hear all the time that you built awesome stuff. Cheers. Appreciate it

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.420
Yeah, indeed. We all are Eric. Welcome. You and I are

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:15.940
Coming in somewhat local here out of Portland not Istanbul. I'm actually out in Bend at the moment

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.140
So yeah, I absolutely love Ben's lots of mountains and whatnot

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.080
But yeah, so my background mariculture folks probably know me from kind of the read the docs ecosystem

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.220
I feel like I've been doing this for a while compared to everyone else here

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:34.360
The project actually started in 2010, which is kind of amazing and then we actually built the started the company around it in 2014

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:40.100
So coming up next year, that'll be 10 years. And so yeah, and we're all bootstrapped. So we haven't done any venture capital

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.680
It's all been kind of just build it built up the open source and then kind of turned it into a company on top

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.860
Of that we kind of have a business model of doing paid for private hosting

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.460
You know companies as well as advertising on open source

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.780
And we spun out a kind of a separate business called ethical ads that we built kind of to basically make you know

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.780
Better advertising on the internet not doing any of the creepy tracking stuff

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:06.020
So read the docs is so critical to the open source space not just Python, but especially Python. Yeah

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.960
Yeah, I mean so awesome work on that and then just you know, good job on the ad stuff as well

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:18.580
It's the tendency of the whole ad space is to be super creepy and just like how much can we resell and how much can?

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:23.300
We buy to mix in to like create these shadow profiles and it's not a good social trend

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.620
It's it's not good for people and it's not really necessary

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.420
Right, like if I want to you know

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:33.420
I've sponsored ads on read the docs or had run ads on read the docs before and we had a flask course and let's just

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.420
you know run that ad on

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.740
Flask instead of like let's see we can track somebody through Instagram over to Facebook who knew

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:48.260
We call it a newspaper advertising and it's been really cool with the advances of ML like the content targeting has gotten pretty good

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:53.060
Right, so it it's definitely a lot easier technically these days to to kind of do that content matching

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.060
But yeah, I think in terms of the kind of open source

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.620
Maybe the way that I'm a little different than other folks here is we're actually running something more akin to a service

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:04.740
So read the docs all the code is open source, but a lot of the usage is open source projects using our hosted service

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.540
We do obviously ship a lot of code

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.860
Probably our Sphinx theme is is probably the most kind of well-known

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:15.420
Actual software that people are running a little bit similar to the folks here the kind of sidebar on the left and and yeah

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.220
So I think that's kind of the background is yeah, we have a little bit of everything

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.740
But yeah, it's a little more akin to something like a sass app I would say but the code is all open source

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.580
We do get a contribution in that way as well. Yeah, awesome

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.580
And you know sounds a little similar to what textualize is working towards as well hosting

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.580
I mean, it's more hosting people's apps then

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:38.700
Hosting people's docs but not terribly different paying for services is a classic open source monetization strategy, right?

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.140
Like you have some way to kind of build the monetization on top

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.020
So yeah, it's like what you build is great, but it's kind of hard for me to run

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.420
Could you just do that? Like yeah, sure we can do that Sebastian always good to see you. Welcome back

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:54.060
Thank you very much for having me. Hello everyone. So I was in Ramirez or the envelope. I created this

00:11:54.060 --> 00:12:01.780
Little tool for building web API that is called FastAPI and it has been growing quite a bit people have lighted

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:08.660
Fortunately and like yeah, that's it. I'm probably the only one that hasn't built a company here. I guess

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.420
Okay

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.900
There are two of us nice I wanna hear that. Okay

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:21.980
So this year I have been able to work full-time on open source because Sequoia capital the VC firm started this open source

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:27.980
Fellowship and I am the first fellow so I am kind of the test trial of like the program

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.500
So I get you know, like just to work full-time on open source and that's how I've been able to just yeah

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.860
It is have one job stuff in FastAPI and the ecosystem like the other libraries FastAPI

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:42.540
SQL model type and a couple of other things. But yeah, that's pretty much it. Yeah, awesome

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.100
Well FastAPI is definitely the poster child for modern

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:52.900
Python on the web, you know and Samuel's work obviously is central to that as well

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.820
Right with Pydantic being such a core element there. So very awesome

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.540
Yeah, like I mean FastAPI is built on top of like great open source tools and their needs

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:08.220
So by Dante does all the data validation service in documentation and on the other side startlet does all the web parts

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.500
So yeah, it's like unlike, you know, like it's a very close. How do you call it like?

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.700
Close friendship between all the projects by Dante's tablets

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.140
You become FastAPI like, you know

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:23.540
Like we actually know each by this point actually know each other in person like the current

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.460
container of started on you because works for the Pydantic company

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:34.660
Yeah, I mean he's like the top FastAPI experts right now like, you know, like it's it's a it's very nice because helps the

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.960
Dynam the dynamism of like yes, absolutely building stuff. It's great

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:46.860
Yeah, I imagine a lot of people don't realize the interconnections between these different projects that are at play here

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.620
Yeah, it's definitely super fun. Absolutely

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.620
And then it's worth saying we in Pydantic use FastAPI as well as contributing to the libraries that don't it

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.900
We also use FastAPI for the services that we're building

00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.860
So we're like consumers both directly and indirectly of the things that we maintain in open source

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.380
Awesome chat quite often special. So it's all it's turtles all the way down basically exactly

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.820
This portion of talk Python me is brought to you by base -

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:15.420
Base - is the custom admin panel for your database that you don't have to build

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:22.660
We've all dealt with endless ad hoc requests for data access your support team wants user records your non-technical

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.460
Co-founder needs to see charts or your engineering team needs an easy way to share your SQL queries

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.020
These all sound like relatively simple tasks

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.120
But between building an internal tool

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.460
Setting up an analytics product and then switching back and forth between that and your SQL client

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:45.940
You've lost so much time base - gives you that time back with base - you can instantly generate a

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.060
Visual UI for your database. All you have to do is connect your data source

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:54.860
It uses AI under the hood to generate the perfect admin panel for your data

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.380
Voila now anyone in your company has access to the data they need

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:04.700
They're rolling out a ton of new features like the ability to create charts using only natural language

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:11.220
You're gonna get hours back in your day, and I promise you won't want to build an internal tool ever again

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:17.300

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:35.700
Gina also awesome to have you back. They'll come in very happy to be back. That's really really great to be here now

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.020
I think for the second time so and assert if we call fight invites

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.980
So yeah, my name is Gina high school and I'm probably yeah

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.620
I don't know if I'm if I'm that well known throughout the Python community

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.540
But I'm quite well known in the 3d printing community for having created octoprint

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.700
which is the snappy web interface for you 3d printer and

00:15:53.700 --> 00:16:00.780
The server part of that is all written in Python and I started a project back in 2012 when I got my first 3d printer

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:05.540
As your regular pet project on the side after hours vacation blah blah blah in

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:10.980
2014 I got hired by a 3d printing company to work on it full-time and in

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:19.460
2016 that company ran out of money and I suddenly found myself with a full-fledged full-grown open source project and no funding

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:27.540
Whatsoever, so I tried this whole crowdfunding stuff with patreon and that is pretty much how I've been working ever since so I'm

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.340
Self-employed under German law. I'm a freelancer and

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:38.100
Yeah, all my income comes from people who just sent me money for working on octoprint

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.540
And did you say since 2016 since 2016? Yeah. Okay, cool

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:49.860
So full-time since 2014 and self-employed and crowdfunded since 2016, so it's been a while. That's awesome

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:55.140
I also went full-time on all my stuff here at 2016, although it's technically not open source

00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.220
It talks a whole lot about open source stuff. So totally awesome. It that's it's been a while. Congratulations. Thank you

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.340
I'm still surprised it works to be honest. I'm

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.700
Waiting every day that it stops working and yeah

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.700
Actually this year it came a bit close and then I put out like a blog post basically along the lines of you know

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:16.580
Like the income is going this but the usage numbers are going that so something is a mishear and we need to talk and then

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:23.060
The community rallied and stuff fixed itself again. So that is pretty amazing. That's really awesome. Congratulations

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.180
It's easy for people just go. Oh, it's free

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:32.260
And there's some people supporting it and just kind of assume that things are taken care of it. Yeah. Yeah, really good. Really good

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.580
Yeah, you have a ton of supporters on

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:41.580
GitHub sponsors as well, right actually after the fight over the years and in the beginning it was only patreon and paypal and then I

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.900
started adding new

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.980
payment platforms and options because people

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:50.760
Prefer to be able to use the stuff that they know and some people don't like patreon some people don't like on what don't know

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.420
It's up sponsors and stuff

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:58.380
And so you just give them the options to choose whatever they feel comfortable with and this increases the likelihood that they actually

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.880
Will go through with throwing something in your head. So to speak. Yeah, at least that's my feeling. I don't know

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.340
I think the github sponsors has been really positive for open source tickets

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.600
It's made it pretty easy to just check a box

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.860
They already have your credit card potentially and you just want to give a little support instead of you know

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:20.580
One time PayPal donation here that you forget about after once and and all that before we move on here

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.840
There's a funny comment nice comment out and Kanishka says

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.360
The this group look at all of you you guys are the Avengers of Python open source, right?

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.060
Which is kind of like the superheroes. I love it. It's somewhat actually true. It seems okay

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.720
So the next thing I want to ask is a little bit of an origin story

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.380
Just what projects did you try and they didn't really get traction and then you know

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:47.720
How do you think that your project got traction here? And I know Samuel you might vanish any minute. So you're next

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.480
You're up first on this one. That's a really thing. I feel a number of things about this also

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.680
I started something last last week

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:59.120
I ever saw some Friday that has got more stars over the last three days or I guess week now as

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:04.020
The first project I started a rq2 has over it coming up on six years

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:12.120
So I mean that's front-end and front-end gets a lot more attractions and then like queuing and RPC does but yeah

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.900
I don't know how like obviously there were some things I played with back then and then it took off

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.520
But yeah, it was this like I think I was the right time right place for Titans

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.360
They don't have been around the Titan for a long time

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.880
But back in 2017 when I started I'd answer it

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.840
Their usage was going really fast and I think there were lots of people I read you found it kind of frustrating that they were

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:35.080
There anything so yeah, I think being the right time right place was super valuable for me and obviously

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:41.560
Like great projects like FastAPI adopting adopting financing. It made a big difference, but I don't know

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.560
What's weird if you look at the download chart?

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.120
It's like this is actually quite at the beginning of 20 21

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:53.180
So then we had like five million downloads a month and since then has been kind of almost exactly linear growth to now

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.020
125 million down this month something weird happened in 2021

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.100
Longer after the project started. I don't know. Yeah, I think it was right place right time

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:06.260
And that's frustration was the starting point on that. No, I'm gonna have to rush guys

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.800
But it's great to see everyone and I'm sure I mean you all in the conference in bye-bye. Thanks for dropping in

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.440
Good to see ya. All right, Charlie keep going around the circle here. Just it so I don't know

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:21.120
Yeah, you know, it's interesting because I like this rough is really my first time

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:28.960
Being a maintainer like publishing open really like I've been a consumer of open source, right for my whole career

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.180
But I was never really a I guess in the creator or a publisher or a maintainer of open source, you know around the time

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.120
That I started working on rough

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.180
I was working on like a couple different projects and they all I was kind of trying to figure out what I wanted to do

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:46.000
Next I'd left my job recently and and rough was kind of motivated by a lot of the experiences

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.800
I had at my job where I was like maintaining a large Python code base

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.840
Did you leave your job with the intent of going to work on rough?

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.060
Are we just like I'm gonna leave and then I'm gonna figure something out and kind of like well

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.160
What is the process that I left my job with the intent of starting a company?

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.760
But I did not think it would be rough and rough was like this

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.840
Distracting side project that I was working on while I was like I was working with a friend and we were like

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:14.080
Trying to figure out like the Venn diagram of interests of like what should we what are we willing to work on full-time together?

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.840
What makes sense given like our interests and and then you know my free time

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.400
I was like, I just want to work on developer tools and like I worked on I built I built rough

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.800
I started building rough. I worked on like, you know, we're done a lot of different

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.360
Oh, not a lot. But like I did we're gonna couple different projects

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.760
I did like a sort of CI CD thing where you like write docker files and like

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.720
CI files in TypeScript and they like transpiled down and I was I was like

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:44.600
I think that has a lot of cool ideas. I worked on like it was pretty early in a lot of the LLM stuff

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.600
I worked on like a code base wide

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.440
Refactoring tool where you like give it examples of like before and after and that tries to find example

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.560
It was like a copilot for your entire code base kind of it didn't work that well like that scale

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.560
But it was like a cool idea. So I was like working on the stuff. There's all open source

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.520
That maybe could have been a timing thing like maybe today that would be all the all the

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.240
It's also like and yeah, it's also an effort thing

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:12.360
I guess like I I put a lot more into rough and it was interesting because I kept viewing rough is like, you know

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.640
It was probably open source by at that point

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.360
I don't think I had launched like launched it and I kept viewing it as like like I said like a little bit of a

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.520
distraction and my friend was like, you know

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.520
I think you should really like push to like

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.460
Release this because like if you think it's like interesting then like other people will probably think it's interesting and he was the person

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.240
that really like

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:36.000
Motivated me to actually like see it through to doing the release and then I did the release and like a lot of people were

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.960
It were actually interested in it

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.700
so that kind of gave me like the energy to

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.740
like really start working on full-time and just kind of see where see where it went and it was really like projects like

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.800
Pydantic and like Sebastian started like commenting on issues and stuff and I was like wow like real

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:56.000
Serious projects are looking at this like crazy tool and let me just see I'm just gonna do whatever it takes to make it like

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.800
A feasible choice and just started like cranking through like all the issues and all the things that we were missing

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.840
It escalated pretty quickly. I think did it surprise you? Oh, yes. Yes, absolutely

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.480
I was convinced that I had

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:15.400
Faced like this problem around tooling as like our code base got large at my last company and that there was an opportunity to like build

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:21.840
Like better more performant tooling. I genuinely wasn't sure like how widely that message would resonate with people

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.400
And so I know it's like a little bit of luck, right?

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.600
Like sometimes you work on great projects and then like they go nowhere and like just no one happens to see it

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.960
And then sometimes you work on a good thing and like it does go somewhere

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.600
And so there are certain things that are within your control certain things that aren't I feel like I feel like we did I did

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:41.000
A good job of like communicating the project and like why it was interesting and why it was exciting

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.080
But I also feel like I got a little bit lucky that it just like gravitated towards the right people and got attention the right

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:52.360
Ways sure also maybe that black had existed which is a little ironic because black kind of solves a real similar problem

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:57.280
But like people were okay, we embrace the idea of the thing that rough does really well

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.920
You know, you just convince them to use rough in that sense

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.920
Yeah, I mean we have a little bit I mean it gets back to this like we have a little bit of like a

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.440
Like a second mover advantage, right?

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.080
Really exactly a lot of existing tools that people use already and like a lot of those practices

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:17.480
like the idea of using a format or the idea of running code mods like the idea of using a linter and like the knowledge of

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:23.200
Like what kinds of rules are valuable and like what kinds of analysis we can do like all this have existed

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.320
And that was part of part of the story really was I was like these tools are great and I get a lot of value

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:34.280
Out of them, but I want them to be like easier and faster. And so yeah, there's definitely a strong timing thing

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.520
I think like I think rust - this is maybe like a little bit more specific to what we're doing

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.640
but like, you know

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.920
I think like the intersection between Python and rust has or the I guess the

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.240
Dinner operability between them and sort of the ecosystem around it has just grown a lot

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.920
I mean still I would say like pretty early but it's like matured and grow a lot over the past few years

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.920
And so even just the fact that like at my last company

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.640
we started to introduce rust and we started to like move some of our core systems into rust and and

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.640
Expose them over pi o3 like the fact that was existed and the fact that I was like exposed to that like that's all just

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.560
Like pure chance. Otherwise, I never would have thought to do this. Very cool. Well, congrats well deserved

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:16.820
Well, we're all doing that all using rough as we said is excellent. Well, which is awesome

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.840
How why do you think it took off? Did you try stuff before? What's the story?

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.680
I tried a lot of stuff before before get hub, you know coding has always been my hobby

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.160
You know

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.160
I do it for work and come home and work on a hobby project and it just seemed natural to want to share it

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.960
Pre get hub. I would just put stuff on my blog and get some feedback from it there

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:41.680
I quite enjoyed that and yeah, I have a number of open source projects pre rich had a BB code

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.960
Parsing library. I had a chess library. I had a web toolkit

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.440
So yeah, when rich came along it was another happy project something to keep me entertained

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.560
Why why is this terminal so boring? Come on, see what we can do about that

00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:00.240
You know, I'd always used the terminal and I always struggled when you've got a page of white text on black background

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.280
and you're trying to pick out an IP address from somewhere and

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:08.000
You know, I'd always wished I wish I could just it would just format it and colorize it for me

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
I know this is possible, but it doesn't happen

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.080
So then yeah, I just I started it and it came together quite well when I released it

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.280
It was like boom and the stars just started accumulating got lots of feedback

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:26.080
It was very exciting and I kept building on it. It was kind of like an issue driven development

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.600
So people would just ask for something. Oh, that's a good idea

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:34.200
I go ahead and that and implement it and it grew from there and it became really large

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.280
I did actually prior to rich I had a library called pi file system

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.340
And this is kind of like a wrapper to file systems

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:47.200
so you can have the same interface for your FTP server as a hard drive for a zip file s3 bucket and

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.560
That got some use in the community. It wasn't enormous

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:57.160
But I thought taught me a lot about building open source, you know managing feedback

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.600
issues, etc

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.280
so that was a great experience when I started working on on rich and

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.680
I I was very surprised actually how successful it became

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:12.440
I remember the first time I realized that this is bigger than just a hobby project as when someone told me off for violating

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:19.240
Semver I released a clear a clear breaking change because I thought and nobody's using that yet, but they were

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:24.280
So the next day I got told off quite appropriately and then I thought okay

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.060
I'll probably take this more seriously if people are using this in the day job

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:33.240
They can't just have someone who's just like throwing new bits of code and changing functionality

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.960
They had to I had to treat it like it was an actual my day job. Yeah

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.200
well

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.720
Everyone on the call here probably has a little bit of nervousness about like if I break this

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.960
There are a lot of people that depend on this thing

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:51.560
Yeah, and it's so different like it just changes so much like the early like when you're talking about the issue driven development thing

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.600
too I was like

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:57.400
I just remember that phase of like rough where it was like anyone who cared all about the project

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.560
All I wanted to do is like make them happy

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.640
Right. And I was like, oh wow

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.080
That seems like a cool idea like let's definitely do it and I'm just like, you know

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.840
It was the point in time where I could like fix the bug cut a release the same day

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:14.200
And then like their thing is fixed and then it's like, okay great now we have a relationship like thanks for using my thing

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.240
Like blah blah

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.200
I just think like but that has changed so much right because then I went through those same experiences of like I

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:25.400
I ship a release with a breaking change. I didn't really document a lot of people get upset and then you realize okay

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.760
I actually have some more responsibility now. Yeah these days

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:36.200
it's more like trying to find the balance between saying no to stuff that you then have to end up maintaining and not

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:43.000
like disappointing people too much because you say no or things like that and then trying to to keep this whole

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.800
Interaction with people nice even though you don't want to do stuff

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.920
They they want you to do because you know, it's better for the project

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:58.600
This portion of Talk Python To Me has brought you by sentry, you know sentry for the air monitoring service

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:04.040
The one that we use right here at talk python, but this time I want to tell you about a new and free workshop

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:10.200
He mean the kraken managing a python mono repo with sentry joined salma alam

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:16.220
Nayor senior developer advocate at sentry and david winterbottom head of engineering at kraken technologies

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:24.600
For an inside look into how he and his team develop deploy and maintain a rapidly evolving python mono repo with over four

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.440
million lines of code that powers the kraken utility platform

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:35.640
In this workshop david will share how his department of 500 developers who deploy around 200 times a day

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:42.200
Use sentry to reduce noise prioritize issues and maintain code quality without relying on a dedicated q a team

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:48.600
You'll learn how to find and fix root causes of crashes ways to prioritize the most urgent crashes and errors

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.640
And tips to streamline your workflow join them for free on tuesday, february 27th

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:58.680
2024 at 2 a.m. Pacific time just visit talk by thon.fm

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:03.220
Sentry dash mono repo that link is in your podcast player show notes

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.180
2 a.m. Might be a little early here in the u.s

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:12.740
But go ahead and sign up anyway, if you're a u.s listener because i'm sure they'll email you about a follow-up recording as well

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:15.700
Thank you to sentry for supporting this episode

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:23.620
Prs are like cake or puppies as if it's a simple bug fix that's like cake. You'd like. Thank you

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.700
Um, I enjoyed that cake then move on but some prs are like a puppy

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.420
It's like perfect you like puppies, but you've got to feed them and clean up after them

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:37.940
Why am I staying in the rain with this puppy on like a friday night? How do I get here collecting the puppies poop?

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:43.300
Yes, exactly. Sometimes you say thank you, but I just can't I just can't look after another puppy right now

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:48.740
That's a difficult thing to come to terms with when the project gets a bit more mature because previously you're accepting all the puppies

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.860
but then you have to start saying no no to puppies and

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.740
Which definitely got there because it accumulated do you hate puppies? Come on. That's a pretty hard stance

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.140
I'm, kind of a cat person to be honest with you

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.700
But yeah, I mean you have to say no

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:07.780
Eventually. Yeah, I think this is where this is where plugins always kind of like to take the center stage, right?

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.460
You're like just oh that sounds like a great idea for you to maintain external to my library

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:16.820
That was exactly my approach to the whole situation. Yep. Here's a plugin api. Have fun

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:24.580
But also the probability of some little change breaking someone's code and like being considered a breaking change

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.500
Grows as the project grows in usage and like, you know

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:35.060
Like at some point it's like almost any change will end up breaking someone in very unexpected ways

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.140
Because they are doing something really really weird, but you know, like someone is doing it

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:44.900
So like it it becomes more and more difficult to know like is this a breaking change or not?

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:51.060
Like no one should be using this variable here or this parameter but like, you know, there's someone out there doing that

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:55.460
So I feel defining what is actually a breaking change and what is what?

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:01.700
What is this trick? It's more difficult as things grow. Yeah, I don't know one of the things

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:06.500
I like that the django project did was kind of basically only things that are documented are supported

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.660
Basically, that was kind of the line they drew and I thought that was a pretty good pretty good way to to draw it

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.460
But yeah, you're always you know, that never actually works. That doesn't make people happy

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.640
It just gives you plausible deniability

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.900
Don't yell at me. It's not my fault

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:24.340
I think adding a formal like versioning policy is one of the best things that we did because for a long time

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:30.340
Rough was just we only used patch releases. So we got to like 0 0 like 285 or something

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:35.860
and we had basically no guarantees about what would or wouldn't change like across releases and

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.260
As the project got more and more popular like that started to cause more and more problems

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.900
and so zany someone on our team like when they joined one of the first few things they did was like create an actual

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.580
Formal versioning policy and we added like preview behavior

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:54.340
So like you can opt similar that what block has kind of opt in to like breaking or more experimental changes

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.500
And so now we have like clear expectations around what it means to like bump a minor release, etc

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:05.300
Etc. And like that has made our lives a lot easier like actually having clear expectations around that that are communicated and respected

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.580
But it's the kind of thing that you just don't think about at all until at least I didn't

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:10.900
Ratchet configure

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:16.900
Yeah, some people's code runs things like fast api or octa print or whatever

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.700
Your stuff rewrites people's code

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.620
Yeah, but at least it doesn't run at runtime. I don't know. I actually think it's easier

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.940
Yeah

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.980
Indeed. All right

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:32.980
I finally talk about the plugins thing because like i've actually very intentionally taken the opposite approach which is we have like almost no public

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.580
api

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:39.700
Because like the only public api is the cli and like we don't expose our api in any other way

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.740
And that's because like we know we're going to change like everything

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:48.820
Internally like pretty dramatically and so we wanted to have like full control over that without having to worry about breaking people's stuff yet

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.220
But it's like it's starting to become more of a problem because more and more people want to use it as a library in like

00:33:53.220 --> 00:34:00.500
Different ways, but it's it's sort of a counterintuitive way to like make our lives easier as maintainers was like not expose any public api

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.780
Apart from the cli. Yeah, very interesting. It's funny funny

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.900
Sort of anecdote i'm a rewriting a lot of the documentation for sql model

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.540
Because I want to have examples right right now

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:16.660
I have examples that are compatible with python 3.7 and above but actually 3.6 and above but I want to have

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.340
also the syntax for 3.9 and 3.10 in 3.10

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:25.220
You can have like the unions using the vertical bar and these things and I want to have examples for each one of those

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.680
So the approach I did was to write a script that will automatically

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:33.940
Update each one of the files by calling rough as a soup process. So that's the api

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.980
And then like, you know, like I mean the process is like doing all that stuff but like yeah, it's like another

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.600
family of problems

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:45.700
Right, that's an api before it's available. Yeah with

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:48.900
Right an api will be created

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:56.660
Exactly. I've heard this before as like hyrum's law, which is like with a sufficiently large number of users like any implementation detail

00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:01.540
Become someone will eventually rely on an implementation detail like any arbitrary implementation

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:07.060
Someone is probably relying on that behavior, which is basically the behavior of the program is the api in the end, unfortunately

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:12.740
We'll find the underscore functions. You've tried to dissuade them from using and all the things, you know, eric

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.700
What's the the origin story for read the docs and what'd you try and how do you think it caught on?

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.900
Yeah, so I mean this was kind of way back in the day

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.080
But yeah, I kind of got started writing django plugins, you know apropos to the conversation

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.420
You know

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:31.220
I was working at the lawrence journal world that where django came from and it was kind of early in my career

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.460
And I was just kind of getting excited about open source and blogging

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:38.020
And just basically built a few of these kind of testing related open source projects

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.900
And then that was kind of where I got started with open source

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.180
And then basically it was the classic scratch scratch your own itch thing, right?

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.800
Like it's like I have a bunch of open source projects. I want to write documentation

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.260
How do I solve that problem and back in the day? That was a much harder problem to solve, right?

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:58.260
It was basically just like build a zip file and upload it to uh packages.python.org if folks remember that one

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:03.380
Or was it packages or whatever the docs there was a docs hosting on pypi basically

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:03.940
And yeah

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.780
Basically just wanted to kind of build a better version of that that integrated with github

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.620
I feel like webhooks were like the cool new thing back in 2010, you know

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.260
Uh, and so that was really kind of the insight right?

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:18.020
It's like let's build this kind of like cicd workflow on top of webhooks

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:23.220
And actually did build a kind of a version of that the previous year around kind of like code quality stuff

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:28.900
So it actually ran kind of like a linter and built a website on commit and had a similar kind of workflow

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:32.840
Right where it like gave you a grade and did all this kind of stuff, which is like 2009

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.300
And yeah that that didn't really catch on at all

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.620
but then I think read the docs just we built it and

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.940
Then I was using it for my own projects and I actually

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.860
Had the need to kind of maintain it and keep it updated and then I think people just kind of

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.740
Kind of grew naturally, you know gave some conference talks that kind of stuff

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.660
But I think it just solved a problem that people had and that's always going to be the you know

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:56.260
The best way to to grow a thing. So yeah, absolutely. Awesome. What's read the docs written in? Is it django?

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:59.940
Yeah, it's all django and python, uh funny coincidence. I went to

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.780
College in lawrence at the university of kansas. So oh nice

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.060
I was right there right at the the heart of django

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:13.060
But I moved off to grad school like a couple years before all that happened. So I missed missed the excitement

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.660
I grew up in virginia and everyone's like you're going to kansas. You graduated school

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:20.660
Like what how are you going there? Like what everybody thought is the weirdest decision?

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:26.660
But yeah, like I really do think you know ending up in that python and django ecosystem has been pretty transformative to my to my life

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.900
So, you know worked out lawrence a pretty cool little town actually of all the places. Yeah

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.900
sebastian

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:38.100
How do you come about this crazy idea to put types into our web apps, you know python that's dynamic

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.540
It doesn't have types. What are you doing? Yeah, I don't know so crazy

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:47.380
it's so fun to see it said michael larson in the chat like they maintain our url d3 and the

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:56.100
security developer in resilience just like chatting along with us like he probably has had to deal so much stuff as us

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.660
just

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:04.180
So like some of the first things that I did in open source were actually docker images for deploying flask

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:08.420
Because I was working with us and deploying flask was difficult

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:14.500
And I needed to be able to combine nginx with uwisgi and like a bunch of things and like they all had their own

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.620
Custom configuration files and it was you know, like so difficult

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:22.340
I didn't like doing that and then I just had to study how to do that stuff

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:28.100
And then after going through all that I wanted to save everyone else's time doing that. They were like well

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:33.700
Let's just put a docker image with this and a lot of documentation of how this docker image works and how it

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.860
How you can use it with some sensible defaults?

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.820
So, you know, it was just like a weird contraption that was it

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:43.460
But it actually grew and like got like a few stars like a bunch of stars for me

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:47.300
It was a lot, you know, like a hundred stars. Oh my gosh, i'm an open source

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.060
And then like at some point I had like a thousand stars or something like that

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:56.340
I was so happy about that and at some point it was kind of the de facto standard for doing flask

00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:01.780
Docker flask in doc that was the first thing that I did. I ended up with fast api

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:07.380
I was I was avoiding building fast api for a long while and I was trying all the all the frameworks modular tools

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:11.220
I I was convinced that there was something that would do the things that I wanted

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:16.260
I just had to find it and as I was trying different frameworks also in different languages. I was

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:22.500
Extending the list of things that I wanted to have and also a list of things that I wanted not to have for example

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.700
I didn't know that takes you farther and farther away from any exactly

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.980
Having one that will take all the voices

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.020
So it was like ah

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:36.100
But then I realized like I really like this thing of having types as in types because you get out of completion and inline errors

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.420
And this is so cool. It's so cool to be able to have this

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:43.220
I want to have this in python and then python other type annotations and it's like this is great

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.500
How do I use them? There's no way to use them with the current frameworks

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.180
So at some point I actually found the right framework

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:55.780
It was called api star by the same author of django rest framework. It was just missing some authentication stuff

00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:00.100
I said like, okay i'm going to contribute to the stuff when I was about to jump into the code

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:06.180
He said I have to deprecate this I will go focus full on startlet and then he went to build something

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:11.060
This is don christie, which is super prolific. I'm an amazing open source person in general

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:15.780
And then at that point is when I said like, ah, I just have to try it. Let's just do it

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:20.580
So i'm just gonna try to build something that will be kind of like spiritual successor to

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:27.300
Api start built on top of startlet. So I was you know, like I was actually narrating all the learnings from flask

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:32.500
Django, django rest framework and all the ecosystem and just like bringing all those ideas together

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.580
At least that was my intention and then I wanted to have a bit of better type annotations

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.940
So I I saw that by dantic was using standard type annotation

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:44.980
So people don't have to learn this like, you know from fast api for special string or something like that

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.980
Just instead of that just use pure string

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.400
So I wanted to have something based on standards

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:56.580
Like open api json schema and all the stuff and based on standard python and to have like the simplest syntax possible and to

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.500
You know, like give the best developer experience possible while you know

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:07.940
Like not adding like any any additional steps for developers to build something that by default will have all the best practices built in

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:12.660
That was the the intention and I was just like trying to solve it for the things that I was working on

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.780
I was supposed to be doing ai and machine learning and stuff

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:20.520
But like I have to stop for a bit to solve apis. I got stuck in apis

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:26.980
Oh, I think you made a pretty decent choice it seems like fast api is doing all right. Yeah

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:32.420
Yeah, I just saw you much better than what I ever had expected. Yeah, I know congratulations

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:37.700
Well, it's also deserved but I also just saw an x I don't know a post on

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:45.140
X twitter, whatever you however you address these things where you said you showed a a graph where the number of

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.820
github stars for fast api just passed flask and you know

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:53.460
I have a lot of respect for flask and the palace team and david lord and all those folks

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:57.700
But you know awesome awesome that your stuff has taken off so much. That's really cool. It's super cool

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.340
It's amazing

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.740
and you know like flask was one of the big inspirations for fast api and i've been able to

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:06.580
To be at this point. It's crazy like yeah, I still can't

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:11.780
Get over it. Yeah, super cool. Super cool to be able to build all this and to keep building more stuff

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.780
So yeah, super nice. Yeah one final

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.580
Comment before we move on to octoprint

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:22.660
but one of the things I kind of see you doing in the world is you're like the combiner you're like, oh,

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.740
we've got this cool stuff with pydantic and

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:31.220
Starlet and how could we combine it in this way to make this, you know and and swagger like similarly with sql model

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:36.020
You're like well pydantic is cool and but uh sql alchemy is kind of cool, but it could be more better

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.420
You know, like it'd be better. Right? So anyway, good job

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.180
Like typer that is the library for building command line applications

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.900
You just click with the type annotations the same ideas from pydantic and now with you know

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:54.260
Like integrated building support for rich so like also picking will's work trying just just to put a bunch of things together

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.980
I'm, just you know, like i'm just making cocktails everywhere

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.220
Yes, exactly

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:04.500
It's more than that, but there is a lot of value in combining things in a smart way and accessible. Yeah. Awesome

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.780
All right, gina you told us a little bit about the origin story

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.500
But like what do you try before and then I have a follow-up question. I think it's unique to your project

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:17.880
I wouldn't necessarily say that I tried anything before because the whole thing was completely unintentional

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.240
I basically bought myself a 3d printer in late 2012

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.300
I wanted to be able to put it in my spare bathroom and monitor it from afar

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.580
Because back then this thing was tying up my pc

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:34.740
You had to constantly have keep it connected so it could operate and that for hours and hours and it made noises and it produced

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:40.980
Fumes and I just wanted it out of my office and to be able to play games on my pc again instead of having it

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.340
Yeah, basically communicate constantly with a 3d printer

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:50.100
and so I bought myself a raspberry pi and I was looking online for something to be able to just put on this pi and

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:54.740
Attach to the printer and throw a wi-fi dongle in because back then the pi didn't have wi-fi built in

00:43:54.740 --> 00:44:00.980
And throw that in the spare bathroom, but there wasn't anything so over the course of my christmas break in 2012

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.300
I sat down and changed that and this is basically the origin story of octoprint

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:09.380
I just wanted to scratch my own itch. I wanted to put my printer in my spare bathroom

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:14.580
This is all and apparently a lot of people had the same problem because I just you know

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:19.060
Like how how we like to do these things we build something that we think might be interesting

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.340
We throw it up on github and go just like here go nuts

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:28.500
Enjoy have fun with that and I suddenly started getting emails from all around the world like hey, I have this in this printer

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:34.580
Can you also make it work with that? And so this escalated and I went like oh someone is using it

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.740
Of course i'm going to add this support

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:42.340
And of course i'm going to add this feature and it just grew and grew and grew and grew and apparently I just hit a nerve

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.020
So this was utterly unplanned

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:49.540
this was never my intention at all and I just wanted to solve my own problem and

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:54.340
Have continued to solve my own problems and the problems of other people ever since

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:59.460
Before octoprint I actually was also quite active in a little project called doku wiki where I was

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.940
developing some plugins for that and

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:08.660
I even did open source before I knew what open source was with some php scripts when I was 18 or so

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.260
That I threw up on my website. But yeah octoprint was

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:18.420
Like it took over my life. It just was an accident a happy little accident. Maybe how do you decide?

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:23.540
Okay, this is a job for me rather than just a thing you worked on

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.620
The thing is by 20

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.620
Mid 2013. I went to 80 on my regular day job

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:36.100
I used to be a software architect slash consultant with big corporation java world all the enterprise stuff and

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:42.340
To to be able to dedicate one day per week fully to octoprint plus of course the weekends and the after hours and the vacations

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:47.640
And all of that and that still didn't suffice anymore by 2014

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:52.980
And I noticed that it was impacting my health. It was impacting my relationships and that was actually

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:58.580
Quite perfect timing really when this this company that hired me initially approached me and said hey

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.980
Do you want to maybe fly out to us and we'll chat?

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.900
And if you like all of that what we have to propose then we can just do that

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:09.880
And this is how it then continued to go from 2014 until 2016

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:15.940
And yeah, it was never my intention to become self-employed. I'm a quite risk averse person actually

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.860
So when this point came where I was like, okay either I

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:26.340
Find a way to keep funding this or I have to really drop it because it was way too big by then to be kept

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:33.700
As a pet project without being utterly utterly unhealthy. Yeah, I decided to jump into the cold water and have been trying to keep up

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:41.060
At the surface ever since basically, so yeah, all of that really completely unplanned cool. What an adventure, huh? Indeed

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:46.740
Yeah, and the good thing is even if people don't understand what open sources or what code is I always have quite a topic

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:53.060
At parties so that is fun because yeah, like people give you money for something they can get for free. What?

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:57.220
Exactly. Yeah, if you're not familiar with open source, then it definitely is a weird

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:03.380
It was tricky to find a text consultant who understands the concept. So yeah, I can imagine. Oh, yeah, that's interesting

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:09.140
I'm sure. All right. I was very recently. I was like, what do you do? What is your day job?

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:12.820
I'm like, oh i'm a software developer. So you work for a company not really

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:22.820
Well, I build software that is free for others to use and who's paying you a company that pays money to companies to build companies

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:27.780
So you're building a company. No, it's actually, you know, like it was a long conversation. They got bored and later

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.900
This doesn't make any sense

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:31.220
Yeah

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:33.700
I've just taken to say i'm a software developer and I work

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:40.340
With 3d printers and then people usually stop asking questions because 3d printers are this mysterious thing that no one understands

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:45.540
Anyhow, usually at least and then yeah, unless they say oh 3d printers and then I say, yeah

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:50.180
Do you know 3d printers and they go? Yeah. Yeah, I have one and then I can say oh, do you know octoprint?

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:54.100
Yes. Oh, yeah, I made that and then oh, yeah, it's tricky to explain to people

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:59.380
I'm, sometimes not even sure my parents understand what I do. So i'm sure that my parents don't understand what I do

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:06.020
That's okay, i'm sure they're still proud of you anyway, it's fine. Yeah, mine might definitely are proud of me

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:11.540
I would like to just maybe getting a little short on time. You're coming up to the end of our avengers meeting

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.300
Let's close it out with this

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.980
Go around one more time let y'all or maybe just as a group kind of chime in on this

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:21.940
Speaking to the people out there listening who want to start an open source project or want to contribute to open source or somehow

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:27.220
Kind of get involved in similar ways. What would you do different if you started now?

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.300
Many of you have worked on this for a long time

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.140
You've had a lot of experience like if somebody said well the world is, you know

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:40.100
Somehow the memory has been erased from the fact that rough or rich or octet or whatever existed, you know

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.660
Just start over. What would you do different or or the same? I would use fast api

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.340
Yay good use of a time machine there

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:53.460
Everybody like i've had multiple conversations over the years where people are like, why don't you use this library? I'm like, oh it didn't exist

00:48:53.460 --> 00:49:01.380
Exactly. Yeah, this is the problem, right? Exactly when you actually have a plug-in system then swapping out stuff like that can become

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:08.340
Very tricky. Absolutely when I get asked what to work on what to study what to focus how to get into open source or like

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:14.580
Almost any of those questions. I always say that the the main advice I give is just to focus on a problem

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:20.180
That is important to you more than you know, like innovation market disruption or whatever

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.980
Just like focus on a problem that is actually important to you

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:28.020
Hopefully that is important to others as well. And if it's not a problem that affects you directly

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.940
Hopefully it affects someone that is very close to you so you can get like a very tight feed

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:38.260
Feedback loop of what you are building and then try to solve it and then use that as the guide of what to do

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:44.660
What to learn what to focus on what to do in many cases is just learning a framework that all it's already there

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:51.460
You know, like why will I go and build a system to control 3d printers instead of just like learning how to use auto print

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:55.300
In many cases solving the problem is just like using the tool that is already there

00:49:55.380 --> 00:50:01.140
But then in some cases you end up figuring out that there's no tool and you just have to build it. There's actually no

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:06.820
Linter and formatter that can be super fast so you can run it every time you just hit save

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:10.580
So then you just have to build it in Rust and like create rough or like, you know

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:16.260
Like there's always like this thing that you are trying to solve that is just not so there yet

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:21.380
And that is what gives you the best value and the best outcome in many cases

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.900
it can be just like, you know contributing to another open source project or

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:31.540
Building something new but the the thing is like for me is just like focusing on a problem that is important. That is what what?

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.660
What has worked for me at least good advice?

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.900
I would add to that that you really shouldn't try to

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.860
You need to be really passionate about the thing as well, right?

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.860
It needs to be something that is really something you're into something that will

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:50.260
That you what will want to spend a lot of time on that is actually not your working hours and such because otherwise

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:57.300
The the whole jock until this becomes anything viable anything big enough to support you in any kind of way

00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:01.860
Even if it's just being able to I don't know drink an additional coffee per week or something

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:07.060
That will be a quiet long slog and a lot of work and a lot of blood and sweat and tears

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.820
And so you really need to be into this so that you want to do that

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.940
If you are just in that for the end goal of I don't know

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:18.340
Becoming rich through open source, which by the way would probably not work only when I go rich

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:21.060
then

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.980
Then this will not work out

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:27.540
You need to focus on the path to the goal and not the goal a lot of people try to

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:33.380
Reach for the end goal before they actually are willing to actually walk the path. I also get this along

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:37.540
I happen to be uh in the github star program and i've had a lot of people ask me

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:40.900
How do you become a github star and that is just the wrong question to ask?

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:45.140
That's just the same as it is. How do you become an open source maintainer of a popular project?

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:49.700
Like you you just have to do whatever you are interested in

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.580
You have to do work and you have to be passionate about your work

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:58.820
And then maybe if you hit the right nerve, then that will happen and maybe it won't I think it's very interesting that

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:04.580
None of us had like a career path to where we are now. We didn't set out to be where we are now

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:09.620
It just feels like we were kind of followed our own intuition and it worked out

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:14.580
Which means it's very difficult when someone asks me. Well, how do you become an open source developer? How do you start a company?

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:18.180
It's like i'm not quite sure I can tell you my path to there

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:21.860
Very hard for me to articulate to someone else how to get there

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.020
I think there's a lot of luck involved as well, right?

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:28.340
It's like you have to do all this stuff and then roll this dice if it gets a six then you can be successful

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:33.220
Yeah, there's an element of luck, but it's kind of like a luck you make for yourself

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:38.100
Yeah, and it might take you to somewhere else or it might not but as long as you're passionate about it and you enjoy it

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:43.700
Then great things will happen. I think well also will and charlie you both took some specific time

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.100
on your own money to really

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.660
Level up what you're working on which is that's pretty brave, right?

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:54.580
Like not a lot of people would say i'm just gonna spend my savings to work on this project and see if I can make it

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:59.140
Go, so you've earned some of that through taking that chance and putting in that time and effort

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:03.940
I think for me that didn't last very long because for three months I was living on github sponsorship

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.620
VCs came along and then there was like cash and everything changed

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.580
Your world changed and you had to learn a whole new set of skills. I'm sure

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.940
A job and responsibilities. I do feel really lucky that like I said

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:19.780
This is my first time being a maintainer and like it was very clear to me quickly that like

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:25.380
For rough to have the pace of development and like the scope that it has it like had to be a full-time thing

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:28.340
and like that that was pretty obvious to me quickly and I just

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:33.940
I have a lot of respect for people who've been maintainers for longer periods of time and in a way where it's not their

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.180
Full-time job or they have to do it on the side

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.740
I think I haven't really been in that position

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:42.660
But it's already clear to me that that takes like a lot of dedication and commitment

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:46.340
So i'm just I feel very lucky that I get to work on open source full-time

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:47.940
I know it's not all entirely luck, right?

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:52.020
Like we were saying like you increase your luck surface area and then opportunities come your way

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:56.900
But like but I do think it's just a very fortunate position that like these kind of opportunities do exist

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:01.700
Yeah, because maintaining popular stuff is a lot. It's a lot. There are privileges that come with it 100%

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:05.140
But I mean, yeah, it's a ton. It's a it's a lot of work and a lot of stress

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:11.140
Yeah, a lot of responsibility. Well, and you don't necessarily have to start your own right away. I didn't have gray hair before this

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:12.820
You don't necessarily have to start your own either

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:17.780
you could contribute to a really popular one and kind of get into the scene and you know, like eric that sounds a little bit like

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:22.740
Your story like you were in the django scene and then spun off from that what you guys are doing, right?

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:28.420
Yeah, definitely and you know part of an open source community and definitely kind of going to pycon and and just kind of being

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:34.580
Surrounded by those people because that was always the it's very lonely work just to have a an inbox of github issues and then no

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:36.580
inbox, thank yous

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:41.940
you know and like going to conferences and that kind of stuff was really where you you feel the appreciation and you really kind of

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:47.940
Actually feel the the value that you're providing as well as just the the stress of the uh of the things you're breaking

00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:50.420
So totally agree with that. Absolutely

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:55.940
The conferences are great to really feel the appreciation rather than just the the requests

00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:58.820
They'll say thank you and then they'll give you a bug report, but at least the thank you

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:05.460
I'm talking to you. There was this could I just show you this one thing we're doing that's not working, right?

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:10.420
Oh gosh, here we go an interesting observation for me has been that like a year ago

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.660
I didn't really know anyone in python open source

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:17.140
Like at all and like I was a user of python in my day job every day

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:22.740
But like I was not interacting with and in a year. Yeah now like sebastian we've interacted a bunch

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.100
Like there's just a lot of people that i've come to know and think of as like friends

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:30.740
So I think they're really, you know, especially if you're interested in getting involved in like putting in work

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:36.020
I really don't think there are significant barriers and like you get out of it what you put in

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:41.300
So I think i've been very impressed with just how welcoming and friendly the community has been especially other maintainers

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:42.420
Yeah, absolutely

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:46.420
Talked to a lot of people who show up at pycon and they're like I was really nervous to come here or I feel

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:50.900
Like it didn't fit in and they're you know, they just had such a great experience and I said well

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.860
Did you feel like out of that was my first pycon this year?

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:58.260
I'd never been to a fight. I'd never been to a python conference. And so I was like we did up at such an amazing party

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:02.500
Yeah, that's true I love the benihana, yeah

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:06.340
That was interesting. All right guys. Well, I think we are

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:12.420
Pretty much out of time anyone want to have some final thoughts for listeners before we wrap it up go on build some cool stuff

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.580
Who's brave enough?

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:18.980
How come a tainer today I think give cake not puppies. Let's leave it with that, huh?

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:25.220
All right, give cake no puppies and be really careful before you start a popular source project. It might take over your life

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:30.820
If you want this great, but if not, then yeah careful what you wish for you might get it exactly

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:36.660
