00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Did you make this year's PyCon event in the US?


00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.640
There was a lot of excitement this time around in Salt Lake City.


00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.380
In this episode, I'll bring you a bunch of experiences we had this year.


00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.460
It starts with a frequent guest, Jay Miller, turns the tables and interviews me at the


00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.640
Microsoft booth on the Expo Hall floor in front of a live audience.


00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.440
And then you'll hear from Mario Munoz, Nick Moua, Chris Williams, Ray McClendon, and Sean


00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.220
Tibor about their time at the conference.


00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.220
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 413, recorded April 21st, 2023.


00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:48.160
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python.


00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.020

I want to welcome everybody to the something something hundredth episode of


00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.480
of Talk Python to me.


00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.960
I am your host, Jay Miller.


00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.740
Our normal host, Michael Kennedy,


00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.940
apparently had some flight issues.


00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.880
Oh no, he's here.


00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.340
>> I'm here. Hello everyone.


00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.980
>> We talked about this and I said,


00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.060
"I have an idea, trust me."


00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.620
And you said, "Okay."


00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.260
>> I trust you, Jay. This is going to be fun.


00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.460
>> I think a lot of people have made that mistake in the past,


00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.700
but I'm going to be interviewing you.


00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.060
For those that don't know, I'm Jay Miller.


00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.060
I am a now six-time guest on the show.


00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.220
I think you get a jacket for that.


00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.060
- You're in the 1%.


00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.900
You're a 1%.


00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.160
- I am in the 1%. - The top 1% of guests.


00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.540
- The only person who's been on the show


00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.300
more times than me is my boss,


00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.100
which is annoying, 'cause he will rub it in


00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.580
after he hears this.


00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.420
But yeah, Mike, we've been kind of working together


00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.500
for, what, four years now?


00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.340
- Four or five years, yeah.


00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.540
- Four or five years.


00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.820
For those that don't know,


00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.340
I do a little bit of marketing behind the scenes.


00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.100
So, if you get that newsletter,


00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.980
if you're not subscribed to the Talk Python newsletter,


00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.020
you need to be. I work really hard on that.


00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.060
By the way, it may not come out this weekend because I'm here.


00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.740
Just so you know. But yes,


00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.820
so we've known each other for four or five years.


00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.380
I think I was on episode 15 or something like that.


00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.940
>> Yeah, quite early. About developer productivity.


00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.380
>> Yeah.


00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.980
>> It's wonderful.


00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.360
So, I wanted to take this time to ask you


00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.740
questions similar to what you would do.


00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.600
And let's start with one of the easiest ones of why a podcast?


00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.220
>> Why a podcast?


00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.380
Well, I've done a lot of different things trying to teach


00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.360
people coding and evangelize coding and that


00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.880
involve things like going to user group talks,


00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.640
or doing trainings and all these were like,


00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.620
"Hey, it's awesome.


00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.580
20 people showed up and are really engaged.


00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.740
But what if you leverage the internet to reach more people?


00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.300
That was really one of the motivations,


00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.780
is just how can you have a bigger impact.


00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.460
And when I got started with Talk Python,


00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.260
there were zero Python podcasts.


00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.340
I'm like, why are there zero Python podcasts?


00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.780
There have been some before, but they'd all shut down.


00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.540
And I'm like, that doesn't make any sense.


00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.940
Such a vibrant community and no one to interview and share


00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.940
the stories of it.


00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.740
So, here we are, seven, eight years later.


00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.340
>> Yeah. I mean, you've really trailblazed that industry.


00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.780
I think since your show,


00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.260
we've had Tobias started podcasting it.


00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.140
Dan has a Real Python podcast.


00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.860
I think Chris is running. Hey, is that Chris right there?


00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.060
>> Yeah, that is Chris. He's getting a shout out right here.


00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.420
>> Speaking of the Real Python podcast right there,


00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.340
I think Sean's here from Teaching Python.


00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.300
>> Sean and Tibor is here.


00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.300
We've even seen it expand into smaller niches like Django.


00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.100
We have the Django chats.


00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.820
>> Yeah, Django chats.


00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.760
>> Some of those shows and a little show,


00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.020
Python Community News on YouTube, go check that out.


00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.660
But it's great that you started this thing


00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.940
because there wasn't a thing there and then afterwards,


00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.700
a ton of shows showed up and I


00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.900
see some other podcasters in the audience.


00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.540
I think I see Python Bytes and Test and Code,


00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.660
Brian Aukin here as well.


00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.100
How does it feel to see that now that you


00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.220
kick-started things, the ecosystem is thriving?


00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.660
>> I think it's fantastic.


00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.580
Like I said, the goal was to share


00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.140
the stories of this community that weren't being told.


00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.140
And now I think so many people have taken up that torch.


00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.100
It's great. And I think there's room for all of us.


00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.860
We all have our own special flavor


00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.780
and people can gravitate to what they like.


00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.040
>> Yeah. And you've interviewed a few hundred people.


00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.420
>> I think we're over 450 different guests so far in the show.


00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.460
>> Did you think there was that much to talk about in the Python space?


00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.220
>> I had a plan, Jay.


00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.820
I had a plan and it involved five episodes.


00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.260
>> Okay.


00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.380
>> Okay. The first five,


00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.740
first one was me announcing the show.


00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.740
So four, I know four people who I can interview about this.


00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.380
I talked about SQLAlchemy,


00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.060
talked about Pyramid, the web framework,


00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.340
and a couple of other things.


00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.540
I'm like, "All right, now what?"


00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.740
But thankfully, so many people were really


00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.460
excited that, "Hey, there finally is a Python podcast."


00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.540
That was a great show. You should talk to so-and-so.


00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.820
Have you considered this?


00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.140
Now, it's just a snowball going downhill.


00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.140
It's great. But I had no idea it would make it this far, no.


00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.140
>> That's awesome.


00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.420
>> Yeah.


00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.700
>> So, I know that just between you and I working together,


00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.180
we have developed things for


00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.900
the show to make the show easier to manage and maintain.


00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.860
Has there been any projects that you've developed


00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.080
that have come out of inspiration from the show?


00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.020
>> Oh, yeah. There's tons of software behind


00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.140
the scenes that are all about automation and


00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.300
different kinds of things


00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.460
both for the podcast itself and the courses.


00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.580
It's amazing just how much these little tiny scripts or


00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.380
little things you can write in an afternoon that


00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.620
will just completely change your workday.


00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.340
You're like, "You know what? This used to be such a pain and


00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.100
now it's completely automatic or it's almost automatic."


00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.060
Really great transcripts of some of the new AI stuff,


00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.440
used to ship the files all over to different servers.


00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.900
Now, I've got to set up differently.


00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.060
But just a ton of software that's constantly written.


00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.940
It's never-ending fun and it's also a really cool playground.


00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.060
I really want to learn fast API,


00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.020
or I want to learn this thing.


00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.340
Let me just use that for this little small project I got,


00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.660
and now I have some experience with it. It's great.


00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.180
>> I have definitely gotten to witness like,


00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.340
"Oh, hey, just add this thing and


00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.420
now it'll run and do all this stuff."


00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.940
Then usually I come in and I go,


00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.220
"Hey, I built something too."


00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.420
You're like, "I can't get it to work."


00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.560
I go, "Oh, yeah, I broke it. I'm sorry.


00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.380
Your entire show is down."


00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.260
>> That's fine.


00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.940
>> I don't think I've done that yet. I haven't.


00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.580
I've brought an entire networks down.


00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.080
I don't think I've brought in the podcast down yet.


00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.000
>> I think the thing that took


00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.820
the site down for the longest was the Walrus operator.


00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.580
>> The Walrus operator.


00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:05.700
>> The Walrus operator.


00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.980
>> Shout out to the Walrus operator.


00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.100
That's my favorite part of Python.


00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.740
>> Thank you, Emily. No, the Walrus operator is awesome.


00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.580
But when the servers were running


00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.500
3.7 and I was running 3.8 on my dev machine,


00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.180
I have these little management scripts for


00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.820
all this kind of stuff we're talking about, right?


00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.180
>> Yeah.


00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.500
>> And I'm like, well, that part's not part of the website.


00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.300
I'll do that. I'll write


00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.420
Walrus operator code and all sorts of stuff.


00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.140
When I shipped it, the framework tried to


00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.060
scan to see if there was any routes in there,


00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.020
and it couldn't parse it and it just couldn't start.


00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.820
I'm like, "Why won't there work?


00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.460
I haven't even touched it. What's going on?"


00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.580
I'm like, "Oh, the Walrus operator took it down."


00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.420
>> That's funny. So you've interviewed a ton of people,


00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.820
and I'm not going to ask you to say


00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.180
who's your favorite person to interview


00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.700
because we know the answer is me.


00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.900
>> Yes.


00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.220
>> But what were some of


00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.860
the most surprising interviews that you had?


00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.900
There's a whole set of categories,


00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.500
different categories of surprising, right?


00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.180
And your shows were very interesting


00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.940
and I really enjoyed talking to you about them.


00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.220
They're really inspiring because they're not just,


00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.820
here's this API, but they're higher level, right?


00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.540
Like developer productivity and stuff.


00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.860
However, I would say the stuff that surprises me the most


00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.540
is where people are


00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.260
doing things you wouldn't have expected with Python.


00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.380
Like, "Oh, hey, we're actually using machine learning and


00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:32.900
Python to find exoplanets in old kind of stale Kepler data."


00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.340
>> Yeah.


00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.220
>> And so, there's this group in Oxford who found


00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.900
50 exoplanets running machine learning


00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.340
across data they thought was already analyzed and done.


00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.180
And you would learn weird things like they said,


00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.980
"We used to have grad students do it and that was okay,


00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.940
but it was really variable


00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.540
like the mood of the grad student matter.


00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.460
For example, at Oxford, they always had cookies and coffee


00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.540
at three, so more exoplanets were found


00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.500
after three than before three.


00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.660
There's no difference in the data, but you know,


00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.780
and they're like, if we could bring some automation,


00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.140
that might make science a little more scientific.


00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.860
- Developer productivity tip, add cookies and coffee


00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.580
to your daily routine, right?


00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.900
- Yeah, for sure, for sure.


00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.620
- So I'm thinking about a particular episode


00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.940
that I was on where you had Rivers Cuomo from Weezer.


00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.420
- That was one of the more notable ones, yes.


00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.140
- That was, I just, I remember getting the message


00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.180
from you of like, hey, you're gonna be on the show


00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.380
this week, and I was like, I can't, I've gotta,


00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.520
and he's like, no, no, no, no, no, you are going


00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.900
to be on the show this week.


00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.980
- You'll want to be here, trust me, yes.


00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.860
- And then just being like, having to pick my jaw


00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.700
off the floor because like, you know, you had a rock star


00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.380
on the show. - A little rock star, yeah.


00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.340
And I think that that is one of the beauties of podcasting


00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.780
is that just like Python is kind of stretched outside


00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.500
of developer community and is kind of branched


00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.220
into data science and branched into automation


00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.540
and hopefully we'll see Python in more and more spaces,


00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.560
like we're seeing it in places that no one would expect,


00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.780
like on stage, like with Rivers Cuomo.


00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.620
What was that like?


00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.660
How did that happen?


00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.780
So Rivers has an assistant who coordinates a bunch of stuff,


00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.740
and send me a message and said,


00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.300
the assistant sent me a message.


00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.340
Rivers would like to be on the show.


00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.100
I'm like, "That is amazing."


00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.660
But you do understand it's a Python show,


00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.260
and I hadn't realized how much coding he had done.


00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.820
So I actually got to go out and spend some time with him


00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.980
when he was in Portland at a concert.


00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.580
>> Rub it in. Rub it in. I like it.


00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.780
>> We hung out a little bit. He's like, "Let me


00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.980
show you all the code I'm writing."


00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.220
And we just had a great time geeking out before the show.


00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.820
And after I saw him like,


00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.900
"You have to be on the show.


00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.480
What you're doing is so awesome.


00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.100
So yeah, he's doing legitimately cool stuff.


00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.360
>> I think now he's actually contributing


00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.500
to open source in Python as well.


00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.060
>> Yeah, I saw him and Brett Cannon going back forth on some work.


00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.220
>> Let's not talk about Brett Cannon. He's not here right now.


00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.540
He'll be back tomorrow.


00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.980
You can ask him questions about that at the Ask Me Anything.


00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.780
>> Anyway, it was really awesome to have him on the show.


00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.580
It was cool to have you there as well.


00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.740
That was a real popular one.


00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.140
That was in the vein of what you opened this conversation with.


00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.740
It was a bunch of little automation tools that don't count as


00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.960
like, "Hey, I built Instagram," but they're like,


00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.180
"This is a really amazing thing I built,


00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.740
even if it only took a day,


00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.900
it was super powerful."


00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.420
>> Yeah. All right.


00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.860
So, we're about halfway through the interview.


00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.940
We understand that people want to get to talk.


00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.360
So, what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead


00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.620
and raffle off a pair of Surface earbuds.


00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.460
Also, if you want to catch the talks,


00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.660
feel free to go do that.


00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.280
This will be on the podcast.


00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.820
Where can people find the podcast while


00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.800
you're looking for a number here?


00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.060
I don't want to be biased.


00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.540
>> It's going to influence me. I'm not even looking.


00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:40.860
>> Yeah.


00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.860
>> Find it at talkpython.fm or if you go to


00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.060
your any podcast player and just search for Talk Python.


00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:46.660
>> Okay.


00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.100
>> How do I read the number?


00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.620
>> Yeah. Just read the number. Read the number.


00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.260
>> All right. I wasn't paid that much for this.


00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.380
So the last numbers are 548.


00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.140
>> 548. Congratulations.


00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.820
>> Thank you.


00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.100
>> Congratulations.


00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.780
>> This portion of Talk Python to me is brought to you by Airplane.


00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.940
Airplane is the developer platform for building custom internal tools.


00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:16.460
Airplane lets you transform scripts, APIs, SQL queries, and more into powerful and


00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.980
shareable internal UI tools and workflows in minutes.


00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.220
You can use Airplane to build internal admin tools, host scheduled operations,


00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.180
share scripts and on-call runbooks, create multi-step human and loop


00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.900
workflows, and more. Unlike no-code, low-code platforms that address similar


00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.780
For use cases, Airplane is code-based.


00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.660
Everything you create in Airplane can be version-controlled, integrated with the rest of your code base,


00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.460
and extended using third-party libraries.


00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.580
The building blocks of Airplane are tasks, which are single or multi-step functions that


00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.860
anyone on your team can use.


00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:57.020
Airplane also offers views, which allow you to quickly create custom UIs and dashboards.


00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.780
Airplane includes enterprise-grade features out of the box, including permission settings,


00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.700
audit logs, self-hosting, approval flows, and more.


00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.380
You can sign up for a free account


00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.820
at talkpython.fm/airplane


00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.500
and start building complex workflows and UIs within minutes.


00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.340
So get started now by visiting talkpython.fm/airplane.


00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.640
That link is in your podcast player show notes.


00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.760
Thank you to Airplane for keeping Talk Python flying high.


00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:30.380
- Going back to that kind of that idea of like,


00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.580
hey, these are little tools and now they're being


00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.160
used with like super amazing people in the Python space.


00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.780
Have you heard of anybody getting into Python because of your show?


00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.660
>> I've heard of a lot of people getting into there.


00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.600
You know, when I started the show,


00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.800
going back to the beginning a little bit,


00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.540
when I started the show, I expected, well,


00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.580
I tried to think, well, who will listen to a show


00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.160
about the people making these frameworks in these libraries?


00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.800
It's got to be the most hardcore developers,


00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.480
the people who maybe wrote that library or really,


00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.800
really into it, right?


00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.640
>> Yeah.


00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.800
>> Sure, people like that listening, it's great.


00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.760
But there's a bunch of people who listen and they'll say things like,


00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.400
"I'm starting to understand what you all are talking about after six weeks."


00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.880
I'm like, "Why have you listened to six weeks and not know what I'm talking about?


00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.560
It's really a kind of an honor,


00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.120
but why would you do that?"


00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.400
What they do is they're using it as language immersion.


00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.260
If I just immerse myself in this community,


00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.800
soon enough I will be a Python person.


00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.960
Like if I moved to Brazil,


00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.380
maybe I could learn Portuguese if I just force myself to it.


00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.220
And there's a lot of people like that.


00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.440
So, there are a lot of people kind of on that journey.


00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.680
>> And then I guess in the same vein,


00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.880
has any of the feedback from the show that you've done,


00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.600
kind of gone into some of the other things that you do


00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.960
like Talk Python Training?


00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.480
>> Constantly. Constantly. I'll talk about something like,


00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.200
this might be interesting and everybody's,


00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.700
this is so amazing, so interesting,


00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.680
I want to learn more.


00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.340
I'm like, okay, well, maybe I should put


00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.180
some more effort into it, either have more shows


00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.580
or do a course or something like that.


00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.620
Yeah, absolutely.


00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.680
- Very cool.


00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.900
So, I guess I got one more question


00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.500
and then I'm gonna go, I'm gonna do the thing


00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.580
that you do at the end.


00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.540
- All right.


00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.460
- So you have, the show itself has kind of migrated.


00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.980
It started as a podcast only,


00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.140
and then I saw you start doing some videos,


00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.620
and then of course the courses were always


00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.260
kind of a big part of this.


00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.100
And now you've kind of integrated


00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.140
that live stream component to it as well.


00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.480
How was making that change from it being a,


00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.440
you know, pre-recorded, pre-talk,


00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.100
just you and the person you're interviewing,


00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.060
to now you have all of those things,


00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.980
but also a live audience listening over the internet?


00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.900
- Yeah, so smash the bell on YouTube, right?


00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.820
- Yeah, no.


00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.380
Like and subscribe, ring the bell, all that stuff.


00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.940
- Yeah, so seriously though,


00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.020
It was a big decision to make it a live show.


00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.020
And there were two things I was worried about.


00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.060
One is, will the guests, who used to just sort of


00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.100
call up one-on-one and say, "Let's have a conversation,"


00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.100
and then you'll edit it right?


00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.300
Because if I say something, "I'm really new to this,"


00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.100
and if you edit it, I think I can build up


00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.440
the confidence to be on there, like,


00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.780
"Oh, guess what? We're live streaming it to the world,


00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.440
"and it'll be written in ink on YouTube."


00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.680
You know, like, that's a different sort of deal.


00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.780
And for the most part, people haven't minded.


00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.980
At first, they're like, "I'm a little nervous."


00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.720
I'm like, "You know, it's fine, really.


00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.560
"You'll be fine.


00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.540
"No, it has been fine every time."


00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.500
- It's always like the first time you go on a live stream,


00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.720
you're like, "I don't know what to do.


00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.820
"Do I stare at the camera?


00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.180
"Do I look at the screen?"


00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.100
But then after that, they're like,


00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.360
"Oh, that was so fun engaging with the audience live


00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.460
"and seeing the comments and doing all that stuff."


00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.540
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.320
And from a logistics perspective,


00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.980
it's taken the effort down a little bit.


00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.940
Ironically, doing more,


00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.620
you'd think the live stream would add something,


00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.060
but we have people join the live stream and ask questions


00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.180
so we can kind of make the audience part of the show.


00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.620
I'm like, oh, I should have asked that question,


00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.360
but so and so in the live chat did.


00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.560
That helps.


00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.440
And then also, if it's already live,


00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.760
you don't have to edit it as much


00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.640
'cause it's kind of, you're a little more on focus


00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.200
because you're like, instead of like,


00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.680
hey, can we do that again or can we talk,


00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.520
or can we pause it?


00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.520
Like, you know we're live streaming, we're just gonna go.


00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.080
And it works out, but it kind of takes away


00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.200
some of the going back and fixing it up.


00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.080
But it's been really cool.


00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.920
I got into it, I think the real motivation to get into it


00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.040
was through a common friend of ours, Cecil Phillip.


00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:28.880
- Okay.


00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.960
- Yeah, and I interviewed him and Brian Clark


00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.760
about their live streaming, their developer stuff.


00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.600
- Okay.


00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.240
- And I was like, that's pretty cool what they're doing.


00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.080
How are you doing it?


00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.000
- The stuff over at Stripe that they're doing?


00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.200
- No, no, when he was at Microsoft.


00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.160
- Oh, okay.


00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.000
- Yeah.


00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.200
- Some of the like, ask the experts stuff that we do.


00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.040
- Yeah, that kind of stuff.


00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.000
- Well now we're doing it on the Microsoft YouTube channel.


00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.440
was like the YouTube at Microsoft developer.


00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.200
>> Right on.


00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:54.860
>> Cool.


00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.240
>> So anyway, he got me inspired watching what they were


00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.680
doing and got me using things like StreamYard.


00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.800
Yeah, it's real good.


00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.240
>> Very awesome. I love it. All right.


00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.280
So normally, you have some rapid fire questions at the end.


00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.360
So I have some rapid fire questions for you.


00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.400
We're at PyCon 2023.


00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.440
What was your first PyCon US?


00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.000
>> My first PyCon US,


00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.800
I think was in Portland,


00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.360
my hometown, in 2015.


00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.600
>> In 2015.


00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:26.560
2015, 2016. The irony was for that one year I was living in Germany, so I had to fly back, rent a hotel,


00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:32.680
stay a mile from my house, who someone else lived in it at the time because I was renting it, and then go to


00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.440
PyCon. So it was like a huge trip even though it was only two miles, three miles from my house.


00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.640
But it was a great time.


00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:43.240
What is the one conference talk that you always go back and and listen to or watch?


00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.840
Oh, the one conference talk. Oh boy.


00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.760
It's, I would say,


00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.360
the birth and death of JavaScript by Gary Bernhardt,


00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.800
which is, have you seen this?


00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.720
>> I think I've seen it once.


00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.040
>> It's, whenever I got to do


00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.520
a reference stuff with like low-level JavaScript and stuff.


00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.520
I mean, I know this is Python and all,


00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.760
but I think he gave that out of


00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.720
Python conference as a comedy thing,


00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.880
but it's also a really interesting history of


00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.440
JavaScript as both drama.


00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.340
I don't know. If you haven't seen it, it's worth checking out.


00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.060
>> All right. Two more rapid fire questions.


00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:28.540
What is your favorite addition or update to Python since you've been using it?


00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.580
>> I thought it was going to, I almost started like, "Oh, that's easy."


00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.500
But then there's two things that are really, really, really.


00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.140
>> Okay. You can do two.


00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.020
>> I'm going to do two. I'm going to take two.


00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.340
Async and await, type hints.


00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.980
>> Okay. Shout out to type hints.


00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.580
Type hints is-


00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.060
>> Shout out, yeah.


00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.060
>> f-strings are probably up there for me.


00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.060
F-strings are like in the top five.


00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.680
Type-ins are definitely up there.


00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.800
Walrus operator, we got a special place in my heart.


00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.520
>> You can take a site down.


00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.680
>> Take a whole website down in a matter of seconds with that.


00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.120
>> The Walrus operator is great.


00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.920
>> And then the last question is one that you normally ask,


00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.400
what is your favorite Python module or package?


00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.480
>> Yeah. What one?


00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.920
There's a bunch of interesting ones I run


00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.680
across with Python bytes like Brian Akin.


00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.240
We find a bunch there.


00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:20.240
- One that is really cool to me is Unsync.


00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.640
It just kind of unifies threading,


00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.600
multi-processing, and async and await


00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.200
in like a nice, cool way.


00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.480
I haven't been able to use it as much as I'd like,


00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.320
but I really like that one.


00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.320
And I just want to give a shout out to Latexify.


00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.160
- Okay.


00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.000
- Or Latexify?


00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.840
- You sure it's not Latexify?


00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.680
- Yeah, yeah.


00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.080
- You don't want the latex people,


00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.400
or sorry, latex people coming after us.


00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.240
- Let me re-say it.


00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.960
I meant Latexify.


00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.160
>> You can put a decorator onto a function.


00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:46.720
>> Okay.


00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.240
>> A Python function that does math inside and will


00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.920
write the symbolic mathematical


00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.880
representation of the Python code you wrote.


00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.880
>> Oh, that's really cool.


00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.840
>> It's insane.


00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.520
>> That's really cool.


00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.320
>> It can't do everything, but it'll be like, okay,


00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.000
well, that's an infinite sum from zero to infinity of this.


00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.160
How does it know? It's insane. Anyway.


00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.880
>> That's awesome. Well, Mike, again, thank you so much.


00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.880
Again, we've known each other for half a decade now.


00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.080
I hope we make it to a decade and


00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.880
more of working together and doing Talk Python stuff.


00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.960
And again, give people one more opportunity


00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.200
to know where they can learn more about the show.


00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.160
Yeah, if you're not subscribed, check it out,


00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.400
Talk Python.fm, or look for Talk Python in your podcast


00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:25.960
players.


00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.320
Really, really appreciate everyone.


00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.080
I mean, since I'm on this side of the microphone,


00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.560
I genuinely want to say thank you to everyone here,


00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.120
but everyone who listens to the show.


00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.480
It's been such an honor, and it's


00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.800
so cool to be able to do that.


00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.240
it's my full-time job now is running the podcast.


00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.240
>> That's awesome.


00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.840
>> When I started, I thought,


00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.680
"Oh, this would be a cool hobby on the side."


00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.080
Like I said, five episodes


00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.640
and I got to figure it out from there.


00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.200
It's just been such a great response from everyone


00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.320
and thankful every day.


00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.760
Thank you for working. I also,


00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.400
10 years, let's do it. It'll be easy.


00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.880
>> Yeah. We'll make it happen.


00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.080
Thank you for letting us host


00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.400
this event at the Microsoft booth.


00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.920
I think we actually have a gift for you as well.


00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.400
Aaron, do you have one of the-


00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.800
>> We have an extra pair of Surface earbuds.


00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.680
>> Oh, that's awesome.


00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.360
>> Especially for you.


00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.520
As a thank you one for doing this,


00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.880
but also a thank you for all that you


00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.040
do within the Python community.


00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.440
Everyone, this has been Michael Kennedy,


00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.400
I've been Jay Miller, this has been Talk Python Live.


00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.080
Let's give Michael a hand,


00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.520
wonderful hand for all that he's


00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.520
done for the past several years.


00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.840
>> Thank you everyone.


00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.880
>> This portion of Talk Python to me is brought to you by


00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.880
CodeCov from Sentry.


00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.400
Have you heard about CodeCov?


00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.320
They are the leading code coverage tool on the market,


00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.880
and they just joined Sentry,


00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.280
the error tracking and performance monitoring company


00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.000
that you know and love.


00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.320
CodeCov is the all-in-one code coverage reporting solution


00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.600
for any test suite,


00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.680
giving developers actionable insights


00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.640
to deploy reliable code with confidence.


00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.480
CodeCov is easy to set up.


00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.600
If you are already both a CodeCov and Sentry user,


00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.040
GitHub integration is even enabled automatically for you.


00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.200
You'll get coverage insights directly in your workflows.


00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.120
Code coverage pull request comments


00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.920
allow you to quickly analyze your PR's coverage


00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.320
and risk without leaving your workflow.


00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.880
It'll reduce the guesswork.


00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.080
You set up customizable quality gates


00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.080
and let your continuous integration do the rest.


00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.640
And CodeCov identifies where tests can help you


00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.000
avoid errors in production


00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.240
through their Sentry integration.


00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.080
If an error does occur,


00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.560
You'll even see code coverage details


00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.680
directly in your stack traces.


00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.240
So you can see the untested, partially or fully covered code


00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.320
that may be causing errors to help you fix your tests


00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.280
to avoid similar errors happening in the future.

Thank you to Sentry and CodeCov for supporting the show.


00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.900
- Hey Mario.


00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.180
- Hey Mike.


00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.940
- Great to see you here at the conference.


00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.060
- I'm happy to meet you.


00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.020
- Yeah, same here.


00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.860
And you know, first of all, before we get into it,


00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.500
Just tell people quickly who are you?


00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:34.860
Sure.


00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:35.380
Introduce yourself.


00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.600
Uh, my name's Mario.


00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:42.100
I live in Southern California and I write a blog called Python by night, which,


00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:47.000
you know, it's my hobby thing I do when the, you know, the kids asleep, when my


00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.700
wife is asleep, that's, that's what I do.


00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.380
Yeah.


00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.620
Some people play games.


00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.020
We write code or whatever.


00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:55.500
Awesome.


00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.580
So how's, how's the commerce going for you?


00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.340
Oh man, I'm having a great time.


00:25:59.340 --> 00:25:59.620
Are you?


00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.500
It's, it's my second Python.


00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:08.380
And this morning I gave a lightning talk about being either a fly on the wall or a busy worker


00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:13.740
bee. And I've been a busy worker bee. Yeah. You said the first time you came here, we were


00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.420
speaking at lunch. You said the first time you came here, you kind of just held back. You're


00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:22.780
kind of just observing and watching from the outside and you kind of dove in with your feet


00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:30.300
first. You know, I tend to be in the background most of the time, but yeah, I saw a tweet, I think


00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.180
asking for help over at the Python Software Foundation booth last year.


00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.700
- Includes beanbags, by the way.


00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.660
- It includes beanbags. Anyway, I went and helped out last year, met a lot of cool people.


00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:46.460
Then I just thought I should volunteer more. I got to meet a whole bunch of people I had only


00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:52.140
heard of or seen online, like some, to me, Python heroes. And I thought this was excellent. So this


00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.380
year I just dove in and tripled that or quadrupled that, I guess.


00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.700
- Yeah. Awesome. Seems like you're having a great time.


00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.740
- I'm having a great time.


00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:05.020
Awesome. What is your plan Ben? Some people try to go all the talks, some people hallway track it,


00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.660
some people just go to the parties. What's your plan?


00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:13.180
Ah, let's see. So I guess I was so intent on getting my tutorial, which was on Wednesday,


00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:18.700
the very first tutorial that I hadn't even made a plan. I just was so focused on that.


00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:24.220
Once I gave the tutorial, I was breathing easy, but I had already volunteered to help with the


00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:29.500
online platform. I was helping with the booth again. So that kind of kept me busy. I had planned


00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.860
to attend a couple of talks. I've only been to two maybe.


00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:38.380
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the plan was survive the tutorial and then figure it out.


00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.420
- And then figure it out.


00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.980
- How'd it go? It was HTMX, right? One of the fine technologies integrated with Python.


00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.380
- Fantastic. I feel like I've been talking about it all conference. I've talked to people


00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:54.140
individually. I had an open space about it. I talked about it at lunch. There's a real


00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:59.260
kind of a very palpable energy that people feel when they see what it can do.


00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.380
It's pretty exciting.


00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.100
- A bunch of people have been putting off learning JavaScript


00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.060
'cause they felt they have to.


00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.460
And you're like, wait, you don't actually have to do that.


00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.300
- You don't have to.


00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.120
- You have to.


00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.220
You really, keep your Python.


00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.140
- I haven't learned JavaScript, so.


00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:10.980
- Yeah, exactly.


00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.300
Not knocking on people who have and they're welcome to,


00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.180
but if you don't want to, you shouldn't be made to.


00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.520
- Yeah, it's not an either or, it's both and,


00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.780
but if you don't have to, you don't have to.


00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.460
- Yeah, the irony is even Node.js JavaScript,


00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.140
people like it because they don't have to write


00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.180
front-end JavaScript, they can write back-end JavaScript.


00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.020
- Right, yeah.


00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:33.060
in it for everyone. Yeah, so that's been mostly it. I love the hallway track. I love meeting people.


00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:38.340
I got a picture with Ned who, you know, he gave an awesome opening keynote.


00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:44.100
You know, all sorts of people that I'm meeting for the first time, other people I met last year.


00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.860
It's fantastic. Yeah, awesome. What's your big takeaways? What has stood out for you? I mean,


00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:52.660
there's a bunch of cool stuff back here behind us at the expo hall and other things you probably


00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.160
I saw talks like what stood out?


00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.660
What stood out?


00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:03.940
I think, you know, part of it is just coming, coming away from it from these


00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.860
past couple of years, I've been tough.


00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.720
Just not seeing a lot of people.


00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.240
And it is still kind of weird to see a lot of people.


00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.480
You feel that kind of hesitancy.


00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.680
People are still kind of feeling it out, but in spite of it all, I just think the


00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:25.400
Python community embraces people of all walks of life, no matter where you're coming from,


00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:32.200
even flies like myself who tend to be, you know, trying to masquerade as a bee. Even so,


00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:38.600
I feel like it's a safe space to be vulnerable, to learn a lot, and to teach a lot.


00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.920
- Yeah, absolutely. It's a very welcoming space and we're stronger together.


00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.000
That means we ought to take time to be together, right?


00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:45.720
- Yeah, correct.


00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.560
- Right.


00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.200
- Well, thanks for taking the time


00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.440
to share your experience.


00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.280
Great to see you.


00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.120
- All right. Awesome.


00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.940
Thank you.


00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.780
- Yeah, thanks.


00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.620
Hey Nick, how you doing?


00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.440
- Hey, hey Michael.


00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.480
- Hey, it's good to see you.


00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.320
- Good to see you too.


00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.000
- Yeah, in person this time.


00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.840
- Yes.


00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.480
- Last time it was on Python Bytes, right?


00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.080
- Yes, last time it was on Python Bytes.


00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.320
- Yeah, but here on PyCon.


00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.960
- Yes, PyCon 2023.


00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.480
- Yeah, so I just wanted to get together


00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.880
with a couple of folks, including you,


00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.720
and just ask, you know,


00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.000
what's your PyCon experience this year?


00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.840
How's it going?


00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.280
- It has been actually quite amazing.


00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.400
this year was the first time I gave a talk at PyCon.


00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.680
- Okay. - My first ever talk.


00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.600
- How did it go?


00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.520
- It went really well.


00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.640
I think I felt so encouraged by the Python community,


00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.280
people that came up to me and really appreciated


00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.640
what I had to say, and that made me feel more engaged


00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.640
and wanted me to do it again.


00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.080
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, fantastic.


00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.120
What was it on?


00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.920
- It was on improving the transportation networks


00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.500
using Python.


00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.400
As a data scientist for Trimble Transportation,


00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.120
I work in the transportation industry


00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.780
and they face a lot of problems


00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.860
in terms of reducing waste, optimizing their networks.


00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.980
And that's what my team at Tremble do day to day.


00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.440
So I needed to share with the Python community


00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.460
the kinds of things that we do


00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:05.600
and try to really get at the core of it


00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.660
and show that we use really a lot of Python to do it.


00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.800
- That sounds awesome.


00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.900
I'm just kind of wondering as you're telling me that,


00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.380
Do you get extra frustrated at traffic jams and stuff?


00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.220
'Cause you know behind the scenes


00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.300
how much it could be better.


00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.480
- I get frustrated at when my Amazon package


00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.320
doesn't come on time.


00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.160
- Yeah, okay.


00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.340
- So, but then again, I also feel a lot of empathy too


00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.500
because I know these drivers that are driving.


00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.340
It's a lot.


00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.780
- I think like half the traffic in the world


00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.380
might actually be Amazon drivers.


00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.700
(laughing)


00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.420
- But anyway, more, here hold on,


00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.620
let me move this real quick.


00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.460
There we go.


00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.900
Tell me about what you thought this year.


00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.140
It seems like the conference,


00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.540
people really happy to be back,


00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.020
but what stood out for you?


00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.300
- I think what stood out for me


00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.100
is the number of new attendees we still got.


00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:52.940
- Yeah, quite a few, yeah.


00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.260
- Yeah, quite a few, and it's pretty amazing


00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:00.260
because there were a lot of layoffs and economic struggles.


00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:05.420
And the conferences, it's not like you're all free,


00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.140
but people still came,


00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.660
and I think that's partly due to the PSF


00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.340
and the great work they do with their financial program.


00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.980
- Right, some of the scholarships, yeah.


00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.460
- Companies that we see here in the booth


00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.860
really understanding the importance


00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.420
of sending their people out here.


00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.060
So it's really great to see all those first-time attendees.


00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:24.900
Yeah.


00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.300
- Yeah, excellent.


00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.740
You said you're kind of trying


00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.220
the hallway track out this year?


00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.660
- Yes, that is a secret feature of PyCon.


00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.100
- The one thing not on YouTube.


00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.380
No live stream, none of that.


00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.220
- None of that.


00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.460
And I was at the keynotes with Ned Batch Elder


00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:45.680
And he really talked about talking to people because we have, and also like


00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.440
Marietta, the chair of Picon this year, talked about there's 2000 people here,


00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.920
like over 2000 people here, and this is the only time you're going to get to talk to them.


00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.360
Yeah.


00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.120
So I opted, made a conscious effort.


00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.360
Yeah, sorry.


00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.400
I got cut off there, but the hallway track.


00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:02.680
Yeah.


00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.400
The hallway track.


00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.320
And Ned talked about talking to people.


00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:04.500
Yeah.


00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.120
Ned talked about, Ned and Marietta talked about talking to people.


00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.800
So I made a conscious effort to try and interact with the fellow people that are


00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.400
walking around this hallways and this expo booth and does get into on this.


00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.560
And I really got a lot of like really nice interactions.


00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.200
I met up with old friends, people I met at PyCon, but we're going to do


00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.980
activities together and all that stuff.


00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:27.880
So it's been really, really, really like fruitful.


00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.240
Yeah.


00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:28.680
Awesome.


00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.920
Well, great to run into you.


00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.720
Same.


00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.440
Likewise.


00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:32.680
Yeah.


00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:32.880
Yeah.


00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.240
And thanks for, thanks for taking the time to talk to everyone and sharing your,


00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.040
your experience.


00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.880
- Bye guys.


00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.720
- Bye.


00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.540
- Bye.


00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.380
- Hey Sean.


00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.220
- Hey Mike, how's it going?


00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.240
- It's fantastic to see you again,


00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.080
and in person, imagine that.


00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.840
- I know, first time in a few years, it's been great.


00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.240
- It has, since the before times.


00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.200
- I know, right?


00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.640
- Since the before times.


00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.920
But here we all are back together at PyCon,


00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.240
and yeah, it's great.


00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.080
Before we get into it,


00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.640
just tell people quickly about yourself.


00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.480
- Sure.


00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.300
- Fellow podcaster.


00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.320
- Sure, so my name's Sean Tyber.


00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.120
I'm a senior cloud engineer at Mondelēz International,


00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.200
which nobody knows except for we make all of the Oreos


00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.720
and the Nilla wafers and Cadbury chocolates,


00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.960
all the good stuff.


00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.400
And we also do a lot of really cool stuff in the cloud.


00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.600
So I'm also the co-host of the Teaching Python podcast.


00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.960
I feel like I'm missing my right arm


00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.200
'cause Kelly couldn't make it this time.


00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.040
- Shout out to Kelly.


00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.600
Kelly, you should be here, we miss you.


00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.720
- Yeah, well, we'll get her next year.


00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.920
- Yes, exactly.


00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.400
- Yeah, and just here running the education summit


00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.880
on Thursday and attending the rest of the conference


00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.080
and enjoying it like any other Pythonista.


00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.640
- How was the education summit?


00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.480
- It's amazing.


00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.600
We had some wonderful speakers,


00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.520
educators coming from all over the country,


00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.960
from all over the world.


00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.840
We had people speaking from as far away as South Korea


00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.760
at the education summit, and it's the one time of year


00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.800
when people who are teaching computer science


00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.580
and teaching Python specifically get a chance


00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.600
to come together and talk about what they do


00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.440
with other people.


00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.080
It's just a unique experience.


00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:53.920
- Yeah, it's excellent.


00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.820
And if you're teaching actual students,


00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.440
it's hard to get away, right?


00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.540
You've got the school year,


00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.000
and you've got a structure on that, so it's a big deal.


00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.640
- Yeah, it's been a great experience.


00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.560
We did some workshops talking about the impact


00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:10.120
generative AI on education, some of the implications of that, and just, you know,


00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.120
try to figure out what it's gonna look like in the future.


00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.880
So what did you decide ChatGPT is gonna do to our education system?


00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.760
Well, we still have way more questions than we have answers, but we also are looking at it


00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.400
from the lens of there have been other tools that have transformed education.


00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.200
Calculators were supposed to ruin the teaching of math, and yet we figured that


00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.320
out. So we're confident we can do the same here.


00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.880
Same thing for search and the internet. Also kind of broke it, right? How's your, how are you


00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.880
going to test if people know history if they can just type in when was the war


00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.080
of 1812? Right and we what we found is that we these are skills that we can


00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.800
teach we can teach students how to search more effectively how to find


00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:50.000
things how to solve problems and I think with generative AI it's about how to


00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.220
evaluate what's happening what you're asking for and making sure that it is


00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.960
appropriate to the problem you're trying to solve. How do you ask your questions


00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.520
and then how do you assess whether it's real what it said? Exactly. All right well


00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.280
what stood out for you at the show so far how's it been? I mean it's the people


00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:08.360
Like always, it's the people getting to see everyone, getting to have those great conversations,


00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:14.200
to sit down and have lunch together and talk about things. And just, I find myself looking


00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.560
at everyone's badges to figure out where they're coming from and what kind of cool work they're


00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:23.240
doing. And I'm just curious about what, how they're using Python and how I could connect


00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.880
with them and make something cool happen together. - It's always surprising. You run into such,


00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.680
such cool people. And that is my favorite part as well. It's just kind of the,


00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:43.240
Honestly, the hallway track, I know, not dissing the speakers, I'm looking forward to those talks on YouTube, but it's the parts that are not recorded and are spontaneous that really make it worth coming to, I think.


00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:54.920
That's true. And I've been enjoying the talks too. There's been some really phenomenal talk tracks this year. We're just seeing, I think, a new wave of energy coming out of the pandemic.


00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.420
Yeah.


00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.960
And I can't wait to go to Pittsburgh next year and do this all again.


00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.040
- I know, that'd be awesome.


00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.400
Well, thanks for taking the time to share your experience.


00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.480
- It's my pleasure, Michael, thanks.


00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.320
- You bet, bye.


00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.140
- Bye.


00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:05.980
- Hey, Chris.


00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.820
- Hey, Mike, how are you doing today?


00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.640
- Really good, really good.


00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.920
Enjoying PyCon, how about you?


00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.760
- I am having an absolute blast here.


00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.960
- It's always fun, isn't it?


00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.960
- Oh, this is my favorite conference.


00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.360
The energy, the vibe, the people,


00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.960
the willingness to share is bar none


00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.840
the best conference that I've ever attended.


00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.680
- Yeah, it's--


00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.500
- And I've been to a lot.


00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.560
- Yeah, I know you have.


00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.160
It really is unique in that regard.


00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.160
Tell people quickly about yourself.


00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.040
- Hey everybody, my name is Chris Williams.


00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.160
I am the host of the vBrownBag podcast.


00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.080
I'm a dev rel manager for HashiCorp and an AWS hero.


00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.560
- Yeah, awesome.


00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.440
And I've been on your BrownBag a few times.


00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.280
That's been very fun.


00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.560
- You're a friend of the vBrownBag show.


00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.160
I am a friend of Talk Python.


00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.000
- That is right.


00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:53.840
Yeah, we're all friends here.


00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.440
It's amazing. - Yay!


00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.320
- So, how's this conference going for you?


00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.140
How is it in 2023?


00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.660
- It's been going really well.


00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:05.400
I'm glad that there's a bit more energy than last year.


00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.480
There's more interest.


00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.700
It's been, I think people are just exuberant


00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.540
to be out of the house and meeting new folks


00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:18.940
and getting back into the vibe of the before times.


00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.420
- Yeah, we miss people, right?


00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.340
- Yeah, exactly.


00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.860
- Zoom is fine.


00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.020
- But it's not a patch on actually hanging out with folks.


00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.460
- It's not a replacement, that's right.


00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.660
- Yeah, totally.


00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.780
So what's your game plan here?


00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.060
Are you on hit all of us talks?


00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.340
Are you on hallway track?


00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.140
Are you trying to get all the swag?


00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.060
What's going on here?


00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.660
- So I'm actually changing it up a little bit this year.


00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.340
I love the hallway track and meeting folks.


00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:46.220
So I found an entire contingent of people in Boston


00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.440
that I didn't even know were out there.


00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.740
The keynotes have been,


00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.620
I am now trying to find ways to improve my public speaking.


00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:01.260
So paying attention to truly good folks like James and Ned


00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:05.140
and their keynotes were masterclasses in presentation


00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.820
and humorous pauses and things like that.


00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.380
And so I'm furiously scribbling down notes,


00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.220
like, "Oh, that sounded great,


00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.980
"I'm gonna try that." - Ah, yeah.


00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.900
Yeah, you can watch the talks,


00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.180
or you can attend the talks, or you can study the talks.


00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.580
- Yes. - And whenever I go there,


00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.100
as somebody who's done a ton of public speaking,


00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.500
I'm like, "Oh, that was nice."


00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.460
I don't know if people caught that,


00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.140
but they appreciated that if they didn't.


00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.480
- Yeah. - So yeah, that's.


00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.960
So I'm doing the keynotes as a study session.


00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.720
I am doing the hallway track.


00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.680
Generally, if something is going to be recorded,


00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.400
I will catch it after the fact.


00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.880
So I tend to not do them unless there's


00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.680
something that I want to talk to the presenter about on the spot.


00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.640
Then I will tend that.


00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.440
But I'm just trying to catch up with some friends.


00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.280
A good friend of mine spent an inordinate amount of time


00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.160
teaching me new things in Python over the past couple of days.


00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.280
He's a contributor.


00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.580
And he was showing me some stuff that, as a newbie developer,


00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.940
I'm kind of too dumb to know the right questions to ask.


00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.220
And I know that people don't like saying you're too dumb.


00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:07.980
Nobody's too dumb.


00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.060
There's no dumb questions.


00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.380
But well, you do need to sort of find your way.


00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.740
The questions that I don't know I need to ask yet.


00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:15.540
Yeah, sure.


00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:19.460
So yeah, it's just been really good to catch up with folks,


00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.060
learn new things, and absorb as much as humanly


00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.540
possible in three days.


00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.140
Yeah, it is tiring, but it's fun.


00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:27.980
Converse is fun.


00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:28.820
After parties are fun.


00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:29.640
- Yep, yep.


00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.820
- Yeah, really, really good stuff.


00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.860
So, thanks.


00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:33.700
Before I let you out here,


00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.060
what in Python are you excited about right now?


00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.740
- So, I'm gonna be checking out the new releases in 3.12.


00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.660
They were making some announcements on f-strings


00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.760
that I need to dig into.


00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.020
Like, we're making f-strings better.


00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.600
I'm like, okay, wow.


00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.100
So, I'm gonna be doing a lot of Googling


00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.700
after everything is said and done to figure it out.


00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.780
And as a content creator myself,


00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.220
I'll be spending a lot of time parsing through the stuff that I've been making.


00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:02.420
And, and, you know, just finding new ways to, reach out to people.


00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:06.140
I mean, I don't know about you, but for me, this whole experience is a great way


00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.900
to find interesting people to talk to.


00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.460
Like you could have people on V brown bag, right?


00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.600
There's a, there's a bunch of resumes.


00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.020
They didn't know they submitted to you.


00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:14.820
Oh, yeah, absolutely.


00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.100
Yeah.


00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.540
I have, I have been, I've been scribbling down names and, my, my little, my


00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:23.300
My little notepad on my phone is filling up furiously as I find people to pester after


00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.300
this.


00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.300
Awesome.


00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.300
Well, thanks for taking your time to share your thoughts.


00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.300
Thanks, Mike.


00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.300
Appreciate it.


00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.300
Yeah, you bet.


00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.300
Bye.


00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.300
Hey, Ray.


00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.300
Hey.


00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.300
How are you doing?


00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.300
I'm doing wonderful.


00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.300
Great to meet you.


00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.300
You as well.


00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.300
Yes, yes, yes.


00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.300
Thank you.


00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.300
Tell people quick who you are, a bit about yourself.


00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.300
Let's see.


00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.300
So I'm Ray McLendon.


00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.460
I'm actually a data scientist at the Kansas City Fed.


00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.500
I mostly work in natural language processing, that kind of fun stuff.


00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.500
Yeah.


00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:53.020
really awesome. Yeah. So just talking to people about their PyCon experience and


00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.020
you know, how many times you've been here?


00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.260
So this is my second PyCon.


00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:57.700
Okay.


00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.420
My first one was last year.


00:41:59.420 --> 00:41:59.660
Yeah.


00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.340
Sort of like right on the back of everybody getting back together from the pandemic.


00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:07.580
Yeah. So I'm not sure how representative your experience was last time. It was a


00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.220
little, a little different, but how was it this year?


00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.540
Oh, I'm really enjoying it.


00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.020
I actually gave a tutorial this year.


00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.060
Oh you did? What was it on?


00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.820
feature engineering is for everyone.


00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.460
>> Uh-huh.


00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:23.060
>> So trying to just share our knowledge of feature engineering,


00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.460
I co-presented that with a co-worker of mine, Leah.


00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.900
Yeah, it was fantastic. We had a great time.


00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.460
>> Yeah. You had a good experience doing it?


00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.380
>> Absolutely. Looking forward to doing it again.


00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.660
>> Cool. What library is that,


00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.220
like PyTorch or what was it?


00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.260
>> That's really interesting. So it was a mix.


00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:43.700
There was some exploration with YData profiler.


00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:44.660
>> Okay.


00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.660
And then there was building various features.


00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:54.160
Some of it was kind of just using pandas or NumPy and Scikit-learn.


00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.660
We use some of the libraries for feature engineering that are built into that.


00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.660
So it's a mix of libraries.


00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.660
Cool. Well, what stood out to you so far this year?


00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:10.660
Well, I guess the interesting part that I did was I went to OpenSpaces.


00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.660
I didn't do that the previous year.


00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.420
and I went to one this year around civic data.


00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.060
So that was really fascinating.


00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.100
- Yeah, yeah.


00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:21.540
- Enjoyed the real community vibe


00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:24.180
and learning about, I guess, honestly,


00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.780
how difficult it is to get your hands


00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.180
on civic data, quite frankly.


00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.500
- Yeah, I can imagine that it is,


00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.500
but we can complain a lot about the government and systems,


00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.180
and that's easy to do, but at the same time,


00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.100
we have all this technology and all this data


00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.660
and people can really put in, make a difference.


00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.000
I see actually the US digital services have a booth over there.


00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:45.300
Right.


00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.180
And that's kind of like trying to bring people in from industry to say like,


00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.180
look, you built Instagram.


00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:54.220
Now, could you help us build something else for the government?


00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.740
We could, so people won't complain.


00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.980
It's kind of cool actually.


00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:57.340
Yeah.


00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.820
So they were at the civic data group and I hate to say it.


00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:05.180
I had never heard of the US digital service before, so I was really excited


00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.060
to hear about the efforts and the work that they're doing, including some of


00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:11.260
and like best practices guides around UX and UI


00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.100
that they even provide.


00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.020
- Yeah, it's very cool service.


00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:19.020
I interviewed David on Talk Python years ago,


00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.900
but maybe I should talk to him again.


00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.380
But anyways, it's a cool service.


00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.140
So what stood out to you this year?


00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.820
- Strangely enough, I come to PyCon,


00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.620
I expect some really technical talks, to be honest.


00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.340
That's an expectation.


00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.900
It was really the keynote from the first day with Ted,


00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.620
where he kind of broke down like communication.


00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.120
- Yeah.


00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.820
- That strangely, that was the thing


00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.000
that stood out the most to me.


00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.940
- I've heard so many good things from his keynote


00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:46.980
and I was doing, preparing for a live event


00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.280
that started the minute it ended,


00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.900
so I couldn't be there like,


00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.340
but I'm gonna watch it on YouTube and I'll check it out.


00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.860
So cool. - Absolutely.


00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.280
- Yeah, you've been walking around


00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.940
doing the hallway track a little bit as well


00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.140
and joining me and people?


00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.840
- That's right, yeah, I sure have.


00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.000
I've bumped into a few folks


00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.720
and we've been throwing ideas around.


00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.220
I'm really big into the whole GPT thing.


00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.140
- Oh, it's crazy.


00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.580
- Yeah, it's pretty wild.


00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.100
So it's been interesting to see some folks


00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.500
that are really thinking deeply about ethics


00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.980
and security in that space


00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.860
and giving me new ideas to bring back.


00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.700
- Yeah, cool.


00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.580
There's a lot of ML and a lot of AI stuff


00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:23.420
around here this year.


00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.660
So, all right.


00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.780
Well, thanks for being on the show.


00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.020
