00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.780
Writing good, clean code and having a deep working knowledge of Python is critical to your success as a Python developer.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:12.780
But if you look at all those who have truly excelled in their career, it's often because they bring something in addition to just coding skills.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.120
We all want to be the most successful and satisfied versions of ourselves, but that's much easier said than done.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.800
That's why I'm excited to introduce you to John Sonmez.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.660
He's had a brilliant career as a software developer, and he wrote a book to help all of us do the same.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:35.080
It's called Soft Skills, the software developer's life manual, and it's packed full of concrete, practical steps that you can take to stand out in the tech industry.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.320
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 71, recorded August 10th, 2016.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:11.940
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.080
This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.560
Keep up with the show and listen to past episodes at talkpython.fm, and follow the show on Twitter via at talkpython.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.100
This episode is brought to you by Hired and SnapCI.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.820
Thank them for supporting the show on Twitter via at hired underscore HQ and at snap underscore CI.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.060
Hey, everyone. Thanks for listening to this episode.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.460
I have a quick Kickstarter update before we get to the interview with John.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.800
Many of you asked about this crazy student reward that I said we're going to reveal and talk about when we get far enough along in the Kickstarter.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.380
Well, it's time to reveal the crazy student reward.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.120
So the entire premise of my Kickstarter course is to help you guys successfully build and launch new online businesses,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.240
either as a side business or completely as a full-time endeavor.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.060
So here's the crazy goal.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.960
If we reach $40,000 for the Kickstarter, and we're not that far away,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.280
we will fund at least one business that has successfully launched within six months of the course going live.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.580
We'll pick a student and we'll give them $1,000 cash to help them promote and launch their business.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.040
If we make it a little bit farther to $50,000, we'll do this for three students.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.580
We hope that you guys who are back in the Kickstarter love this reward.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.940
It's not a million dollars of VC money, but hey, if you can get two extra weeks to stop consulting

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.160
and just focus on launching your business and get it out there and be successful, we'd love to be part of that.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.240
So if you want to check out the Kickstarter, people seem to really like what we're building there.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.100
It's at talkpython.fm/launch.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.980
Now let's talk to John about software careers.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.340
Hey, John, welcome to the show.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.860
Thanks. I'm glad to be here.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.580
Yeah, I'm really glad to have you here.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.840
I'm a big fan of your work and I've recommended people check out your books and some of your videos when they've asked for career advice.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.020
But after recommending your work a bunch of times, I'm like, you know, why don't I just have John on the show and we can, you know, really dive into it.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:18.460
And my goal, my hope is that a lot of the listeners out there, we can help them boost their career, get that job they're looking for, something like that.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.440
Yeah, that sounds like a plan. Let's do it.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.540
Awesome. All right. So before we get into what you have in your book and some of the other stuff you have going on to achieve that goal, let's just start at the beginning.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.980
What's your story? How did you get into programming?

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.420
Ah, gosh, let's see. How did I get into programming?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:49.020
I think, you know, probably way back when I was a kid, I think, you know, the first thing that I remember that really got me inspired to program was going into a, like a survey course in maybe like junior high school or elementary school where we had some Apple IIEs.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.300
And this is the first time I saw one of those computers and we're learning the basics of programming and basic.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.180
And I remember having this floppy disk with me and I was like, I was just so fascinated by this idea that you could actually program a computer.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.680
I mean, I didn't even really know much about computers at that point, but it just, it just seems so intriguing to me.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.300
So I remember having this disk where I had all these little silly programs that I wrote and, you know, I started to have these aspirations of,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.520
of building games, of building, building something with it.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.740
I think I didn't really have an opportunity, you know, not, not too many people have an Apple IIe.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:31.700
So I didn't really have an opportunity to do much with that until a few years later when, you know, home PCs were becoming more, more of a thing.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.220
And I remember finding, you know, getting, getting a home PC.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.300
And the first thing kind of that I did when my dad brought home the home PC was I found QBasic on there.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.720
And I started playing around with that.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.160
No, that's awesome.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:58.000
You started out with this exploratory experience with basic and QBasic, you know, and how did you go from that into, I want to make this my career.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.320
This is super interesting and actually getting into programming for real.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.120
Yeah.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.680
So I think from there, you know, once I had gotten a home computer, I was just, I just hooked.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.740
I was, I wasn't programming at that point, but I was, I loved computer games.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.320
I had been, you know, playing Atari, Nintendo, all that stuff.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:23.160
And here was this, this computer that even more powerful, I remember playing, you know, Sierra online or Sierra games and all that.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.380
And I liked the idea of, of creating my own game.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.260
And that's, that's kind of something that I think really drove me.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:42.260
I remember spending a lot of time online playing a mud, these multi-user dungeons, kind of the precursor to the EverQuest and the WoW, where it's just a text-based game.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.180
Those were great.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.020
Which ones, which ones did you play?

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.480
Do you recall?

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.480
Oh gosh.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.460
Like, well, there was, I remember playing just through Telnet, right?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.900
Oh yeah.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.540
I had this dial-up BBS, right?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.040
And it actually had internet access.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.460
So you dial up to the BBS and then you could actually get Telnet access from the BBS system.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:08.560
And, and then I would find mud listings and I'd Telnet into Deku muds and all the different variations.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.280
I can't even remember.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.280
I didn't like LP muds that much.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.940
Yeah, that's cool.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.560
I remember my friends and I played this one called Shadow's Edge.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.820
I think it was pretty, pretty popular.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.240
I, those, those were really interesting days.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:27.800
Those were the days when William Gibson was talking about cyberspace and the world seemed like, even though it's so bizarre, it was so basic and text-based.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.440
And yet it seemed almost like there was more possible.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.440
Exactly.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.060
Yeah.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.100
How funny, huh?

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.320
Yeah.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:41.500
I just remember, you know, sitting at the terminal, you know, and, and thinking, imagine, you know, there's, there's Telnet and then I was like, and then there's gopher protocol.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.620
And I was like, just thinking like, gosh, it's so much, it's, it felt like this cyberspace to me.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.160
It really did.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.480
It felt like there's this huge universe out there that I can access via text.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.940
And it was awesome.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:04.780
And I remember even playing a mud that was in, there was this BBS system called Major BBS and so they had this major mud that was part of the BBS system.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:16.200
And, and actually, you know, it's kind of funny about that is that that was perhaps the most complex program I had written at that time was I remember being in high school and I couldn't play the game all day.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.120
But I found this, this program called Terminate.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.160
It was a, to connect to the BBS, I forget what they, what they call it, a client essentially.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.060
And it was programmable.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:33.020
And so I wrote a script to play the game while I was at school.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:39.060
So basically, you know, I'd run this script and while I was at school, it would connect to the BBS.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.700
It would go in, log into the game.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.780
It would run around and, you know, kill things.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.880
And so I'd be gaining experience and getting levels.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.320
And then every like hour or two, the BBS would disconnect you.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.440
So it would handle that and redial in and, and keep trying to dial in until it got, got in.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:04.260
And, and so that was, yeah, that, those days were just, it was, it was like being a pioneer, you know, it's like there was, it was such a magical time, I think.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:13.760
And that's what really, really got me interested in technology and development is like, I wanted to be part of, I wanted to be creating that world that intrigued me so much.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.740
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.100
You know, you're sort of destined to be a programmer when you start solving your problems in code.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:24.380
Even if your problems are, I'm really tired of these sort of mundane tasks I got to do in a mud to level up.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:24.560
Right.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.040
Exactly.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.700
Yeah.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.440
Nice.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:34.440
So maybe let's talk a little bit about like the, your career in terms of your experiences and so on.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.920
So that people get a sense of what, where you're coming from, I guess.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.080
So you started out as like a lot of us do as a full-time employee.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.480
Is that right?

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.160
That's correct.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.380
Yeah.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:43.780
Yeah.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.160
I started out with a lot of different jobs.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:52.680
You know, I think I went to school to Boise State University for a year.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:09:04.920
I almost dropped out of programming because computer science, I went, I remember my first Java class and it was like, we're hand rolling iterators and doing sorting algorithms.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.360
And I was like, this is not, this is not what I signed up for.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.120
This is not fun.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.580
If this is my life, if this is what programming is, I don't want to do it.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.880
Like I want to make games.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.980
There is no game.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:25.600
There is no fun in like implementing a database engine without conditionals or some bizarre, you know, homework exercise you get, right?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.300
Exactly.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.600
So I was kind of distraught and it was, it was hard.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.280
It was boring.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:37.040
And I remember, you know, during my summer vacation, I got the summer job working as a tester at HP.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:45.520
And strangely enough, the guy that interviewed me, he was like, one of the interview's questions, I kid you not, was, have you played EverQuest?

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.580
And I was like, no, I'm not really.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.080
He's like, would you be interested in playing EverQuest?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.860
And I was like, well, yeah, definitely.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.780
It's like a graphical mud.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.100
Yeah.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.640
Hell yeah.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.680
And so I think that's why I got hired.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.800
That's awesome.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.820
That's a really cool benefit of the job.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.060
Yeah.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:01.660
Very nice.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.300
Yeah.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.800
So these guys, you know, that they were all into EverQuest.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.140
But I, I, essentially that was my first job, like real job.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.520
And I ended up, you know, I was a tester, but I ended up like figuring out ways I could do development.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.100
I learned PostScript, the printer language, PCL.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.640
And I started modifying the scripts they're using for, for running the tests.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.880
And I ended up not going back to school because I was making enough money.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:38.240
I got a couple of promotions where I was like, well, you know, when I get out of school, I was hoping to make, like, I don't know, at that time, I think I was hoping to make like maybe $40,000 or $50,000 a year.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.660
And that's what I was making at my job, my summer job.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.680
So I just stayed there.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:50.820
And then from there, I ended up moving into a full-time development position at HP.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.400
And I moved around a lot.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.780
I did a lot of consulting and contracting.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:02.880
I worked for Xerox, small startup companies that went under as I moved around.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:11.340
I pretty much moved around the country as a, you know, basically as an, either a full-time employee directly for a company or a contractor,

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:23.540
which was essentially, you know, more of the, not, not the freelancer contractor route, but the staff augmentation where, you know, you're paid an hourly rate by, and you're working for a single company.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.100
But I pretty much did that for, for a pretty good bulk of my career.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:28.780
Right.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.200
And I think, you know, that's, those are great jobs.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.800
And they're, they're very interesting.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.040
And what we're going to talk about totally applies to that as well.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.460
But since then, you've gone to do some more independent things, right?

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:48.420
Like, one thing that really blew my mind is you said that you had created a number of online courses.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.700
And that number and the timeframe really blew my mind.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.420
Like, as me creating my online courses for my, my training company, I know how much work it is.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.900
Can you talk a bit about your, your online course venture you went on?

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.500
Oh, sure.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:00.800
Yeah.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:13.360
So at some point, you know, to kind of, to kind of cut the fast forward to the, in the story, like, you know, after being an employee for, for some time, I started to get some entrepreneurial type of ideas in my head.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.420
And so I started to run into some people that were not doing the regular nine to five thing.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.780
And so, and different things changed my life.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.660
I finally got to this point where I call it like, I think the transition was, was becoming a finisher.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.720
Okay.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:33.320
You know, instead of just starting things and not finishing them, I had a real good dedication that I started to develop of, I finished what I start.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.420
And that made a huge difference in my life.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.400
And I got some opportunities.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.940
I started the Simple Programmer blog, which was just my personal blog at the time.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.320
And opportunities kept coming my way from it.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.720
And one of those opportunities was from this company called Pluralsight.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.540
And they had mostly .NET training.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:57.740
But I was doing, I had just built an Android app and an iOS app as I was playing around with that.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:02.480
And they said, hey, you know, do you want to teach a course on Android?

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.720
Do you think you could teach a course on Android?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And I thought, well, you know, I've never taught an online course.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.460
I don't even know how to record a course.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.260
But sure, I'll, you know, submit a demo.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.000
And so I submitted a demo.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.320
And they said, oh, this is great.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.520
Yeah, let's, let's do it.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.980
We'll, we'll commission you for a course.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.540
And so I did that course.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.420
And that course went really well.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.840
And, you know, I got my first royalty check.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:29.600
And I think at that point, it was maybe, I mean, they paid me like a few thousand dollars to do the course or something like that.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.160
And I got the first royalty check.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.280
And I think it was like a, maybe like three or $4,000, maybe $5,000.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.120
And I thought, wow, I'm getting paid for work that I did before.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.780
Yeah.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.480
Like, and I'll keep getting paid for this work.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.800
This is awesome.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.340
There's, there's, there's something here, right?

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.600
So I said, man, I can, I need to take advantage of this opportunity as much as I can.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.220
So I said, what other courses do you need?

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.160
And they said, well, do you know anything about iOS?

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.820
And I said, a little bit, but in two weeks, I'll know a whole lot more.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.340
So I studied hard, you know, started really learning as much as I could, crunching it, all the, everything that I could learn about it.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.620
And I put out an iOS course.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.800
And then I asked, what other courses do you need?

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.280
And, you know, I ended up building quite a few courses.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.960
And then as I started building these courses, I started building a system.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.580
I started getting better at it and faster at it.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.280
At the same time, I started, you know, the royalty checks were increasing.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.760
And I started to realize, like, there's a really huge opportunity here.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.200
And there's a lot of authors already, but they're not taking advantage of this opportunity.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.440
You know, they're, they're taking like three months to put out a course and stuff.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:40.460
I got to figure out how to do this fast, how to do this efficient, and how to have a high quality course.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:54.140
And so over the, I think over, what is it, like, gosh, it ended up being over a three-year period, I put out 55 full-length courses that are around, you know, on average three to five hours in length.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:59.780
And I basically, for, gosh, I saw this as my ticket out.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:07.260
I saw this as a way, as I started doing the numbers, I was like, okay, if I can do this, if I can hold down my full-time job.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:15.380
And I remember having this conversation with my wife because she was, she was on board with me doing the pluralside thing, but she wasn't sure about, you know, how much time I was going to spend.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.220
But I told her, I was like, okay, look, here's my plan.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.020
I'm going to do my full-time job.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.660
And every night I'm going to work like four or five hours every night.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.940
You're not going to see much of me.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:31.000
Every weekend I'm going to be working, but I'm going to do this for like a year or two years and we'll be set for life.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.480
Right.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.640
That was, you know, I had done the math and this, this worked out.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:45.800
And so my life for, for two years was basically just, I mean, I don't want to say it was hell, but it was, there was nothing, there was no recreation in there and no vacation.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.060
It was, it was the grind, right?

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.020
It was, it was grind.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.160
But I worked and I worked hard.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.680
I was putting out blog posts and still running my business at the same time.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.640
And I mean, I was working probably 80, 90 hour weeks for probably two years.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:07.180
And I ended up putting out maybe something like, I think it was 20 courses or so over that time, doing it part time.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:13.480
And then after that had happened, my checks got to the point where I could quit my full-time job.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.160
So I quit my job.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.060
I told my boss, I was like, I love working here, but it just doesn't make sense.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.560
My, you know, I'm able to make enough money from royalty check.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.740
That's more than, than the salary you're paying me.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.020
And he said, well, you should have quit earlier.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.140
And so I went for one year.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.160
I did full-time.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.440
I said, okay, what I'm going to do this year is I'm just going to full-time create Pluralsight courses.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.040
And aside from doing blog posts and YouTube videos and stuff, that's my focus.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:48.520
So I went independent and I created, in that year, my goal was to create 30, 30 Pluralsight courses.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.740
I created 36 Pluralsight courses.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:58.380
I was actually finished by November and, and yeah, that was, and then, and then I actually stopped doing them.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.500
Did you take December off?

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.940
I did.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.440
I did.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:03.800
Yeah.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.760
I took that off.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:10.820
But what I tend to do now is like every year I tend to work like nine months of the year and then take, take two to three months off.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.280
Yeah, that's cool.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.820
Or go sort of off, you know, however off you can be owning a business.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.760
Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.000
You can't really entirely walk away and just put it down like you can at a regular job.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:34.040
This portion of Talk Python is brought to you by Hired.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.080

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.740
Take it from one of Hired's users who recently got a job and said,

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:50.040
I had my first offer on Thursday after going live on Monday and I ended up getting eight offers in total.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.500
I've worked with recruiters in the past, but they've always been pretty hit and miss.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.340
I tried LinkedIn, but I found Hired to be the best.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.420
I really like knowing the salary up front.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.800
Privacy was also a huge seller for me.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.480
Sounds awesome, doesn't it?

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.480
Well, wait until you hear about the sign-in bonus.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.900

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.800
Use the link Hired.com slash Talk Python To Me and Hired will double the signing bonus to $2,000.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.600
Opportunity's knocking.

Visit Hired.com slash Talk Python To Me and answer the door.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:33.440
But one thing that I think is worth pointing out at your story, and it mirrors my story as well,

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:40.840
is you didn't decide, hey, I've got this great idea and I've got two months savings in the bank.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.600
I'm going to quit my job and go build the idea.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.280
You sort of grew it on the side until it was clearly not a risky move.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.240
And I did the same thing with my podcast and my online courses.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:58.340
I could more or less comfortably live on the various revenue sources.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:05.320
And when I told my wife, look, I'm going to quit my job and go focus on this thing that I think is way more valuable to the community,

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:11.480
way more valuable to us, it wasn't like, oh, you better get this right because it was already working.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.320
Exactly.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.500
Yeah, yeah, it's really interesting.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:20.420
I've got two kind of thoughts on that, like two things that are kind of almost contradictory information.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:26.480
But as a developer, having a mortgage, having a family or whatever, and having a job, having a career already,

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.640
I think that's absolutely the way to go.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.860
And that's what I recommend to everyone is like don't – you have an idea.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:34.820
You quit your job.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.400
You got a couple months savings.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.200
You're throwing it all on the line on one shot.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.840
You don't even know marketing.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.820
And that's going to be the most important thing is building an audience of marketing.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.660
You don't even know that part, right?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.260
And you've got a gun to your head.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:54.240
This is a horrible situation in order to – you've got to figure your first business is going to fail.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.100
You've got to figure you're going to have a big learning curve.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.840
You've got to have some runway.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:05.640
So I think – and plus, I think most people don't realize what it's actually like to work really hard.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.180
And I don't say that to slight people or to belittle anyone.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:17.440
But when I started doing a full-time job and working part-time doing the Pluralsight,

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.600
I realized, man, I've been sandbagging it for a while.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.160
There's a huge difference.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:31.160
And even the kind of stuff that I do now, it's like there's a huge – you've got to really check yourself to make sure that you can do that.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:37.720
Because I know plenty of people that have quit their job and like, okay, now I have eight hours a day to get my work – to work on my business.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.620
And they go to Starbucks and they work like an hour.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.840
And that's – and it's just because you've got to get that discipline.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.880
So I think that's, you know, what you said is absolutely critical.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:55.080
Most people should be – like if you can't build a business on the side, you can't build a business full-time.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:02.180
I firmly believe that because if you don't have what it takes to work a full-time job and to build a business at the same time,

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.620
you don't have what it takes to build a business, period.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.520
It requires that much.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.920
And it's not for everyone.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.360
But if you're going to do it, you've got to be able to do that.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:16.020
And then the other thing that I say, though, kind of the contradictory side of it is if I were young,

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:24.680
if I were like 18, 19, just starting out, I would never – I would like – I would go and move to Thailand and, you know,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.360
Chiang Mai or something like that where it's like $500 a month cost of living.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:34.820
Or I'd find like a roommate situation where my – I would get my living expenses to be under $1,000 a month.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.920
There's ways to live under $1,000 a month, under $500 a month if I could.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.640
And I would just focus everything on building an online business.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:49.700
Because as soon as you hit the point where if your expenses are $1,000 a month and you build a business that generates $1,000 a month,

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:59.560
which is really not that hard, it can be done certainly in a year by anyone that's willing to really go at it, you're free for life.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.520
Now, you're not going to make as much money in the short term.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.420
But in the long term, you know, that's what I would recommend.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.320
But I think it's two different paths.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:16.400
You know, if you're already down the path, like you've got – at 18, 19, you've got nothing to lose going that route.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:22.400
At like, you know, in your late 20s or 30s, you've got a family, you've got a mortgage, you've got, you know, people that depend on you.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.800
You've got a lot to lose.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:29.640
So you can't take that kind of a – you know, you can't be a vagabond and take that kind of risk.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.460
Yeah, I agree.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.620
I really wish I had thought about some of these things when I was younger.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.020
But, you know, it's still – it's all good.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:48.100
One thing, though, I'd like to maybe take it back to is like as we maybe could move a little bit into your book is we're talking about this move into entrepreneurship and how amazing I think it is in you as well.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:54.100
But what we're talking about I think really applies across the board, especially your book applies across the board.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.720
Like even if you just work at a company with 20,000 employees doing software development, right?

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:09.600
So one of the quotes I like from your book is you said – you quoted someone and says, the biggest mistake that you can make is to believe that you're working for someone else.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.120
You know, job security is gone.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.760
The driving force of a career must come from the individual.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.780
Jobs are owned by the company, but you own your career.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:25.100
And I think that really sets the stage well for shifting the focus of what you need to do long term.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.000
Yeah, yeah, I totally agree.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.780
You know, I think that the thing is that you have to have the mindset that you are a business, right?

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.900
That you are the business, not that you're an employee, whether you're an employee or not.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:49.280
Because really, you know, and I always tell developers that if you're an employee of a company, that just means that you own a business that has one customer, right?

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:56.340
And the reason why that mindset is so important is because it changes the way that you think about everything, right?

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:05.480
You know, there's a whole different mindset between I go to work and I clock in and then I get my paycheck and that's owed to me.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.440
It's almost an entitled attitude.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:18.520
You know, it's not quite – you know, it's not like you expect to get something for nothing, but you expect that if you just show up and you are there doing your work that you get a paycheck.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.980
And that's not really how the world works.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.820
It's an abstraction above the real economics of the world.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:32.920
The real way that the world works is that you create some kind of product or service or some value for people and people pay you for that.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.720
And so underlying every single business is this model.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.980
We just create this abstraction over it when we're an employee and expect that hours equals pay.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:47.360
But that's – as an entrepreneur, you know that you can put in a lot of hours and that might not equal pay.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:54.860
But underneath whatever environment that you're working in, whatever company it is, they have the reality of the situation.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.360
It doesn't matter if you're in a large company or a small company.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.420
That company creates some kind of value.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.860
It creates some kind of product, some kind of service.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.940
You're part of that creation and that's where the money comes from.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:16.920
So when you're divorced from that and you don't realize that and you don't have that mindset, you're disconnecting yourself from a lot of opportunity and ways that you can grow your career.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:25.360
And so even if you don't want to be an entrepreneur, just as an employee, just having this mindset of realizing that you are a business and this is how the economic model works.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.480
This is how the system works.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.220
It gives you more opportunities to explore.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:38.520
It gives you the thinking to say, well, if I market myself, if I build a blog, if I create – if I become more valuable as a developer, I can make more money.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:44.120
I can – there's more opportunities out there than just work, get paid for those hours.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.500
You know, there's a whole range of possibility.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:51.020
And you start thinking about, well, okay, this company that I work for, well, let's see.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.920
You know, if I think of them as my client, how can I make my client better?

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.340
How can I make them more money?

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.980
Would they be willing to give me part of the money that I'm able to make them?

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.500
Maybe, right?

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.960
You've got more opportunities.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.760
So I think that's, you know, critical to shift that mindset.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.780
It's definitely a big mind shift.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:16.340
And I think, like you say, it really is important, you know, to go back to this value, you create sort of trading value for money.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:21.420
When you're a business, there's a very sort of continuous curve.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.860
Today I sold X number of widgets or N number of courses.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:34.760
And then the next day – so you have like a really fine curve that you can actually see sales going up, sales going down, expenses going up, expenses going down.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:39.800
But when you're an employee, I feel like the same curve applies, but it's discrete.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.660
Like the way you feel it is discrete.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.260
You get the same amount of money and either you get a raise, you get a promotion, or you don't.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.420
Or you get demoted or let go, or you don't.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.800
But there's only like three or four steps.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.620
It's not like a continuous sort of curve on a real number scale.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.380
But the curve is still there.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:03.580
And, you know, you've got to really be thinking as if the curve was continuous even though it's not.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.860
So your book – let's talk a little bit about your book.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.880
So your book is called Soft Skills.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.680
What's the full title?

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.020
I'm sorry.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:11.940
I don't have it pulled up right now.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.760
Oh, Soft Skills, the Software Developer's Life Manual.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.380
Yes.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:20.660
And I think it's a super interesting take on helping developers with their career.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.560
because there's a ton of career books about like general career.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:31.300
And there's a ton of software developer books like here's how you call a function with name parameters

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.480
and Objective-C or something weird like that.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:40.400
But the sort of I'm going to take and focus on career specifically for software developer

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.600
and technical folks.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.960
I think that's a really valuable book and niche that you filled there.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.620
So the first thing you start with is this business mindset that we already talked about.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.960
The next thing is focusing on people skills.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:58.440
And, you know, like the idea is a lot of us feel like we should be able to just write code.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.640
Hey, my code is cleaner than anyone else's or whatever.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.340
So I should be advancing in my career.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.400
But that's not necessarily true, right?

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.600
So what are you talking about with people skills?

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.260
Right.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:16.400
I think that it turns out that the most valuable thing that helped me in my career

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:22.660
and that as I work with developers and hear their stories and successes is not the technical skills.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:28.140
It turns out to be it's all those the soft skills, the other skills, right, which I talk about in the book.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:37.360
But people skills in general tends to be one of the biggest areas of leverage of where a lot of developers lack these skills.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.660
And they think they don't need those skills.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.220
They think that being technically competent is enough.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.400
And maybe, I mean, I say maybe, but I know that it's not true.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.340
I say maybe back in the day that that was true.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.340
But it's never been true, right?

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:59.060
Because if you look at in the industrial age, you know, the industrial barons and stuff and you read some of their writings and memoirs and stuff,

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.720
you find, again, that people skills is more important than technical skills.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:12.220
But specifically in our field, especially today, we have hit this point where software development, programming itself,

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:18.300
is going through a period which I think is almost becoming commoditized, right?

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:27.580
We have plenty of places we can go online to find programmers that will program and they're real good at it for very low hourly wages.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:38.100
So why would a company, why would a person hire a programmer today and pay them, you know, the kind of salaries that we would like to get?

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:43.740
And part of that is because or a majority of that is because of their communication, because of their people skills,

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.700
because they don't just program.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.060
They can get along with the team.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.700
They can express their ideas and opinions.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.180
They know how to interact.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.140
They know how to communicate.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.060
They know how to make the team better.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.040
And so I think that's a critical, critical skill.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:08.880
And if you think about it just, you know, from an employee perspective, if you want to get ahead in your career, if you want to get ahead in your job,

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.980
a lot of people say, oh, well, you know, sure, I could be a brown noser or kiss up to the boss.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.680
And that's not what people skills are.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.820
It's about being able to make your team more effective.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:27.420
It's being able to understand humans and interact with them in such a way that you're able to not just, you know, code,

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:34.720
but communicate the ideas, make the team better, get everyone on board, align people in the same direction.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.380
And so those things are all really, really important.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:46.320
Because if you think about it, as a software developer, at least in most places I've worked, most of your time is not spent writing code.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:53.260
A lot of your time is writing emails and meetings, communicating your ideas to coworkers, having discussions.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:57.060
These are the things that you actually spend most of your time doing.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:05.780
And so if you're not good at those things, then, you know, most of your job, the most leveraged, effective part of your job, you're lacking in.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.760
So I think people skills are definitely a really important component.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.120
And it just helps you in your life in general.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:18.320
I mean, you know, when you're talking to someone, when you're trying to get a raise, when you're, if you're someone that can be put in front of a customer,

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:27.900
if you know what motivates a person and how to get them motivated, you're going to have a lot more success in getting what you want.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.080
Yeah, I think that's definitely true.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.300
I feel like being a really good programmer these days are kind of table stakes.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.620
But it's not enough to really win the game.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.240
You've got to, you've got to do more, right?

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:48.320
So one of the things that you talked about when you were a full-time employee, it's not an entrepreneurial thing, is keeping your manager really well informed.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.000
One of the things I sucked at when I was a full-time employee was I would work really hard.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.520
I would do amazing stuff.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.860
I'd ship projects early.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:01.040
But I didn't communicate very well what I had done, what I was going to do, and so on.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.980
So you had a good story about what you did.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.420
I forget exactly where I came up with the idea.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.340
But I basically started creating what I called weekly reports.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:16.100
And what I would do is I think maybe I had this idea because I was put into a role of managing a team.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:24.000
And I realized that the main job is managing this team that I just need to know what everyone was doing and working on.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.460
And I needed this information so I could relay that information.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.040
So I remember getting this job and I thought, okay, here's what I'm going to do.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.760
Every day I'm just going to start writing down.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.240
I'm going to make a few bullet points of what I did that day.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.480
And so what I ended up doing was the first week I was there, it was this contract job.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.300
I sent a weekly report and I had Monday, I did this, I accomplished this.

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.240
And I put it in terms of what I accomplished really, right?

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:55.900
And I talked about just a few bullet points for every day so that they would know exactly what I did every single day and what I accomplished.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.320
And I sent that to my manager and I CC'd his manager.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:10.380
And I said, and I explained on the first email, I said, look, the reason why I'm doing this is because just in case you're out, you know, and just as a FYI so that you can see what's going on.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.340
And, you know, I phrased it really well.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:19.280
It was, you know, in my mind I was thinking, okay, you know, I want to make sure that I'm getting as much visibility as possible.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.980
And so, yeah, so that's what I ended up doing.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.120
And I started doing that, you know, every week they could expect from me to get a weekly report.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.920
Showing exactly what I did that week.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:37.260
And it turned out to be a really good move for my career because all the work, like you said, that I was doing, now I was getting credit for.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.060
Now it was visible.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:46.840
And there was no—in fact, one time I remember there was a highly politically charged environment at one of the corporations I was working at.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:55.280
And someone had got into a—was trying to maneuver politically and get me into trouble.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.960
And they accused me of something or of not working on something.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.580
And we got into a meeting.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.060
And I had notes.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.900
I had, you know, weekly reports.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:13.880
Not just my own personal notes, but weekly reports that had been sent out every single week that said exactly what I did on a particular day.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:19.980
That worked out really well for me and not so much for the other person who had no data at all.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.280
So I think it's a really, really good way.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:31.260
And, you know, that's a good—if you think about it, again, this comes back to people skills and thinking like a business is this idea that what does your manager need?

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:41.060
You know, I always tell developers, your job, right, as a developer or as an employee in any company is to make your manager look as good as possible.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:49.000
That's really like if you want to advance in your career, don't try and necessarily make yourself look as good as possible, but make your manager.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.620
And by sending weekly reports, you're helping them to do their job more efficiently.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.660
And you're really giving them the credit of, okay, because they're in charge of you.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.180
And so the better that you do, it reflects better on them.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:09.280
And so by couching it that way and showing how—giving them the information that they need to be able to do their job better, it's going to make it better for you.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:16.600
Yeah, I think that's a really interesting piece of practical advice that would be, you know, totally missing from a lot of career books.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.940
I think that's great.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:35.740
Continuous delivery isn't just a buzzword.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.380
It's a shift in productivity that will help your whole team become more efficient.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:45.560
With SnapCI's continuous delivery tool, you can test, debug, and deploy your code quickly and reliably.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:51.460
Get your product in the hands of your users faster and deploy from just about anywhere at any time.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:56.660
And did you know that ThoughtWorks literally wrote the book on continuous integration and continuous delivery?

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:24.660
One of the things that I've tried to help people with on my show, I did a show 39 and 41 about people getting their first job.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:32.740
Because I feel like getting into software development, there's a pretty big step to actually get your first job and break in.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:40.740
But once you're in, I feel like if you're continually learning, you're probably going to have not a huge problem finding a job.

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.000
I know there's some exceptions to that.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.280
But in general, I think the hardest step you take is getting into the industry.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.460
And so you had some really interesting advice around hacking the interview.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.180
Yeah.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:58.420
So I think that if you just take your resume and apply for a job, that's the worst way to get a job.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.260
Because you're competing with everyone else because you're just a resume.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.840
You're just some data point to a company.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:10.260
But what I find is, can you figure out a way to go into the back door, right?

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:20.000
And the best way to get a job, the way that most jobs get filled, a majority of jobs that you don't even see that are even posted, is through referrals, through personal referrals, right?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:20.820
We hire someone.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:25.300
Because, again, you said that it's really hard for someone to get started in the industry.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:38.420
And I think primarily the reason why, which I haven't heard too many people say, but honestly, like hiring developers, I think that the main reason is because you're afraid that someone can't actually code.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:45.040
And this seems kind of funny, but I remember when the whole FizzBuzz thing was really big.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.860
And, you know, it was all over the place.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:51.440
Like everyone was saying, oh, I can't believe people can't do FizzBuzz.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:57.540
And then I interviewed like several developers and they even knew about the FizzBuzz thing.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.620
And I asked them to do FizzBuzz.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.840
And they thought that was funny because – but they couldn't do it.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.380
And I thought to myself, holy crap, this is just crazy.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:13.300
Is this really – like, I mean, yeah, I understand that it's under pressure and whatnot.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:18.820
But if you know this is going on and you haven't prepared, oh, gosh.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:23.660
And so that's the biggest risk is when you hire a developer, can they actually code?

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.520
Maybe they can fix a few bugs, but could they actually write real code?

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:33.160
Because that can have a huge negative impact and you have to – and you won't even necessarily know it.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:48.240
So, you know, all that is to say that when someone hires someone, the best way to hire someone is to know – not to get a resume and then see what kind of BS they're going to tell you in an interview.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:53.360
But to say if you already know someone, you know someone who knows someone who's an excellent coder, right?

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.240
This is a great way.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.820
This is why personal networks and referrals work so well.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:03.680
So, can you figure out some way instead of just submitting your resume blind to get a personal referral?

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:09.940
Can you – you know, and one of the examples that I use in the book is I wanted to get this remote job, right?

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.520
I wanted to work from home.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:19.580
That was my – there was this particular company and I felt like they're a good company and I just – I wanted to get a good job working from home.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:24.500
And it was so competitive to get into that company because there's so many people who wanted that job, obviously.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:35.560
So, what I did was I started finding some of the developers that worked for that company and I started reading their blogs and I started putting meaningful comments on their blogs.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:43.060
Not just being lame and just trying to see what I could get but actually contributing to their blogs and getting noticed.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:50.800
And after several months worth of time, pretty much all the developers on that team knew who I was because I was this guy that was commenting on their blogs.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.640
We were having discussions and whatnot.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:56.360
And guess what happened the next time that they opened up a job opening?

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:01.760
Well, not only did I get a personal referral but several developers on that team said,

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.420
Hey, John, you should apply for this job.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:09.240
And of course, you know, when I did, they referred me, handed in my resume.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.780
And then multiple developers on that team said, Oh, I know who that guy is.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:13.300
He's awesome.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.660
And so, obviously, I got that job.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:20.460
And that's the better way than just submitting your resume.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:28.480
You know, you can—you hack the interview process by not having—by having the interviewer know who you are before you go into the interview.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.440
It's—and that can be done in multiple ways.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.940
You know, I always encourage developers to market themselves, to build a blog, something like that.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:44.420
It's great when you go into an interview and you shake the interviewer's hand and they say, Oh, oh, you know, I think I read a blog post that you wrote.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.340
I know who you are.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:52.140
And then instead of having a grueling interview, you have an hour-long conversation because you're already in.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.760
So, people primarily hire people that they like.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:05.500
They figure out—it's weird how, like, you know, we all want to be objective and say that it's a meritocracy and we hire based on technical skill.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:16.540
But we have this way, you know, psychologically in our mind of justifying, of saying—of finding someone who we don't like and finding problems why they're—you know, why they're weak technically.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:23.000
And someone we do like and finding reasons why they're going to succeed even though they don't know this or making excuses for them.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.380
So, you've got to remember that psychology and you've got to get—you really have to build rapport with an interviewer before the interview.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:39.660
You know, if you want to go around the back door, not go through the initial—the process that everyone goes through, which is the most difficult way to get hired for a job.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:40.480
Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:44.080
If you can get a recommendation, it's so much better.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:56.600
The companies I've worked for, the point where it becomes a publicly available job where resumes are requested, it would never even make it that far if somebody on the team knew somebody they could recommend.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.220
Exactly.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:02.920
Like, that's like, oh, geez, I guess we're going to have to actually open this up as a job rather than just get a recommendation.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.460
So, very, very, very important.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:15.280
And I think this whole marketing yourself thing is more important than many people realize, even for regular sort of full-time employment situations.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.880
But let's come back to that in just a minute.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:33.560
So, one of the things that you discuss, and I think is a really interesting question people want to figure out for themselves, is should you try to work at a small company where you'll have a broader range of exposure to technology, broader responsibilities, and so on?

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:39.720
Or at a large company where it might be more focused, but you'll have more people you can work with and depend on and so on?

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.260
What do you think about, like, a small company versus large company?

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.720
You know, I think there's pros and cons to both.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.500
And, you know, I've worked for both in my career.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:43:00.280
I tend to prefer a small company, especially if you're getting started out, because you get more involved in the business and the economics of it and your hands into more things.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.180
It's a huge advantage of a small company.

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.260
With big company, and plus you're more visible, right?

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.940
You can't hide in the weeds.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:13.920
Like, what you do, both positive and negative, is going to have a direct impact on the bottom line.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:21.920
And so, you have this opportunity to actually move the needle and to make a difference and to get exposed to a large variety of things.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.640
In a big company, you might be able to work on cooler projects, right?

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:32.000
You might be able to work on things that only a big company could do and you might have more training opportunities and things like that.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:39.960
But, you know, there's nothing like getting the experience, getting that kind of experience that a small company provides.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:50.860
So, you know, if I were to say what is ideal as an employee, I would probably say that it's to spend a lot of time at various small companies.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:56.420
I think that's—you're going to get the largest volume of experience by doing that.

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.840
But, you know, there's some people that—and it's changing, right?

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.180
You know, there's some people that have worked at Microsoft their entire life or HP.

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:10.820
I mean, when I was at HP, there were, you know, 30-year—they interned at HP and they just worked at HP for 30 years in development.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.660
And they made good money and they had good careers.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:23.420
But, gosh, that—I mean, can you imagine what would happen if you got laid off after working for 30 years at the same job and you never had any other job experience?

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.980
That would be a traumatic life event.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.580
That would be like having your spouse killed or something like that.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.580
I mean, that level of trauma, I can imagine.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:40.500
So, I would strongly encourage people to at least—at least, you know, if you're starting out, to work at multiple companies.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.920
And if they're small companies, I think you can gain that experience faster.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:51.560
And then if you decide you want to go the corporate route and climb the corporate ladder, then maybe you do that later on in your career and then you can—there's time for that.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:59.160
But I feel like you get a little bit more benefit out of the smaller companies than you do out of the large.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.620
Yeah, I tend to agree with you.

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:10.060
I think one of the caveats of being really successful at a small company is you have to be willing to say things like, I have no idea how to do that.

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.440
But give me two days and I'll figure it out.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:22.540
Because you may be the guy or girl who they come to and say, hey, we need to set up a new server and we've got to do SSL and e-commerce.

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.240
And nobody here has ever done that.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.280
But we've nominated you to do the e-commerce system.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.780
You're like, well, I've never done it either, right?

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:35.140
But it's both a huge opportunity that you're given the time, energy, and opportunity to do that.

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:43.640
But if you don't want to be the person that gets repeatedly thrown into the deep end of some other strange technology, then maybe a larger company would be better for you.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:48.380
But if you can embrace it, I feel like you'll really flourish from being in that environment.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.500
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.300
That's—I totally agree.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:52.060
Yeah.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:46:00.140
Another thing that you talk about, and maybe this is a good segue towards marketing, is specialization and niches.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:09.780
Yeah, I think this is one of those areas that I end up doing the most discussion and talking on because it's a hard pill for many developers to swallow.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:21.600
Because a lot of times we're told to be almost generalist, jack-of-all-trades, that being the super developer that can do anything is highly valuable, to have a wide variety of skills.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:27.740
And I agree that you should have a pretty broad base, but I feel like marketing yourself.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:34.100
Like if you don't have a specialization, if you don't have a focus, if you don't have a very clear message, it's going to be really difficult.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:55.320
And one of the examples I like to use is if you were convicted of a crime, let's say murder, would you go to hire a lawyer who dabbles in family law and does some tax stuff and maybe does some criminal law here or there, right?

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.480
It's a generalist, right?

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.040
You would not trust them with the rest of your life.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:00.660
It's crazy, right?

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.100
Yeah, it's crazy, right?

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:09.980
So you would say, I want the best criminal defense attorney that specializes in murder cases, right, that you can find.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.780
You want that specialist, right?

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:20.280
Even if the journalist could do just as a good job and you're like, well, you know, the journalist could say, well, I know all kinds of law.

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:25.300
You're like, no, no, no, no, just give me the criminal defense lawyer, please, right?

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.440
You want that specialist guy.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:35.440
And the criminal defense lawyer, he might have experience with tax law and divorce law and all that stuff, but he's not going to advertise it that way.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.660
And that's how—and that's the thing.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.960
It's like when you are—again, it's shifting the mindset, right?

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:44.780
As an employee, sometimes we have this mindset of I need to know all this stuff.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:49.240
But as an employer, someone hiring you, it's the same thing.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:55.900
They're like, well, you know, I've got this application that I need to get built and it costs me money to build this thing.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.040
I want the person that can do it, right?

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.020
I'm building this, you know, whatever it is, framework.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:06.140
You know, I'm using this—I'm building this new Angular app.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.320
I want an expert in Angular, right?

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.440
So I think that it's critical.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:17.820
And when you think about it, if you want to build the highest rate, if you want to get the best job, it's going to be—it's going to go to a specialist.

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.880
Being a specialist is important.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:24.480
So it's important to pick some area that you are going to become the expert in.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.400
And there's so many—I mean, there's so many different reasons why this is true.

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:39.640
One other major thing is that if you can be the best in the world at a particular thing, and it can be a really small thing, there's a huge, huge advantage for being number one, right?

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.280
I mean, you're going to get the invites to speak at the conferences.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.860
You can write the book on the subject.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:48.300
You can, you know, have the coaching or consulting business.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:54.220
Or you can have the blog where whenever anyone types in this particular keyword, it comes to you.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.460
So you can build a reputation much faster.

00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:03.860
You always want to be the big fish in the small pond, especially when you're starting out, rather than being the small fish in the big pond.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.420
Because it's going to take you so long to get momentum.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:13.040
If you just wanted to be—I think a lot of younger developers that I talk to, they say, well, how could I become a famous software developer?

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.300
And I'm like, well, it's not by being a famous software developer.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:22.940
It's by being this person who specifically—they're the best at this particular framework.

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:26.640
You know, you build your reputation that way.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:37.180
That's a lot easier to make ground, to become an expert in a particular market, a particular technology, than it is to just be a generalist, you know, a technologist.

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:40.980
That would be probably the hardest way to build a name for yourself.

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:46.420
Instead, pick that small, small specialization where you don't have competition.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.480
Because you can easily become number one.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:55.480
And that's going to be—not only is it going to help your career, but it's going to give you so many options that you didn't have before.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:07.700
Yeah, I think that's really interesting and almost counterintuitive in some ways by focusing down, and at least from the way you present yourself, not necessarily what you know, but the way you present yourself to the world.

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:13.740
By saying, I'm going to focus on this thing, actually more opportunities open up rather than say, I can do anything.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:20.180
Once you kind of become the person who can do anything, you're thrown in with everybody, and you kind of just get lost in the sea.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:20.580
Exactly.

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.960
And people don't really believe you can do anything, right?

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:30.640
I mean, that's—as developers, we know that you can be—you can't know everything, but you can be really, really good.

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:34.440
But people will never really believe you're as good as you are when you claim.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:38.560
But when you claim to be an expert in a particular thing, they're more likely to buy that.

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:51.840
Yeah, especially if you have evidence, like a blog recorded public speaking on, like, some conference, and they put the videos, like PyCon or NDC Oslo or something like that.

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:57.120
They put the videos online, and you can say, here is the video of me presenting for an hour on this.

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.300
Here is my blog with 20 articles on this.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:06.340
Just go type this word into Google, and you will see my name and my word come up next to it.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:12.120
And then that's almost like, you know, you talked about getting the personal recommendation through the back channel.

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.480
This is like the personal recommendation to people you don't know.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.160
Exactly.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.520
And, you know, and the first thing that someone's going to do when you apply for a job anyway is they're going to Google your name.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:31.000
And when it comes up and there's like a YouTube video of you speaking at a conference and your blog comes up and all this stuff, you just got the job.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.760
Now they're interviewing you as a formality to find out if you're crazy or not.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.820
Right?

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:42.220
But, you know, that's so much better because they might spend an hour reading your blog or watching your video.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.280
That's more time than you would have at a face-to-face interview.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.580
And you've got the proof, the social proof.

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:53.900
You've got better than anything that you could possibly do at an interview or put on your resume.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.320
So that's why it's so critical.

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:56.860
Yeah.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:08.360
One of the things that a lot of the people on my how to get your first job segment that I did previously last year that I had one half where it was new people and their experience of getting their first job.

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.640
The other half was people who do the hiring at like Netflix and PayPal and so on.

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:18.640
And they all said, look, we're going to go to your GitHub repository and look at your check-in and your repos.

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.060
And, you know, also other things, right?

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:24.400
Like searching for you, looking at your blogs, looking at your presentations.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.080
And you can't fake that stuff.

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.700
You can't decide, I want to get that job.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.320
So I'm going to go put stuff on my GitHub that looks relevant.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.060
Like that has a history over years.

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:38.480
And you have to be building towards that, right?

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:38.920
Exactly.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:39.340
Yeah.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:39.740
Yeah.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:43.300
So we're getting a little towards the end of our time to talk.

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:54.160
What advice can you give people about marketing yourself in starting down this path where if somebody Googles some aspect of some framework or whatever, like you become the person for that?

00:52:54.160 --> 00:53:02.100
What handful of things would you say to developers, even as full-time employees, that they should be doing to sort of boost their brand, if you will?

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:02.560
Okay.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:10.040
So I would say, you know, first of all, the easiest thing that I think most developers can do that's very accessible, especially in the development world, is to create a blog.

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.460
This is pretty simple.

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:14.100
You know, this is something – I've got a free course on it.

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:18.520
If you just go to simpleprogrammer.com, you'll see a pop-up that you can sign up.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.460
But it's an email course, and it gives you the step-by-step directions on how to do this.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.560
Every developer should have a blog that they keep and they update regularly.

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:30.860
That's the first thing, and it's for a couple of reasons.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:44.680
One of the big ones is because when they go with your name and then your blog comes up and it's updated regularly and it has good content on there, that's a really, really good way to – if it's in writing, it seems more relevant too, right?

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:53.760
So if you have a blog and it's got your opinions on there and you've got good information on there, that's going to be more better than any interview.

00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:01.580
But, you know, if you really want to boost up your brand, what you should really aim to do is – again, we talked about the specialization.

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:03.120
But you should pick out your niche.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.400
What is it going to be?

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:09.780
And you should try to be everywhere whenever anyone searches on that topic.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:19.660
So whatever niche that you want to specialize in, if you can show up on as many mediums as possible, that's going to create a really strong branding connection.

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:35.060
For example, if you found my book or you found my blog and then later on you hear me on a podcast or you find my podcast or you find a YouTube video, you're like, oh, this is – I just listened to this guy.

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:39.640
Suddenly it connects and someone remembers your name and they're like, oh, I heard this person before.

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:45.120
And now, you know, if someone hears you from two sources, two different mediums, you're famous instantly.

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.540
And that's – because that's what we were associating in our head, right?

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:57.060
If you think about it in yourself, right, and you think about the people that you know that are, quote, famous to you, it's because you heard them on two or three different sources.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.180
And that's critical.

00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:10.140
So that's what really builds a brand that I've discovered is that if you can get out there in multiple mediums and when people have multiple exposures to you, then they're going to really – it's really going to connect.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:14.960
Especially if someone can talk to someone else and they say, oh, this guy, I read his blog.

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.280
Oh, I know that guy.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.680
Bam, you're in.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.380
So you want to try and build those type of things.

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:24.480
And the best way to do it is to pick a really good niche, a good specialization.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:34.820
And then I would say that, you know, the third thing I would say is your primary – you know, the way that I view marketing and branding yourself and really is a positive light.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:40.860
It's not sending out spam emails with advertising Viagra pills, right, unsolicited.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.700
It's creating value for people.

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:48.340
If you go out there and you create a bunch of free value for people, you will get a return.

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:54.040
I always say that I give away 90% of what I do for free and I charge for 10% of it.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:56:00.520
And that's because that's the best marketing that you could possibly do is to give people free value.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.940
Because when you do that, then they share it.

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.380
They're like, oh, this guy is awesome.

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:06.180
He's smart, right?

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:20.220
They want more from you and they'll eventually, if you're selling something, they'll buy something from you or they'll hire you or they'll, you know, they're going to want to do business with you because you've built trust because they know they've already gotten something valuable from you.

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.760
So I would say, you know, go out there and try to create as much value.

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.860
How can you contribute to the world?

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.340
What thing can you create?

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:33.780
What information can you put out there in a blog, in YouTube video, podcast, whatever it is that is going to create value for people?

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:36.320
And don't worry about what you're going to get back, right?

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.660
I mean, I'm not saying do everything for free and be a charity case.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:44.960
What I'm saying is that you create most of what you do for free.

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:49.080
You focus on creating value and by doing that, you will build up an audience.

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.220
You'll build up a reputation.

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:53.700
And when you have that, then you have, then you can sell something.

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:55.080
Then you can get the job.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.980
Then you can, you know, cash in the check.

00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:00.940
But you got to put a lot of deposits in the bank account before you can make a withdrawal.

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:01.800
Yeah, absolutely.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:09.460
And that could be like videos you put on YouTube, that's tutorials showing people how to be really successful with whatever area you're trying to focus on.

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:11.360
It could also be open source projects, right?

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:16.280
Like the Python community is really, really values open source contributions.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:22.080
So if you had a very popular open source project, that's a huge foot in the door as well.

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:22.380
Oh, yeah.

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.660
Yeah, I definitely think that's true.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.500
That's one area that I hadn't focused on personally.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:32.000
I don't have much out there in the open source world, but it's a huge, huge opportunity.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:44.720
There's a lot of, you hear a lot of success stories where people who had contributed to open source projects or started a major open source project have really had successful careers from that.

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.960
So I totally agree.

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:46.700
Yeah, absolutely.

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.080
Cool.

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:53.060
So I think your book is super interesting and very helpful.

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:58.000
If some of the stuff that we're talking about is like, oh, I hadn't really thought about that.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:58.760
That's really cool.

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:01.180
Then, you know, I don't know how long your book is.

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.720
It's quite long, like six, 700 pages, right?

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:07.700
There's a lot of stuff and concrete practical tips like these in your book.

00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:09.260
So I definitely recommend people check it out.

00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:09.600
Thank you.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.080
And I'll link to it.

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.720
Yeah, I'll link to it in the show notes.

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:18.840
So maybe in our last few minutes, you could just tell us a little bit about what you've got going on at simpleprogrammer.com.

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.720
Because it started out as just your blog, but now you're doing a lot of stuff.

00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.520
Like you have several podcasts going through there.

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.520
You have a video series.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.780
Tell us what's going on there.

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:33.220
Yeah, so, you know, the focus right now, simpleprogrammer.com, I intend to own the word soft skills in the space.

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:41.960
And what I mean by that is that my focus really is not on the technical skills for software developers, but on the soft skills.

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:50.320
On a simple program, I'm focused really—my whole, like, purpose is to help software developers live better lives in all areas of their life.

00:58:50.380 --> 00:59:00.560
Because I have this holistic view, and I feel like if you become a better person in all the areas of your life, you're going to be better in everything that you do, from your career, making money, to being a better programmer.

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.440
And there's not enough focus on that.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.380
So a simple programmer—

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:10.760
Like, for example, if you're in better health, you have better fitness, then you probably have more energy to focus on your job.

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:13.400
Like, there's a lot of secondary knock-on effect, right?

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.580
Oh, yeah, exactly.

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:23.120
I mean, we could even—you know, you could even say if financially, right, if you have good investments, if you have good cash flow coming in, right, you're not stressed financially.

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.820
So your relationships will be better.

00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:27.220
Your mindset will be better, right?

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:30.100
So there's—it's connected in so many ways, I think.

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:39.140
And, you know, so really, I think simpleprogrammer, you could say, is focused on self-development or self-improvement for software developers.

00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:45.760
And so I've got, you know, the blog, there's articles that come out on there, I think, two or three times a week.

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:49.000
And then in some guest posts, we accept on there.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.440
I've got—YouTube is really where I've been devoting a lot of energy.

00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:58.860
I put out two to three YouTube videos a day on all kinds of personal development and career topics for software developers.

00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:05.960
So you can check that out on just youtube.com forward slash simpleprogrammer.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.620
And people can even send you questions, right?

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:07.900
Oh, yeah.

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:09.720
You can answer them if they line up.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.860
A majority of the videos come from questions.

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:17.820
And then, you know, there's a Simple Programmer podcast, which is some of the YouTube videos, the audio from that.

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:19.440
I'm trying to think what else we got.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:25.340
I'm currently writing a new book that I'm actually writing online as I'm writing the book.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.120
I'm sharing it as blog posts.

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:32.200
And it is going to be—it's about—it's an entire book.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:45.040
Probably it will be a two-volume set about a software developer career from the very beginning of how to get started and what you need to know to managing your career successfully and to making future steps in your career.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.600
So it's going to be bigger.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.820
It's probably going to be about 700 pages.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:52.300
Right now there's about like about 80,000 words written.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:57.960
But, yeah, I'm working on that, and that's being sent out every week.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:01.240
A new chapter gets posted on the blog there.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:10.840
But, yeah, my big focus is really just I want to help software developers to become better, to become better at their lives, become better at what they're doing.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:16.080
Yeah, I feel like sort of a manifestation of a lot of what are the advice that you're giving, right?

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.320
Like you found this particular area of focus, this niche.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:26.540
You've put the work into it as a side business to build it up enough to sort of go and focus on it entirely.

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.160
And now you're able to just put your energy into it, and it's really going well.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:30.820
That's awesome.

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:39.400
So do you have any final call for action, like for the people who are out there thinking like, hey, I could do better in my career, maybe get a different job or a promotion or something?

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.940
What would you say final call action?

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:49.300
I would say the thing when I sign my soft skills book, every book that I sign, I pretty much write the same thing.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.480
I write take action.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:58.020
And so what I would encourage it, and when I give a talk, one of the first things I say is I say, hey, look, don't take notes on what I'm saying.

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.920
Take notes on what you're going to do because that's what's important.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.100
And so I would say that for anyone listening, it's great.

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:07.140
You might be nodding your head and saying, oh, yeah, I totally agree with John.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.200
Or you might be saying, oh, that John guy, he's a douchebag.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.240
Whatever.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.040
But regardless, if you're nodding your head, don't just nod your head.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.780
Don't just agree.

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:16.920
I read plenty of books.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.140
You listen to plenty of things, and you say, yeah, yeah, that's cool.

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:19.760
That makes sense.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.320
I'm totally going to do that.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.060
Do it.

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:29.460
Pick something that you're going to change, something that you're going to do, and actually do it.

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.600
Commit to it.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.920
Make an actual step because that's what you can read a book, and a book is just words until you take action.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.340
So take action.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.140
Figure out something.

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.480
I don't know if you do.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.640
Do you do comments on the blog post?

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.620
I mean on the podcast?

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.100
There's a whole comment section in the show page.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:48.640
Oh, cool.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.480
Let's do this then.

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:58.940
If this is cool with you, maybe we can have people that listen to this episode leave a comment and says, what action are they going to take after listening to this episode?

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.520
What specific action are they going to take?

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:07.860
And then maybe you can pick someone, and you can send me their info or email address, and I'll send them a signed copy of my book.

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:08.740
Oh, that's awesome.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:09.860
Yeah, I would love to do that.

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:11.680
I definitely encourage everyone out there listening.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.540
Take action.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:19.440
Put a comment on to the show page, and we'll pick a winner and send a book, but just to be part of it, I think will be great.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:19.660
Cool.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:20.140
Awesome.

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:21.320
Yeah, become a finisher, right?

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.080
Exactly.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.320
Yes, become a finisher.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:23.760
Awesome.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.080
Well, that's great advice, John.

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:28.360
And I really appreciate you being on the show, and I've thoroughly enjoyed the conversation.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:29.340
So thanks a bunch.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.580
Yeah, no, glad to be here.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.320
Thanks for having me.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:31.740
You bet.

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.160
Talk to you later.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.380

I really appreciate it.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.060
Smix, let's get out of here.

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.840
Stating with my voice, there's no norm that I can feel within.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.660
Haven't been sleeping, I've been using lots of rest.

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:19.540
I'll pass the mic back to who rocked it best.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:31.820
I'll pass the mic back to who rocked it best.
