00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.540
We're back with another Geek Out episode. Richard Campbell, a developer and podcaster who dives

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.640
deep into science and tech topics, is back for our third Geek Out episode. This time around,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.520
we're diving deep into renewable energy, energy storage, and just what do we do to keep the lights

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.040
on without frying our beloved Earth? I think you're really going to enjoy this deep dive into

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.740
the science of renewable energy and energy storage. This is Talk Python To Me, episode 329,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.120
recorded August 4th, 2021.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:45.480

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.040
Hey, great to be back, man. It's been a year, quite a year, as I recall.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.960
We're living in like dog years or something like that, right? Every year is like seven years. I don't

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.780
know if we spoke about it, but I definitely joke that historians, when they come back and study this

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.520
time frame, they won't be able to say, you know, what decade or what era they study. It'll be like,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.160
well, what part of 2020 did you study? What part of 2021 did you study? Did you study the summer or was

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.720
it the spring? Because that's a different specialty.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.680
Oh, yeah. No, and it is how much it's changed, and that we're still living with a certain level of

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.420
uncertainty, you know? At the time that we're recording this, the Delta variant's having an impact,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.440
and I think everyone's sort of leaning back again going, uh-oh, how bad is this going to get?

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.700
Yeah.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.920
So, yeah, I don't know. A month from now, things could be very different either way.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.760
Yeah, it could go either way. That's absolutely right. Yeah, so I'm cautiously optimistic,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.760
trying to, you know, live life, be safe, but not be huddled in a corner for too badly, you know?

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.940
And for your own sanity. I mean, one nice thing about being up on the coast is, like,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.780
the view is impeccable. We're right on the ocean. You'll probably even hear it a bit in the recording.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.500
Like, it keeps you sane to be able to be out here and breathe the air and just try and connect with

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.340
folks, even if it's, it has to be remote, that's all.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.360
Yeah, yeah. Well, for the audio podcast listeners, tell us how you were speaking to us.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.320
Via Starlink through, I got on the beta for Starlink right at the very beginning,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.620
and because we're in this relatively remote location, we were opted in very early on.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.780
There is cable modem service up here, but it's broken at the moment. And so there's repairs

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.780
trying to be done this morning, which is one of the reasons we delayed recording,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.580
but they have not been successful so far. So we're counting on Elon's magic as one of,

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.960
as now the largest satellite operator in the world. And soon he'll be more satellites than

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.700
everybody else combined at the rate he's going. And it's been pretty good, but, you know,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.100
there are dropouts. It's never flawless. And this, what we're asking it to do, this real-time

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.300
thing is, of course, the hardest thing.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.080
Right, right. We're going real-time to space, which is pretty amazing, but it's kind of cool.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.660
I haven't had a chance to speak with anyone who's had real experience with Starlink.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.040
It's neat to have it.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.180
Yeah, you're part of the experiment now, friend.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.820
That's right.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.440
Here we are.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.140
Exactly. We were planning on using high-speed wired internet, but it broke. And so it's a really cool

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.040
fallback to have. And I think it's actually going to be really empowering for people in places where

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.000
that's not an option.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.360
Yeah. And certainly I've talked to a bunch of friends who are all very interested in it.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.620
Because I'm right on the ocean, I have a very clear view of the sky. And that's the real problem

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.100
with Starlink is you need an absolutely clear view of the sky. And often when you're in remote

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.300
locations, you're surrounded by trees. And trees and Starlink are not friends.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.560
No. And satellites definitely don't mix.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.160
Yeah. It just doesn't work.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.600
Well, I'm really glad that we're able to make this happen. And I say that with fingers crossed

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.980
for another 45 minutes or whatever it's going to be.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.400
What a time we got. Yeah.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.740
Absolutely.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.040
Well, let's hope the satellites are well aligned for this next period and we'll have a good call.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.660
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.240
So this episode is going to be like some of the previous ones that you've been on before

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.240
in that it's going to be one of these Geek Out episodes. And the Geek Out episodes I learned

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.000
about, which mostly, I guess, premiered on .NET Rocks. Is that right?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.260
Right. Yeah. It's totally my friend Carl's idea. I did not want to do these. I thought it was

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.260
a bad idea and I was wrong. So the first Geek Out was back in 2011 and it was about the shuttle

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.300
ending and just my thoughts on what went right and what went wrong with the space shuttle.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.300
And it continued from there. It became a pleasure for me. I'm a researcher by nature

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.060
and I've always been organizing my thoughts around different technologies just because I like to read

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.420
and research. And the shows basically drove me to finish. Now make an hour long conversation about

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.420
that technology. Isn't that interesting about being able to present something?

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.180
Yeah.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.300
You have to close those loops that you're like, oh, that's interesting, but I'm not going to dig into

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.040
that corner or that corner of this thing. And then when you've got to stand up and present it,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.180
I feel like that's a great way to learn stuff in general as people in technology, not just for the

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.720
Geek Out thing.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.840
You definitely end up better at it. One of the series that I'm very proud of that absolutely the

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.160
process of making this show has transformed it was the fusion series. Because I originally thought I'd do

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.840
a show on fusion. But as I started really organizing all the materials, I realized there was three

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.480
different shows there. There was a show about national fusion, like the ITER and JET and the National

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.200
Ignition Laboratories, all of these big government projects. And then there was the tech billionaire pet

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.200
fusion projects because you're not a cool tech billionaire if you don't have one. And so there's

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.840
a moment where I realized, geez, every one of them has one and they're all wacky. And then I ran across

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.800
a set of papers out of Mitsubishi Labs about low energy fusion reactions. And that actually walked us into

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:18.040
a real conversation about cold fusion, which surprised me. It's like pseudoscience for a long time. But the

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.120
Mitsubishi Labs experiments in the late 2000-aughts were very real and repeatable. Mitsubishi was smart

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.680
enough that when they realized they had something consistent, they handed it over to Toyota, their

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.200
arch rival, and said, "Here, you reproduce this." Because if anybody was going to punch holes in it,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.920
it was their arch rival. And they repeated the experiment successfully. And if you listen to that

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.760
show, I'll give away the ending. Yes, you can do lower energy nuclear reactions. They are a kind of

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.160
fusion. It's a part of science that's not well understood. And it takes more energy to do it than

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.720
it produces. Just the sort of thing you don't want from a power plant. We can make it happen, but it

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.760
doesn't produce net energy. Yeah. It's the fun part of that show is I'm walking Carl through the process. And

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.920
Carl's always a great everyman for those kinds of things. And I actually talked about muon catalyzed

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:11.080
fusion, which is a different kind of low energy fusion and very repeatable, workable, and so forth. It's

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.560
just that it takes more energy to make muons than the fusion reaction produces. Which it turns out

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:22.680
is every kind of fusion except stellar fusion, that's how it's always worked. It takes more energy

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.680
to fuse than it emits. Yeah, well, if you got that much gravity, it definitely is an unfair advantage.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.840
So yeah, so this is going to be another one of these geek out episodes. And we're mostly going to just

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.760
focus on the energy side. So it's sort of relevant that you're talking about fusion here. The other thing,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.200
I guess that's worth just giving a quick shout out to is you're organizing the Dev Intersection

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:50.680
Conference, right? Yeah. So we did a show back in June as a full hybrid show. So some attendees in

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:57.240
person, some attendees remote, and some speakers in person, some speakers remote. So we know how to do

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:04.440
that. We're hoping to do a more in-person show in Vegas, but we're prepared to do hybrid again if necessary,

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.880
because we've pulled it off. But this is a developer show. I mean, we have a close relationship with

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:15.320
Microsoft. So there's lots of .NET content, but also web content across the board, plenty of Azure,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:21.080
artificial intelligence technologies. And it's a very big, broad show and a ton of fun. And the MGM

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.040
Grand is a great location for it. Yeah, that's really cool. I feel like,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.320
you know, last time we spoke, this was the pre-Delta, pre-large scale vaccine. And like,

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.920
oh, look, we're sort of crossing over the hump. And this is going to be like, you'll be able to sort

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.400
of put this back on no problem. And then Delta and all that kind of stuff.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.360
And again, ask me in a month and maybe it'll be fine. But at the moment, we're all sort of holding

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.560
our breath. It's like, we know what to do if we have to. Yeah.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:55.480
I hope I don't have to. Absolutely. All right. So let's dive into our main topic since we are on a

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:02.040
bit of a time crunch since we're going to space. So on this one, I wanted to talk to you about energy.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:08.840
And I think there's a lot of things happening around energy that's both optimistic and amazing,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:15.400
as well as there's setbacks and other things. So, you know, let's talk about sort of the story of

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.960
energy, specifically mostly renewable energy these days. Like, how are we doing?

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:26.120
We're doing pretty well. I mean, obviously the pandemic changed things. Power consumption overall,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:33.560
especially electricity, did decline, especially in the West during the pandemic. Closing of malls and

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:39.320
commercial spaces and so forth, because those spaces tend to be very efficient in the sense that

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.280
you do shut them down, they reduced a lot of power consumption. Now, everybody went home

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.880
and consumed more power at home. But if you think about the normal work cycle where people

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:56.520
are at home, then they go to work and then they come back again, the home is not typically not as

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:02.440
diligently shut down as office spaces. So homes have a sort of always on certain amount of power

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.480
consumption going on. And you can do better than that, be a little more efficient.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.920
Yeah. I bet a bunch of people just leave their AC set to whatever.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.320
Exactly. And you know, the real sin I've come, as I've been studying my house,

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.960
heated floors, those electrically heated floors consume a lot more power than you realize.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.360
Interesting.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.120
And if you learn how long it takes to get them to temperature and so forth, so that you can

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.320
shut them down when you're not home during the day and heat them up when you need them,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.720
that's a lot of power. That's a kilowatt per floor per day. Easy.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.520
Oh, how interesting. Yeah, that is a lot of energy. Yeah. And air conditioners too. And I suspect a lot

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:41.640
of people don't shut them down. So I saw an article recently that talked about, oh, we're actually being

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.400
set back by people working from home because we all now have our computers on and our lights on and our

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:54.040
AC or our heater, depending on the time of the year, at everybody's house instead of one giant office.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:00.760
But what I don't believe that took into account was the person who lives 45 minutes away from the

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:07.800
office and commutes with an old suburban SUV that is burning extra gas, right? Like, I think it just

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.720
looked at the energy of the office and the energy of the homes and said, oh, there's more at the homes,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.360
right? But it eliminated the commute. Well, but I don't think that's true either. In some respects,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:22.840
you have the same computer, if not a less efficient computer at the office. And so that those things were

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.560
turned off. I think the move to the cloud actually ends up being energy efficient because

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:34.760
business owned servers tend to be less utilized than cloud servers. So you're actually gaining

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.920
efficiency in terms of power consumption by shifting those workloads into the cloud. Those machines run at

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.680
a much higher constant utilization rate. So there's fewer CPU serving far more workloads that way.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:50.680
Right, right. How many VPC servers run on top of, you know, one piece of hardware? A lot.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.440
Exactly. I mean, a lot. And of course, they're paid by the, for that, their margin is in that

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:02.520
optimization where typically your owned servers just don't have that same level of utilization.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.160
But I think that the biggest thing that created in the West, the huge power drops was that

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.200
folks shut down those buildings. They turned as much off as they could, far more reliably than anything

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.960
else. The drop in oil, recognizing that, that oil consumption in the form of gasoline and kerosene,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:27.560
50% of all oil is going into road transport and air. And so that drop was tremendous during the peak of the pandemic.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:35.640
In April of 2020, the oil industry calls that black April, because it was, if in the West, it was like 30% reduction.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:44.360
You know, on a typical day in 2019, the world consumed about 80 million barrels of oil. And in

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.320
April of 2020, it was like 45 million.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.200
Yeah, that's amazing.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:54.600
And this thing is like that oil moves all the time. And so if you recall, there was a crisis where

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.280
oil actually went to negative pricing because nobody had anywhere to store it.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:04.280
I remember that. And there was all these people investing in sort of indirectly in oil.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.960
And what I think there were some of them, they didn't realize that they were on the hook to store

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.000
that oil. Exactly.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.800
And then they got seriously hammered.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.040
And so there were oil tankers arriving at refineries with nowhere to offload because the

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.520
tanks were all full. And now the ship was effectively a storage machine. Like that's

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:25.080
how bad it got for a month. And it hasn't fully recovered. Like oil consumption is still down.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:31.320
They don't expect road transport consumption. And I'm referencing the IEA report. This is the

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:37.000
International Energy Association. It's very challenging to get good energy data, quality

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.960
energy data. This is a group that are operated out of Paris there, but they're worldwide and they're

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:47.560
very agnostic. They're not owned by any energy companies. You know, typically when you go looking

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.720
for data like this, you will find energy companies telling you about how their energy is great.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:57.400
This is sort of the most reasonable report you can get in terms of levelizing all of those numbers.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.920
You've heard the clean natural gas.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.200
Yeah. Well, cleaner than coal.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.720
It's a relative statement, isn't it?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:09.000
Give them that. It's about half the emission level of coal, but it's still with significant emissions.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.760
And it's cheap. And that's why natural gas is done so well. So the IEA, I mean, they break down a lot

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.840
of these pandemic details. And one of the points they made is like road transport consumption will

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:25.240
probably reach 2019 levels by the end of 2021. But air transport won't. And air transport is going to take

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.680
longer to come back of people aren't flying. And that's a, it's had a huge impact. Yes, we move a

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:36.280
lot of stuff by cargo, but we move far more people by air. And so the number of airplanes that are still

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:42.680
parked and the decrease in consumption all around is, it's not small. And so in that sense, our emissions

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.760
have dropped a non-trivial amount in the process. And the good news is when that power consumption drop

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:55.160
happened, the power plants that got turned off were the dirtiest ones. So coal consumption went

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.240
drowned dramatically in 2020 because power consumption went down.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:14:59.880
That's really good.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.960
I mean, it makes sense that that was the plants that they turned off, except in China.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:10.920
China actually added coal consumption because China could increase their power consumption

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:16.200
throughout the pandemic. They also, I mean, he gave fair credit to China. While there may have been 50%

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.960
of the increase in coal consumption in 2020, there were also 50% of the increase in renewables over 2020.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.600
So I mean, China is growing very rapidly. They are building out a lot of infrastructure

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.840
and they did not stop through the pandemic.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.600
They did a better job of containing the pandemic as well.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.800
I don't know if that's true. What they certainly did was did a good job of containing any data about

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.040
their pandemic.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.240
Yeah. Okay. Fair.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:46.040
They also have the freedom. That's not the right word. They have the flexibility to impose rules

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.680
differently than the suggestions that we have like in North America and Europe.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.360
Well, and one of the big cases is like the whole world has benefited from the fact that the Chinese

00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.760
government chose to simply build gigantic solar power plants to manufacture solar at a massive scale

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.520
and drove the price down with solar. Yeah.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:08.680
It probably wasn't the most economically efficient way to go about it, but it's the advantage of having

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.800
you know, the sort of strict single party rule system that says thou shalt build big

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.800
solar factories and they did. Yeah.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.080
Yeah. And again,

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.600
sent the price of solar to the floor to the, to the point where we now in the West use solar differently.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:28.600
You know, once upon a time, solar panels were so precious, you put them on articulated arms to aim

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:34.520
them perfectly at the sun throughout the day to maximize utilization. These days, you don't do that

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.800
because those arms are fragile. They break and they're expensive. Yeah.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.920
And for a lot. And so when Germany did this huge push towards solar, as they started to try and wind

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.600
down their nuclear power, they were putting all of these solar panels in all aimed south because they're

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.480
in the north, you know, fairly far north and they get the most light if they're physically aimed south

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.080
until they were generating so much power at the middle of the day when they didn't need it,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.320
that it was actually a problem for their grid. And they don't do that anymore. They now point their

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:07.000
panels east and west, which seems foolish because it means you get less utilization per panel. But what

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.560
you're actually doing is smoothing out your power generation. You don't need as much power at noon.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.600
What you need is more power in the morning and more power in the evening and moving those panels,

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.520
using each panel less efficiently actually makes a more efficient grid.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:26.280
How interesting. So I think the area I really want to focus on with our conversation is that storage

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.000
side, because I think that's the magic of unlocking things.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.560
Sure.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.280
Before we do, have you seen Project Sunroof?

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.520
I have. It doesn't work in Canada, unfortunately.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.880
That is unfortunate. The sun is totally different there or no, just kidding.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.280
Well, you know, it has a U in his name. So, you know, what are you going to do?

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:49.320
Yeah, yeah. So this thing lets you go to your address or anyone's address and click on it and say,

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.760
it gives you a heat map of the roof of your house for the amount of energy it's going to receive.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.480
And unfortunately here, you know, I'm also in the Pacific Northwest. And one of the things that I think

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:06.600
is glorious about here is, you know, right in my yard, I have 150 year old trees that are super high,

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.280
right? Which are amazing. Unless you want solar radiation on your house.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.040
Unless you want sunlight to hit places.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.360
Yes.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.040
Exactly. There's like a little sliver.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.480
Or Starlink for that matter.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.120
Yeah, both are out for me. Like, I actually had some solar people come out and estimate,

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.840
and I said, does it make any sense to, I mean, like, put the money aside. Does it even make sense

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.600
just from a climate perspective? And they're like, you know what? It's going to take five years to

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.080
pay off the carbon and manufacturing just the panels. And I go, right.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.920
It's like too inefficient to justify it, unfortunately.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:44.040
But yeah, yields are just too low. And it's like, if you really wanted to reduce your carbon footprint,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.880
spending that money on the best appliance, the most efficient appliances you could have.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.440
Right. Or redoing your installation or something like that.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:58.360
Yeah. Or even using things like Tesla Powerwall to run on battery during peak power consumption times.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.400
Those things represent the problem with most grid power is that it pretty much generates the same

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.560
amount of power all the time. Grid is not that flexible. It takes a while to spin up those big power

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:13.480
power plants. And so they produce for peak. And if so, if most people, you know, the concept of

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:19.960
Powerwall was, hey, if I can take you off the grid during peak, if I can store power at the cheap times,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.680
and then use that power at the peak times, we can turn off a peak power plant.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.000
Talk Python To Me is partially supported by our training courses.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.120
Do you want to learn Python, but you can't bear to subscribe to yet another service?

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.080
At Talk Python Training, we hate subscriptions too.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:42.600
That's why our course bundle gives you full access to the entire library of courses for one fair price.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.720
That's right. With the course bundle, you save 70% off the full price of our courses, and you own them all forever.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:55.800
That includes courses published at the time of the purchase, as well as courses released within about a year of the bundle.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:09.400
It seems completely reasonable.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.240
Power Pack that Tesla does.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.800
Yeah, I mean, it's not a lot of success. There's been a few. I mean, Australia being the famous.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.320
Yeah, that's the one I was thinking of, for sure.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:23.160
Yeah, they just had a big fire at one of them in terms of, you know, lithium-ion, ion burns prolifically.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:29.560
Yeah, I was going to call that one. Where was that one? That was, yeah, that one was definitely, I guess I can't pull it up.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.440
The biggest advantage of battery over all storage methods, period, is recovery.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:42.680
That it comes about 90% efficient. So put 100 kilowatts in, you'll get 90 kilowatts out in exchange for expensive.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:50.360
That's the issue, is that they're expensive installations. They do have fire risks. The availability of lithium is constrained.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:21:01.160
Although we're starting to see some other battery technologies come down the pipe. The famous, the big news stories at the moment are around iron-based batteries.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:08.120
So liquid iron, it's not, the iron's not liquid, but it's a liquid electrolyte iron battery. Essentially rust batteries.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:15.000
So you, when you oxidize the iron, you can move, you can store electricity and then you deoxidize to release the electricity.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.360
Oh, interesting. It's almost like electrolysis, but applied to iron.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:24.680
Yeah, and it's the same. And fundamentally that's what all batteries are, right? It's doing a chemical reaction that creates new compounds.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:31.960
You're not going to find iron batteries in your phone anytime soon. They are big, they are heavy, but they are very grid scale.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:37.960
The most advanced batteries that I've seen that seem to have the best backing right now are a company called Form Energy.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.120
Okay.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:49.560
So they've raised about $125 million, which seems like a lot. And it is in this space, but grid scale power is hundreds of millions of dollars. So they haven't got a deal yet.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:22:00.120
But it had some breakthroughs in their battery. Their typical battery unit is about the size of a dishwasher. So again, that's, it wouldn't be good for a car, wouldn't be good for a phone.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:14.040
It's also because it has a liquid in it. Its orientation really matters. So these are meant to be held in place, mounted on the ground. They run pretty hot. Not a sort of thing you want to be around, but they're cheap.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:30.980
Like typically with lithium ion batteries today, we're coming in around a hundred, it may be as low as $80 a kilowatt. And believe me, like when a hundred dollars a kilowatt was reached for vehicle class batteries, that was considered the point where now we are price competitive with internal combustion cars.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.200
Right.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.860
And that breakthrough was like in the past couple of years, these iron batteries are coming in at like $20 a kilowatt.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.140
Wow.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:37.620
So.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.940
Are they more stable than the lithium ones as well?

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:58.540
Yeah. They're far less fire risk and slow, steady discharging. So one of the claims to fame for the form energy battery is full discharge took a hundred hours. So the idea that, again, if you think about what is a grid want, it's that ability to have stable power all of the time.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:28.240
And so being able to count on a long duration battery makes a lot of sense. So this is not the kind of battery you'd want in your home. Like we have this home based, Hey, we're going to spend less on the grid. We're going to put some solar panels in. We're going to put some power walls in and we'll use the grid as backup and take less pressure off of that. But grid scale power storage, you're starting to see different kinds of storage system. And this is the first battery technology I've seen. It's really based on grid style storage and has that really high efficiency rating, but it's not the only way to store power.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:49.440
Yeah. Yeah. Before we move off to the, just the battery side, I do want to ask you, if you use your crystal ball and look into the future, do you see a world where we've got renewable energy locally generated, like on roofs in California and maybe a power wall on a house? Like I could see California mandating every house comes with some sort of local battery.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.780
Yeah. And they have mandated solar. You now have to apply for a permit to not put solar on your house.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.580
Which is perfect.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:07.020
It's cool. You know, I mean, California has often done these kinds of things. The battery technology is a little trickier. They are expensive. They are relatively fragile. But yeah, it's possible, but it's easier solved with grid.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:15.220
Yeah. I was going to say, do you see that future or do you see a future where we've got, you know, massive grid scale type of generation and storage?

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:26.440
Yeah. I think it's going to be lots of both because there's good reasons for both. Now, and one of the challenges here, when you start thinking about this micro grid behavior of having homes able to be on the grid is the grid needs to get much smarter.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:41.900
We need internet technology applied to electrical generation and utilization because it's a peer to peer kind of problem. And I mean, we're in computing, so we get that. But if you go talk to people who've worked in power grids all their life, peer is bizarre to them, right?

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:51.620
They're very much a fewest number of power plants necessary to supply the load and a single set of wires to feed it out. Redundancy is an expensive, often unnecessary thing.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:59.540
And so, but that is clearly changing is where we are creating more automation. So I think people will have a choice on how they want to consume in that respect.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:14.880
But we're starting to perfect grid power storage and mostly because our renewables don't deliver a levelized load. They deliver when they deliver. And we need to levelize with other strategies. And that's where storage comes into play.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:32.820
All right. Two other things really quick, maybe one altogether. So we had a lot of resistance in the US to putting up windmills, wind farms off the East Coast, because the people with their yachts, when they went a little farther out, they would see the windmills and they really hated it.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:53.140
And then out in the desert in Nevada, though, what would have been a tremendously large solar grid scale solar is canceled because the electric, the article headline is the US largest solar farm is canceled because Nevada locals don't want to look at it while they're out on their all train vehicles, which I love riding all train vehicles.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.240
I'm not against that. But, you know, it seems like some trade offs that are necessary.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:09.180
Yeah. I mean, people, there is always an NIMBY effect. What's interesting about a place like Nevada and New Mexico is that they could be, they're doing heliosolar. So rather than using photovoltaic, they're using reflectors to heat molten salt.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:23.240
And what's interesting about that at that scale is the salt gets so hot that it still generates power through the night. You know, I mean, there's a bunch of ways to use molten salt. It's used in nuclear reactors. It's used in power storage systems. It's used in heliosystems.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:43.400
The thing that's powerful about salts, whatever they may be, sodium-based salts, fluorine-based salts, doesn't really matter, is that their operating liquid temperature, the temperature that they turn from a solid into a liquid is around 400 degrees Celsius. It varies from material to mineral. But their boiling point when they'll turn into a gas is past 1500 degrees.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:43.980
Yeah.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:27:05.820
So you have this huge operating range of liquid, right, as opposed to water, which only has a hundred degree range. And I'm using Celsius, because I'm a civilized human, for the liquid range. And that's not a lot of range. So the advantage being, I can do flash steam turbines against 500 degree Celsius salts just as easily as I can do against 800 degree salts and so forth.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.980
And so they carry heat long enough that you can bridge nighttime with it.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.680
Right. So that's even a form of storage, in a sense. But in the coast, yeah.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:19.560
There is a mechanism, like, if we have more solar than we know what to do with, why don't we switch it to heaters to heat the salt up?

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.420
Because after it gets past a certain temperature threshold, it'll generate a lot of electricity.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:30.460
Now, it's not, because of that floor, that minimum temperature, molten salt storage is not as efficient as battery storage.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:44.200
Battery storage comes in at 90%. Molten salts come in at 70%. On the other hand, they're very persistent. They are less, you know, they've got a lot fewer risks. They're a well-known technology. So if you have the materials, it's a good solution.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:53.240
But there are more, right? Like, for years, we've been using pumped hydro storage, where you use that excess electricity to pump water up a hill. And then when you need it, you let the water come back down.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:59.400
Right. So, yeah. So let's talk about some of the ones that are not straight of battery, right? So, like you said, that one's been pretty popular.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.040
Been around a long time.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:13.040
Yeah. I was really blown away when I first heard about that. So the idea is you might be at the face of a mountain, and there might be a mountain lake up right there. So you could have a lake at the bottom and a lake at the top.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:21.660
And as you generate the energy, all the extra just pumps the water to the top. And then when you let it out, you run it through some kind of hydroelectric thing on the way to...

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:32.200
Put it through a turbine on the way back down, you get the power. And that's got about an 80% return. So more efficient than molten salt, not as efficient as battery. It's terrain specific. You need to have a handy mountain.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:44.020
Now, there's another gravity solution that doesn't need a mountain. It's called crane-based storage, where they use a very tall crane, and they use the electric power to lift concrete blocks and stack them higher and higher and higher.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:51.260
And then when you want to discharge the power, you pick the block up and let it come down and spin a turbine, spin a generator to generate electricity from it.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.560
That's kind of nouveau. The current efficient...

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:54.560
Yeah.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:59.680
Nobody's built one to scale yet, but the experimental ones, again, coming in in the 80% range.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:09.480
So there's challenges with the water one, right? You're moving water up high, and what if the dam or the pipes were to break and to flood the city that it was near?

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:09.920
Yeah.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.640
Or there's a drought, all sorts of things.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:17.320
It's also, there's only so much water you can pump up. Like, what happens when you run out of water? What happens when you run out of room? Like, now it's going to over...

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:22.220
Typically, they're dammed water storage. Like, the dam can only hold so much, too. So it has limits.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:39.280
Where the crane-based ones, as long as the crane can reach the blocks and doesn't get past its leverage moments, you can put a lot of blocks in place. You can build the crane larger. You can put its arm out longer. So that's interesting. Although they're going to be more expensive and have more maintenance than your typical hydro pump solution.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:49.400
Yeah. You can build more cranes. You could dig a hole in the ground and have this giant block of concrete or whatever go up and down, you know, hundreds of meters underground, right?

00:29:49.560 --> 00:30:05.240
Yeah. Well, lots of blocks, right? So when you have excess power, your lifting blocks is stacking them high and then, and more and more and more of them. And then when you need the power, you're letting them come back down one after the other. You have to levelize the power. Like, there's some tricks to it. It's not a simple solution, but it works anywhere that you've got some flat land.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.320
Yeah. Which, with a bulldozer, is almost anywhere.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.860
Yeah. With some enthusiasm and some dynamite, you can make anything flat.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:19.540
That's right. So that seems like a really good solution. And so this is the thing that I really am excited to talk to you about.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:36.040
Because I get so frustrated when I hear things like, well, it would be great if this pipe dream you had could come true and you could run stuff on solar and wind, but it's never going to work because I want to watch TV at night and not be cold at night.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:36.540
Right.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:51.800
So it doesn't work. It's never, it's unstable. And there's all this creative stuff going on like pumped hydro, like molten salt, like we could just dig a hole in the ground and use some really complicated, like transmission. Yeah.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:31:04.980
You know, you take the mixture of the iron-based batteries, the $20 per kilowatt hour battery with winded solar, which are now so cheap and have grown a lot through the pandemic too.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.720
They're now the second largest source of power.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.960
And, you know, they've had the biggest growth.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:17.100
Admittedly, the largest renewable is still hydroelectric, but solar and wind are growing rapidly and had been very, very successful.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:17.400
Yeah.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:23.200
That the offshore wind power movement is an interesting one where they're getting not just in the water.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:31.300
Right now, when they go in the water with wind power, they're doing nearshore, not too deep, 100 feet, 200 feet, stuff they can anchor to the bottom on.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:37.760
But they've now hit a point where they're ready to start using more of the oil rig technologies to do floating turbines.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:43.900
So now you can go a couple of hundred miles offshore or more off the continental shelf and run the turbines out there.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:59.300
Yeah. Two of the challenges that I saw when I was thinking about that was one, you've got to dig down into the ground and you're disturbing the ecosystem of oysters and whatever, right, that like might be there if you're going to mount these things to the ground.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.500
The other is with these giant windmills.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:10.280
And when I was in Germany, we were around these huge windmills all over and just the sense of being near them is really crazy.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:10.540
Oh, yeah.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.160
They're ominous.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:22.180
And believe me, the offshore ones, I mean, twice the wingspan of 747, like these 10 megawatt turbines, they're so big, you can't even get your head around how big they are.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:22.480
Yeah.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.160
They're just titans.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.420
They're just incredibly large.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:34.060
But to have them on a floating platform away from everyone where the noise isn't, where the sea life is not as plentiful, where the seabirds are not as plentiful.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:34.160
Yeah.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:41.400
That's what I was going to say is the other one is people would say, look, these are harmful to all the birds because there's so many bird strikes.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.500
But, you know, 10 miles offshore, there's not that much bird traffic.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.680
Well, now we're talking 200 miles offshore.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:46.920
Okay.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.700
Even further.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.600
You're well, you're off the end of the continental shelf.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.900
So you're way out there.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.400
The bird traffic is substantially lower.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.260
And that's a far less disruptive technology all around.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.180
It increases costs.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.100
But the equipment's getting cheaper.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.040
And the power generation is valuable.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.480
And it's, you know, minimally disruptive.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.380
They're smart enough to survive severe weather.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.660
So, you know, that's continuing to grow dramatically.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.140
Yeah.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:13.780
For a reason.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:21.320
And taking the known technology for working offshore and turning it into automated platforms for wind makes a lot of sense.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:21.660
Yeah.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:22.280
Absolutely.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:32.520
So when I, circling back around, when I hear people in the news or whatever say, oh, we can't have this renewable future because there is so much fluctuation and uncertainty.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.020
I feel like it's just a lack of creativity.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.580
These are old arguments.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.260
We've been solving them steadily.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:39.760
Exactly.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.200
Like, we put people on the moon with, like, wristwatch level computing.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:44.980
Surely.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:45.300
Yeah.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.440
We can build some cranes or build some batteries and put.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:49.820
Yeah.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.040
Well, and we also did it in a very dangerous way.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.000
The way we sent people to the moon was extremely risky.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.760
That's why we stopped.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.700
Yeah.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.500
We want power that's safe and reliable.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.260
And that's fairly hard.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.800
And we'd be remiss not to talk a little bit about nuclear.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.420
Because nuclear can be safe.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:04.900
Yeah.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.340
It just hasn't been.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.000
We stopped spending money on it.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.200
We stopped spending money almost at the moment that we were moving beyond.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.200
Yeah.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:19.880
Like, water-based nuclear, where stuff would fail safer rather than Fukushima-type fail.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.400
Sure.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.320
Well, here's the funny thing about Fukushima.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.920
There was actually six reactors in Fukushima.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.320
We only, and people only talk about one to four.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.380
Four was offline, and one through three melted down.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.920
Nobody talks about five and six.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.240
Five and six were exactly the same design.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.900
But they had been modernized to have passive cooldown.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:47.780
And so when they were scrammed the same way one through four were, and then they lost their generators, just like one through four were, they cooled down on their own without events.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:48.380
Oh, interesting.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.260
I didn't realize that.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:49.800
That's cool.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.160
Yeah.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.800
And they're undamaged, right?

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.500
Now, the question is, why didn't one through four have passive cooldown?

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:06.140
Because one through four were several years older, and the upgrade kits to make them passively cool down were expensive and took two years to install.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:13.900
And since the plants only had about five, six years of lifespan with them, it was a financial decision not to install the passive cooldowns by TEPCO.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.240
Probably something they want to take back if they could.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:16.800
Yeah.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.920
But, you know, that's true of a lot of things.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:27.240
You know, I'm pretty sure in Three Mile Island, the operators had asked for an indicator of light for the pressure relief valve to show it was open or closed.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.240
And they put the light in, but they wired it to the switch, not to the valve.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.940
So when you push the button, the light turned on.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.060
You push the button, the light turned off.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.260
Nobody knew what the valve was doing.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:34.660
Yeah.

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:41.960
The valve sat open and allowed water to escape from the vessel until the point where the core was exposed and partially melted down.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.200
Yeah.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.940
You know, people make mistakes.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.560
But part of this is reactor size.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:53.620
The push to make reactors in the 300 megawatt class because that's the size of the coal power plants.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.520
They knew how to operate that size.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.900
They knew how the turbines worked.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.260
So they made these bigger nuclear reactors.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.200
And that's problematic because they are hard to cool down.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.400
Now, we've learned to cool them down with more modern versions.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:10.360
But as soon as you shrink them down to a more natural size, to the 60 megawatt class, you just don't have that problem.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:10.620
Yeah.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:16.800
And those are the reactors you find in aircraft carriers and in submarines, those kinds of places.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.140
And that's what you're seeing in small modular nuclear reactors are the 60 megawatt class.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:27.240
And these are the kind of reactors that you build in a factory rather than build on site.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.740
So they're not bespoke.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.620
They're standardized.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.000
They're built with machines.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:31.940
They're consistent.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.520
They're easy to test and validate.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.380
And so they're very reliable.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:37.060
You fuel them once.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.660
They run for 20 years on the fuel.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.300
So no refueling every year.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.320
You run them solid for 20 years.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.720
They are passively shut down because they're small enough.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.360
If you put the control rods in place, they will simply go cold.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.020
And so the folks, I think, are furthest along in the modular nuclear.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.500
They actually got their clearance contracts.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:59.880
They got certified by the Atomic Energy Association last year is new scale.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.420
And they actually have a contract in Utah to build out the first modular plant.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:15.000
And their plan is to actually put 12 of these together on the site so that you get that same kind of 300, 400 megawatt power generation that is normal in grid.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.580
But they just have multiple small redundant reactors that they can swap them out as they need to be replaced.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.440
And when you at the end of 20 years, you don't refuel it.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:24.340
You remove it.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.840
You lift it back out of the ground.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.480
You take it back to a factory where it is reprocessed.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.760
And you put a new one in place.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.040
Yeah.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.780
This is a very different approach to nuclear.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:33.060
Yeah.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.800
Going to have to break a lot of stereotypes and fears.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.220
Yes.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:37.520
Right.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.060
But, you know, the Atomic Energy Association has now signed on with that one.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.220
So because it has passed.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:52.040
And so the Utah project, by the way, is struggling now for new scale for the simple reason that costs have gone up.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.520
And so some of the municipalities that signed on to buy power for them are now finding out the new power price is higher.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.220
And they're like, hey, I can get a natural gas plant for less than that.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.020
Like, why am I paying for this?

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.940
And that's part of the challenge here.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.920
Price is everything.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.800
And solar is getting cheaper.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.860
Wind is getting cheaper.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.760
Natural gas has always been cheap.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:18.360
So these guys are always struggling with, as they develop these new technologies, they're trying to get those costs absorbed by their early sales.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.580
And people don't want to pay for it.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:19.780
Yeah.

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.660
It's a tough chicken and egg, right?

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.700
So let's talk about some more storage.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:29.320
I do think the nuclear side is really interesting because it's been shunned so badly since the 70s.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.440
But it is carbon.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.400
It's zero carbon, right?

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.000
Yeah.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.920
I mean, you've got to mine.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.860
It does not emit carbon.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.140
Yeah.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:36.560
Yeah.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.060
Exactly.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:41.300
You know, it consumes carbon to if you're going to mine uranium, refine uranium, ship uranium.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.040
Like, those are issues.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.420
It still has a consumable.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:50.120
Although the efficiency of that consumable, it's hard to get your head around how efficient it is in comparison.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:50.460
Yeah.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:57.740
How little you refine uranium it takes to run a power plant compared to the amount of coal or natural gas it takes to run a power plant.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:01.600
And the problem is that the reactor design that's most mature that most people are familiar with.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:07.520
So pressurized water designs, light water designs, were really meant to produce plutonium.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.660
Like, the reason that the United States matured that technology was to make bombs.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.940
They make electricity.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.500
While they're making electricity, they get plutonium out of their cores.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:24.140
And so it was designed to be disassembled every six months, have the cores reprocessed, get the plutonium out, make new cores, and load them back in again.

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.240
And then they stopped reprocessing cores.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:34.700
During the Ford administration, when Carter was running against them with anti-nuclear proliferation, Ford's attempt to get reelected, he said,

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.620
I'll do what Jimmy wants us to do and stop reprocessing cores.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.820
And America has never reprocessed a fuel core since.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.840
They just store them at the plant.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.260
And it was just a political game.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:43.860
No.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:51.140
The French, who 80% of their power comes from pressurized water and nuclear, have continued to modernize their plants.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.980
They always have reprocessed their cores.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.720
In fact, they now reprocess plutonium into their cores.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.940
It's called a MOX core.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.040
And so they're actually burning plutonium.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.260
And so they don't have the radiation storage problems.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.180
They're not because they're reprocessing their fuel.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:12.700
And, you know, by the way, when Germany decided to stop using their nuclear plants after Fukushima, to have enough power, they bought nuclear power from France.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.920
Like, that's how that worked.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.280
Yeah.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.260
Modernizing.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.900
Not that, you know, nuclear plants have their problems.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.300
And they need to be modernized.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.140
And they need to be more efficient than they are.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.080
And there are better technologies that still should be matured.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:32.000
But these small modulars deal with most of that and with relatively little new research needed to be done.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.180
And still it's a struggle.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:33.460
Yeah.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.520
Super interesting.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.280
So we only have about five minutes left.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:50.280
But I do want to talk about some more energy storage stuff that's really interesting that people maybe don't think about is, what if I just got a giant, really balanced piece of steel and spun it really fast?

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.260
Or something like that.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.060
The flywheel solution.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:53.560
Exactly.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.900
Well, and modern flywheels are better than ever.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.020
These days they use air bearings.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.220
Some of them have even seen versions that have superconductive bearings.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.640
So that they, and then they're in vacuum.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.020
So the whole trick with a flywheel is minimizing friction.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.020
Like, how fast can we get it spinning and stay in shape?

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.120
And how long do we extract it?

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.780
Now, they're not as efficient as batteries.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.520
They're close.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.700
80, 85.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.300
They have their own mechanicals, like the stuff that needs to be taken care of.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.620
But essentially they're a part of a motor.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:27.600
Like, you only have to put a field coil around that flywheel to extract power from it.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.320
So they're expensive to manufacture.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.400
And they take specialized operators to run.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.800
Batteries in some respects, while expensive also, are easier.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.920
But these are, flywheels have been around a long time.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:45.900
When I was a kid and trying to get computer time in the university, that computer's backup system was a flywheel for power.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:46.360
Oh, wow.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:46.680
Really?

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.020
200 kilowatt set of flywheels.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:48.300
Yeah.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.880
We went down to the flywheel room one time.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.540
And you talk about that threatening hum.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:57.080
Flywheels hum in a way that lets you know, if something goes wrong here, you're not even going to feel it.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:02.280
When flywheels disintegrate, that's a lot of mass moving in a hurry.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:02.600
Yeah.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.340
So they are interesting machines.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.320
And they're an interesting approach to storing power.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:14.040
I think each of these power storage solutions, you know, has merit depending on where you are and what materials are expensive at the time.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.940
You know, flywheels count on heavy ferrous metals being inexpensive.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:24.340
And those sophisticated bearing systems to allow them to spin well and good field coil control so that they can spin them up and spin them down.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:24.620
Yeah.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.000
They're absolutely viable.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.180
I feel like they've gotten modernized quite a bit recently.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:28.740
Mm-hmm.

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:35.480
Well, everybody, it is the Rebco superconductive bearings that made a huge difference.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.780
Because you're floating on a baron with no friction because it's not touching anything.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.320
It's in evacuated space.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.280
That basically means you get up to speed.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.480
And the way you, like you said, you extract energy is through magnetic stuff.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.680
Yeah.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.000
So there's no physical contact.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.600
Yeah.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.260
Yeah.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:49.860
That's fantastic.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:50.220
Yeah.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.760
It's a very modern way to think.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.660
But they make sense at a grid level.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.260
They need to be large.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.240
They need to be professionally operated and professionally maintained.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:58.600
Yeah.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.740
The other one, I'm not sure if I have a picture of it here, actually.

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:02.640
I don't think I do.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:09.560
The other one has to do with not storing water, but storing compressed air.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.080
Yeah.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:18.000
So where we see these are where they have airtight, large spaces, like old salt mines,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.200
for example, where they've done mining the salt, but effectively the space is airtight

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.820
and so they can pump pressure into them.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.400
They have efficiency problems because you have sort of have a minimum pressure.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.440
So you've got to pump for a while before you get to a pressure that would spin a turbine.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.480
They come in in the 70% range, a little bit lower.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:40.060
But if you have the space, like the expensive part would be making the tank, right?

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:40.420
Right.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.600
Pumps are not that expensive and not that difficult.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:48.600
You know, but if you've got a huge volume of airtight space, it's worth utilizing that.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.460
Let me throw one other idea at you.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:50.780
Okay.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.560
You know, there's one hand, there's the idea of we're generating electricity and we need

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.260
to store it for when we can't generate it.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.260
Then there's also the we're generating more electricity we need.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.600
Where do we put this?

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:00.860
Yeah.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.840
But if you didn't need it for electricity, like why would you bother storing it into battery?

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.640
Can you turn excess electricity into something valuable?

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:13.600
And so one of the areas of research going on right now is water desalinization.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.640
We have a freshwater problem.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:15.980
Yeah.

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:21.800
So why not, when you have excess electricity available, use electricity to salinate water.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:27.480
If you're turning that excess power into something valuable, freshwater.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.120
There's a version of this, it's actually a kind of pump storage solution.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:38.020
So we pump seawater up to a high level and then the drain system for that to lower it back

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:43.100
down again actually has a reverse osmosis filter on it and just uses gravity to extract the fresh

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:43.400
water.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:43.820
Yeah.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:44.320
How interesting.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:50.560
So taking existing designs of pumped power storage and instead of using a turbine without

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.420
water coming down, using it to extract fresh water from salt.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.480
Well, that's a lot of options.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.860
A lot of different flexibilities for where you're located.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.360
Are you by a mountain lake?

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.080
Do you have an old mine?

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:03.620
Yeah.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.340
Or do you do a standard pumped reverse osmosis is another solution.

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.560
It just consumes more energy.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:08.840
Yeah.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.420
But if you have the excess energy, why not?

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.420
And if you need the water.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:11.640
Yeah.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.680
Water desalinization is getting more popular all the time.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.460
You think about the drought that's going on in Southern California.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:20.660
The Israelis are leading the world in water desalinization.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:21.800
It's a desert climate.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.280
It has water problems, but they don't have a water problem anymore.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.960
About 25% of their water is now desalinized water.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.480
They use the reverse osmosis systems for it.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.940
The challenge is that most of these mechanisms take a while to get a lot of energy.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:34.940
get up to speed.

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:40.840
So, you know, it can take a day to get a reverse osmosis system stabilized and pumping well.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.320
And if you're trying to use like the three-hour window where you're making too much solar,

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.880
you don't have, the system's not efficient for that, for making water.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.140
Yeah.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.660
It doesn't respond fast enough, right?

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:56.020
So there's a push to modernize, to update these systems so that you have a 20-minute uptime.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.160
Within 20 minutes, we can be making water with this.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.440
So that three-hour window in midday where we have more solar we don't do with,

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.800
we can put it over to the reverse osmosis plant and make fresh water with it.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.120
Awesome.

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:05.400
Yeah.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.040
Well, Richard, thank you so much for being here and sharing all these ideas and doing the research

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:10.560
for us.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.000
Yeah.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.620
You said it's a pleasure when you ask me because these are all notes I'm keeping,

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:18.340
but then I spend a few days sorting them out into a set of narratives.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.380
Like, what are the important bits of all that?

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.540
So it's a pleasure for me too.

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:22.460
And really fun to talk to you.

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:22.660
Yeah.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:23.260
Yeah.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.320
It's always great to have you here.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.480
And who knows what we'll talk about next time, but it's great.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.620
Well, since Coke says there's a subject at me, you know, I'm interested in everything.

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.940
I do know that for sure.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:32.480
All right.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.200
So thank you for being here as always.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.840
And yeah, have a good day.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.200
And hey, we actually made this work from space.

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:39.680
Yeah.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.020
Yeah.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.980
It was a little cranky at the beginning and it seemed to held out after that.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.220
That's right.

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.100
All right.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:45.620
Bye, Richard.

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:46.020
See ya.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.980
This has been another episode of Talk Python To Me.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.800
Our guest in this episode was Richard Camel.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.840
And it's been brought to you by us over at Talk Python Training.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.760
And the transcripts are brought to you by Assembly AI.

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.960
Do you need a great automatic speech to text API?

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.500

Want to level up your Python?

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:13.180
We have one of the largest catalogs of Python video courses over at Talk Python.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:18.360
Our content ranges from true beginners to deeply advanced topics like memory and async.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.020
And best of all, there's not a subscription in sight.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.920
