You've heard that software developers and startups go hand in hand, but what about data scientists?

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.880
Of course they do. But how do you turn your data science skill set into a data science

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.460
business skill set? What are some of the areas ripe for launching such a business into?

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.200
On this episode, I welcome back four prior guests who have all walked their own version of this path

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.060
and are currently running successful Python-based data science startups.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.540
Ines Montani from Explosion AI, Matthew Rockland from Coiled, Jonathan Morgan from Yonder AI,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.240
and William Stein from CoCalc. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 300, recorded January 7th, 2021.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:55.780

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.780
been here before, so I should say welcome back. William Stein, Matthew Rocklin, Jonathan Morgan,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.460
and Ines Montani. Welcome.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.340
Thanks for having us.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.680
Thank you.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.600
Yeah, I'm happy to be here.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.920
Yeah, thanks. Great to be back.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.440
Yeah, it's great to be back with you all talking. And you all have done some really,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.060
really cool work around creating something out of this open source community, some products,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.120
some platforms, some tools that people can use. And so many folks have asked me, hey,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.520
if I'm a data scientist, how could I do something like that? How could I create an API, a library,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.020
a company that maybe I could slowly make more of a job and less of a hobby? So I think it's

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.200
going to be great to get some insight from each and every one of you on that one.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.620
Maybe more of a job than you actually want.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.300
Yeah, exactly. It's a job with a lot of flexibility, but not necessarily a lot of time off,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.780
more like slower and more intense time. So I guess maybe let's just start with a little bit of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.220
background. You all have been on the show, like I said, a lot of people are familiar with all of your

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.440
work. But let's just go around. Maybe William, start with you. Just a quick bit of background

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.980
about yourself.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.960
I've been really into programming since the 80s. I did a PhD in mathematics, which I finished in 2000.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.300
And then I was a math professor for about 17 years, Harvard, UC San Diego, University of Washington,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.280
doing number three. And along the way, I founded SageMath, which is an open source math software project.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.020
And I also launched Cython, which is a way of making Python faster. Though I didn't start it,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.940
I just launched it. I came up with the name and got various people to really make it a big deal.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.900
Oh, wow. I had no idea. We use Cython very heavily. I didn't realize.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.380
The predecessor of Cython Pyrex was the reason I chose Python for Sage as to other languages.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.280
And then I put a lot of work into getting the project off the ground and more popular.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.100
That's super cool. Cython really should be used more. I think it makes such

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.700
a difference in the right use case.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.200
Yeah. And it is used a lot, which is awesome. Yeah.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.440
It's used everywhere. Yeah.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.000
Yeah. Actually, I often tell people like, you know, if we check which libraries that you use on a daily

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.960
basis, actually use Cython under the horn, you'd be surprised.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.260
Yeah.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.200
In 2012, I started something that I initially called SageMath Cloud and then later CoCalc,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.700
which is what I'm doing full time now. And that was about trying to make it easy for

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.320
people to use SageMath and lots and lots of other software through their web browser collaboratively.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.380
That's why you're here today, because you've done some great stuff there. Matthew Rocklin.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.380
Yeah. Briefly, I was in grad school for scientific computing things. I went to work at National

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.380
Labs for a bit and then quit and went to Anaconda, or Continuum at the time, which is sort of a

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.000
for-profit Python company. A bunch of us sort of converged in Anaconda when Python was really

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.440
taking off. While I was there, I started working on a project called Dask for parallel computing.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.720
So I generally think about how to take Python and make it run on many computers efficiently

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.660
and how to like take all of-

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.020
Dask is like pandas without limits, in a sense.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.340
There's big pandas, but there's other stuff too. I think a lot of Dask's work is actually

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.940
not just accelerating pandas, but accelerating like the thousand packages that we all work

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.620
on together in this ecosystem. So about half of my effort has been technological and about

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.640
half of my effort has been sort of more social, cultural.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.140
Fantastic.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.460
I then went to NVIDIA for, I was at Anaconda for a long time. I went to NVIDIA for a year,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.140
worked on Rapids, sort of like a GPU data science thing with Dask, built out the Dask team there.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.480
And then about a year ago, I split off and made Coiled, which is a company based around it.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.900
Yeah. Awesome. I'm looking forward to talking about Coiled with you as well. Jonathan Morgan.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.060
It's been too long since you've been on the show, by the way.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.100
It has. It's been a little while. So my background's a little bit different. I was a self-taught,

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.860
very much a generalist. I was a self-taught software engineer in the early 2000s. When people started to

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.420
win web development was beneath a serious software engineer, I was like happy to do it. I was like,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.860
great. If it's beneath you, like I can probably teach it to myself. And then really got into Python

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.440
for that reason. That was right around when like Django was popular at the time. And that led to a

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.760
career in, I called it data science. It was probably more like machine learning engineering.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.500
Now that the field has matured and we're getting more specific about what those roles are.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.320
And then most of the people here would probably know me from the podcast that I had called

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.480
partially derivative with Chris Albin and then Vidya Spandana. And we, it was kind of a-

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.620
Yeah, that was a great podcast. Yeah. I enjoyed listening to it.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.740
We had fun. We had fun. I mean, it was about machine learning and also drinking. And recently

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.500
it came back into the public eye because it turns out that John Ossoff was a listener in 2014

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.140
and he tweeted at us and everybody, I got a bunch of notifications on social media and I was like,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.960
I don't know what's going on. And it turns out that everybody was like making jokes about

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.800
this tweet that he made comparing our theme music to the radio from Grand Theft Auto 3.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.120
And it's just a small piece, a small piece of the news of the week. I, you know,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.600
I'm just excited that we were involved.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.080
You're a small part of the political landscape here in Europe.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.220
In a way, we're just like a little bit part of the magic and the victory.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.640
And in terms of actually turning it into a business, eventually turned a project that Chris and I had

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.280
been working on into what we thought would be an automated machine learning company and has since

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.340
been a company focused on using machine learning to identify agenda-driven groups online, misinformation

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.820
and disinformation, helping companies deal with it.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.140
I was joking about your podcast tweet, but you're doing some legitimately important stuff around like

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.760
all this information spreading stuff.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.440
Well, we hope so. We're trying.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.820
Awesome.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.680
Ines.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.060
Yeah.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.840
Hello again.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.000
Happy to have you here.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.900
I'm excited to be back.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.800
And especially because last time I was on your show, I did talk about running a business.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.920
So it's nice to come back maybe, I don't know, is it two years already?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.380
I don't know.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.000
A bit after.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.300
Yeah, it's something like that.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.560
Yeah.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.980
And talk about what we've been up to.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.140
So yeah, basically, I actually, I got into programming via web development as well.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.860
So I don't really have the typical software, engineering, computer science background.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.480
I just spent my teenage years making websites because it was fun.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.080
And then I did media science and linguistics, which kind of had nothing to do with software

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.100
engineering like that.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.700
And I ended up in NLP, natural language processing, by accident because it combined my passions for

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.780
language and programming.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.040
And then Python was the obvious choice.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.500
Obviously, Siphon as well.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.040
And that's how I ended up here.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.820
And then together with my co-founder, Matt, who is also the author of Spacey, we started

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.480
a company in 2016 around it, which is called Explosion.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.420
And yeah, I would say we're probably best known for Spacey, which is an open source library for

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.440
natural language processing in Python.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.340
But we also built other stuff.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.680
We basically built developer tools for machine learning.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.240
So our other commercial product is called Prodigy.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.160
And it's an annotation tool that helps people create training data for models, which is a very

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.200
important aspect as well.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.460
And so that's what we're doing.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.160
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.300
And like Matt, you have this open source library that is forming the kernel or the seed of the

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.320
company that you guys are working on.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.740
So maybe that's a good place to jump into it.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.400
The thing that I want to bring out of this episode for everyone listening, and it's really

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.800
relevant for folks in a data science world, but also I think anyone who is a developer in

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.600
the broad sense, and they want to create their own thing.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.760
They have got some idea, some project that really has to do with developers.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.460
How did you do it?

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.180
What did you create?

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.060
So we're going to talk about your story and how you built it.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.380
So let's just, you know, jump into Explosion.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.800
You mentioned a little bit about it.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.960
What's the history and what is the product that you would say that you guys sell?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.380
Yeah.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.700
So basically, a very quick recap of the history.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.300
It started with my co-founder being in academia, researching computational linguistics and realizing

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.340
that people were using his research code for real world stuff.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.200
And he was like, wait, no, that's not what research code is supposed to do.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.780
It's supposed to print a number at the end.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.320
That's it.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.900
Like, nah, this wasn't made for this.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.760
But it was clear that there was an interest.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.420
So he basically left academia to write Spacey, which is a library that's focused a lot more

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.220
on production use, as opposed to many other research libraries that focus more on doing

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.860
natural language processing research.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.020
And so I met him sort of by accident as well.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:26.240
We started working together, started, I joined the Spacey development core team, which was

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.140
for a very long time, only the two of us.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.720
But we also quickly saw, okay, there's an, we've always planned to start a business around

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:32.920
it.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.380
That was from day one.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.040
We were like, okay, let's actually, there's a lot of money in there.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.460
There's a lot of interest in there.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.420
We can do this.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.480
So then we basically, we launched Prodigy, which is an annotation tool.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.820
And that's our first commercial product.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.580
That's how we started.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.820
That's how we're making money.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.980
So we're basically saying, hey, if you're a power user of our other tools, and we can

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.640
clearly show you, we can build good software, you likely want to train your own models and

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.640
take it one step further.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.440
And we have a product for you.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.800
We have a tool for you that you can use.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.620
And that's the commercial offering.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:07.140
We very much like giving people, you know, we believe that people should have transparent

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.540
tools that enabled them to build custom stuff, not like cloud services or models that they

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.940
can't control or data that they have to send to us that we can then use for something.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.440
And we also think that developers should really own what they ship and what they do.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.780
And yeah, this is also for us, this building, allow providing these types of tools for people

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.200
that really you can just download.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.080
That's the thing with Prodigy.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.400
You literally can buy it, download it, you own it, you have it.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.580
Like back in the day when Adobe still gave you Photoshop, and you had Photoshop, and you're

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.980
like, great, I can work with that.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.380
Now it's all like in the cloud.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.880
I've paid so much money to Adobe for the tools.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.820
And I don't know if next month I'll have it or not.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.140
Do I?

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.880
No, exactly.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.020
And I think for machine learning, that's really backwards, because it's you should be able

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.060
to pick up your project in half a year.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.760
And it should still work.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.980
And it should be able to keep working with the tooling, at least to some extent.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.620
So that's what motivated like our first product.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.340
And it also meant that if we want to run a company that way, we do have to have a sustainable

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.000
business model.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.240
Like we're currently, we're 100% independent, and we're also profitable, which also means

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.220
we can give our user base that sort of security.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.200
And we can say, look, we're a sustainable project.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.840
We're not, you're not the guinea pigs.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.840
We're not treating you as a stepping stone to our grand exit.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.680
And then we're going to shut everything down and leave you alone.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.880
That's not what we're doing here.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.240
Yeah.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.920
I also think you've got a really popular product with Spacey.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:31.560
And I think historically, there's been a lot of apprehension around, well, there's this

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:37.340
commercial thing and it's mixing in with my open source and what evil influence will it

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:37.900
bring in.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.240
But to me, when you've got libraries like that, but you have a company who has a really strongly

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.940
vested interest in that just being better and still keeping it open source, but now you've

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.360
got ways to get more.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.640
I think that's a really positive thing for these open source libraries.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.000
Yeah.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.660
No, and I think that was definitely the motivation.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:58.740
That's also why we didn't do any open call thing where like, oh, parts of the open source

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.460
library are free and then you have to pay if you're like a commercial.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.320
Or support as well.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.880
There's some support that's great, but often it means you only get to provide support if

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.080
your documentation is bad enough that people need support.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.480
And I think that's fundamentally about business models.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:11.980
Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.500
Awesome.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.640
All right.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.040
I'm going to just go along with the tab order in our screen share here.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.020
So Jonathan, tell us about Yonder.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.780
You gave us a hint, as everyone did, where we're going with this.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.600
But the internet is alive, I hear.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:30.080
A long time ago, I started doing some research using early Python machine learning tools to

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.920
try and work with other subject matter experts to get a sense of how extremist groups were

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.120
spreading propaganda, were ratifying the internet.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.380
And so in doing that, we found that there are some patterns to the way that people accomplish

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.500
their agenda on the internet.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.460
In some cases, that agenda is like really nefarious.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.980
Yeah, like one of the things you and I discussed way back in 2016 was, guess what?

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.300
After the, maybe it was 2018, after the election, a whole bunch of the internet social media turned

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.220
out to be bots with their own automated agendas, right?

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:57.840
Right, right.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.100
And I think that was like, I mean, now in the past five or six years, everybody's come to

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.120
accept that this is maybe just how the internet works.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.940
Like a certain amount of it is automated and like sure there's groups that are like trying

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.080
to convince you of something.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.100
Maybe you'd call it propaganda or maybe you just call them like K-pop stans, like screwing

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:13.440
around.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.940
Like everybody's, we kind of get it now.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.980
Like the internet's sort of like Mad Max and it's really different, I think, to how

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.400
everybody might've thought it was when it was more like people taking photos of their

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.380
lunch and putting it on Twitter.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.780
And so the kind of the cool thing that we found was that the same way that you'd go about discovering

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.520
like a group of ISIS supporters was also the way that you'd go about discovering anybody

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.680
who was working together to pursue a shared agenda.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.380
And it turns out that's actually really interesting and really valuable.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.160
And now you get kind of some hints about the subculture of the internet.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.660
Really early on, when the company had a different focus, I thought maybe this would be an

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:47.280
opportunity to actually take the model, like to also build on top of an open source model.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.980
Like we had a way of doing automated exploratory data analysis that we thought was really interesting,

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.960
like heavy on pandas.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.980
We actually started using Dask and Cython towards the end to make it a little faster.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.400
It's awesome.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.180
Like two of the other guests are bringing their creations together.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:00.500
It was me.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:00.900
Yeah.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.820
Yeah, it was awesome.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.080
I don't want deployed Dask services.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.060
I know a company for you.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.180
I've heard of them.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.440
I think they're right down the street.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.660
But then we actually ended up going different direction.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:13.520
Like we found that we were solving what could be a really big problem, potentially like a

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.880
really big market, lots of customers, maybe something that might mature over like 10 or

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.520
20 years.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.240
And so all of a sudden we went from thinking that we maybe had a really cool idea that we

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.680
could build on top of incrementally to maybe a really big idea that we need a lot of money

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.300
to go pursue.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:32.800
And so very, very out of my comfort zone as somebody who spent like my entire career

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.560
focused on tactical products and software engineering was we went out to Silicon Valley and we raised

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.360
a bunch of venture capital.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.080
We kind of went the other way and thought like, all right, like let's go build a high growth,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.100
like a venture backed startup.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.080
And that's what we did.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:45.940
And so we've been doing that.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.500
That was about four years ago that we made that decision.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:55.020
And yeah, the company went from a couple of people coding over Zoom to we've got 25 people.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.600
Actually, we had a little more than that, a little bit larger company than that at one

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:58.820
point.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.640
So it's like, yeah, I don't know.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.520
We've grown pretty quickly.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.120
It's pretty big.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.080
Like my day to day has changed like a thousand percent.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.880
Less time filling JIRA tickets.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.180
Yeah, less time filling JIRA tickets.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.500
And now it's like, if I'm in the code, everybody is uncomfortable.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.440
I've had to learn to, I shouldn't even joke that I will be in the code anymore because now

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.040
we have a team of like really sophisticated, excellent like data scientists and software engineers.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.440
And so, and as I'm getting rustier and rustier, it's really, it's just not a good idea.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.660
And everything is so out of date.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.480
And, you know, obviously like technologies change and move on and it's easy to get out

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:26.700
of date.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.040
So yeah, now I spend a lot of time being a startup executive.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.640
Well, I mean, look, that's pretty awesome.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.800
Actually, I was just going to add in of like mixing all these technologies together, you know,

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.200
FastAPI is one of the new amazing things that sort of tied in with Ines, right?

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.040
Sebastian is part of your company.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.680
Yes.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:43.920
Yes.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.620
That's super cool.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:47.980
Talk Python.com.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.220
I mean, it's brought to you by Sentry.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.740
How would you like to remove a little stress from your life?

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.500
Do you worry that users might be having difficulties or are encountering errors in your app right

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:56.820
now?

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.760
Would you even know it until they send that support email?

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.940
How much better would it be to have the error and performance details immediately sent to

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:10.100
you, including the call stack and values of local variables and the active user recorded

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.020
in that report?

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.280
With Sentry, this is not only possible.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.140
It's simple.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.900
In fact, we use Sentry on all the Talk Python web properties.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:23.560
We've actually fixed a bug triggered by a user and had the upgrade ready to roll out as we

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.560
got their support email.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.240
That was a great email to write back.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.720
We saw your error and have already rolled out the fix.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.880
Imagine their surprise.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.120
Surprise and delight your users today.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.520
Create your Sentry account at talkpython.fm/sentry.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:41.780
And if you sign up with the code talkpython2021, it's good for two months of Sentry's team plan,

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:46.840
which will give you up to 20 times as many monthly events as well as other features.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.820
So just use that code talkpython2021 as your promo code when you sign up.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.560
And next up in my tab is Coiled.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.740
Matt, tell us about it.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.600
Maybe a better story just to talk about Dask and like the various stages in which we went

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:01.860
there.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.600
Let's make a better narrative.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.140
So we started with Dask Anaconda.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.000
Anaconda at the time was making most of its money as a consulting shop.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.180
And so we got clients that were either like government grants or were hedge funds or were

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:13.560
banks.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.820
And we had made some good software and they said, great, we want you to add features.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.920
We want you to help us use it.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.840
And so we were sort of like the standard consulting shop approach.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.720
I think it was a great way to start a business.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.180
You get a lot of high touch feedback.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.220
You get to move very easily.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.240
I think that was a good way.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.500
Eventually sort of Dask became big enough and Anaconda was doing other things at the time

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.280
that I was going to go off and make a new company.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.540
NVIDIA actually stepped in then and they said, great, if you want 5 or 10 people, we'll just

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.420
hire 5 or 10 people around you to work on Dask and Rapids.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:47.700
And so then we were a different model, which is making open source project within a giant

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.340
tech company.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.220
And that's like a different set of customers.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.840
We need to show how Dask sold GPUs.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.080
Right.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.480
That's very different than a consulting shop is to say, we've got a library that inspires

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.840
people to love CUDA cores.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.220
Yeah.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.420
But at the same time, like, you know, it's pretty easy to show that Dask generates, you

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.960
know, oh, $50 million of sales of GPUs.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.500
So great.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.820
Like here's $10 million for some other activity.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.280
And so that was just like a different kind of play.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.820
There's different incentives, but if you can use incentives to your advantage, you can get

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.320
things done.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.300
Eventually Dask, I think it got bigger.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.320
It didn't make sense to be within NVIDIA entirely.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.760
And so they went off and made a different company.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.300
That company is Coiled.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.420
We sort of started actually as we wanted to bootstrap, but like-

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.540
It was pretty close to this year, right?

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.800
Early this year?

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.420
Was that when it was?

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:32.640
Yeah.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.180
We were like coming up on our birthday in about a month.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.920
We'll be one year old in a little bit.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:42.520
And the main problem that Coiled solves is like setting up IT things around Dask.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.680
Distributed services, as I'm sure all of us can attest, are like annoying to set up,

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.620
especially in like more of an enterprise environment.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:56.560
And so Coil solves a lot of like IT infrastructure that makes Dask much easier to use for anybody.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:56.880
Yeah.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.140
And the cloud is fraught with, oh, let's just set up a bunch of clusters and we'll put this

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:01.940
in an S3 bucket.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.880
Oh, wait.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.600
It's hard to talk to the S3 bucket.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.960
So make it public and then forget that it's out there or some other horrible thing like

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.300
that, right?

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.660
It's good to have some help.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.520
Or just to set up Kubernetes is maybe a good example of that.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:12.780
Yeah.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.440
Like tending the Kubernetes cluster is like at least a half of an FTE job.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.080
If you can remove that, that's actually worth a fair bit of money.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.380
Yeah.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:19.560
Yeah.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.460
So your company is basically Dask as a platform.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.240
Yeah.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.080
Dask as a service.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.660
Yeah.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.280
Dask as a service.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:25.460
Yeah.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.540
The pitch, you can pip install Coiled and import Coiled and you can get Dask up and running

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.300
in about two minutes.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.400
We actually run our own enterprise product in the cloud for sort of a public offering.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.720
And it's, if you want to scale stuff, it's probably the easiest way to do it.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.360
Anyone here wants to spend a couple minutes, it'd be fun.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:41.880
It's always fun.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.240
Awesome.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.920
Yeah.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.500
Very, very cool.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.840
We went, we actually started as sort of the bootstrappy way and then like venture capital

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.860
was attractive enough that we ended up going that way instead.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.060
So we're like on the venture capital boat now for better or for worse.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:54.380
Yeah.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:54.640
Sure.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:54.880
All right.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.400
So we've got two VC votes, one non VC vote.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.440
I do want to say like, look, there are lots of.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:00.900
No, no, no.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.180
I mean like a sort of pad.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.300
Let's pass.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:03.500
Yeah.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.740
Like infrastructure businesses.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.620
That's just sure.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.640
That's very resource intensive.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.000
You're not going to prepay for all the cloud hosting that you're going to sell to the people.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.540
It makes sense.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:12.980
Yeah.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:18.060
My point is mostly that, hey, not every business has to start and subscribe to that sort of

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.060
startup playbook.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:19.220
Yeah.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:19.540
Instantly.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.540
That's what I'm saying.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.960
We went five or six years before doing this, right?

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.240
If you like count Anaconda, then NVIDIA as different models.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.860
I think we should not have started as VC funded.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.340
We would not have, we would not be nearly as successful.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.100
Yeah.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.860
Also, I'm sure you probably got a much better deal than you would have gotten otherwise as

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.100
like, oh, a seed company with his grand plans.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.900
Financing is like a super normal part of running a business.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.980
That makes tons of sense.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:46.720
Although I would say having done both, having run a small consulting company where we lived

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:52.160
out of our revenue and now having done this, it's hard to imagine doing this without having

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:52.880
done the other one.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.600
Like without having to run a business where you really didn't have to care, like paycheck

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.080
to paycheck cashflow to manage cashflow in that way.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.920
And now the numbers are bigger, but the principles are still the same.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.620
And not having learned that, like learning those same lessons with like a checking account

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.840
balance of this size would be, I mean, people do it all the time, but man, that would have

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.500
freaked me out.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.560
Yeah, for sure.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.320
It's still freaked me out.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.760
I can imagine.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.180
All right, William, last, but definitely at least, tell us about your SageMath as a platform

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.160
with CoCalc.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:23.360
Yeah.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.840
So I started CoCalc after teaching a lot of courses at various places.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.980
And basically one thing happened, which was that I was getting frustrated with grant funding

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.120
for development of SageMath through academia.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.400
Because what are you proving?

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.480
Like what theorems or new research is being generated by doing this, right?

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:42.840
Exactly.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:48.080
It's a lot, but it's hard to, you know, nail down exactly what research.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.360
Yeah.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.720
There's like an extra step.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.620
You build the software and people use the software.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:56.080
And then that inspires creating a conjecture or figuring out how to prove something.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:01.640
So there's so many steps along the way that the link can get lost.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.300
Yeah.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.820
Certainly lost on committees.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.280
So I got frustrated with that.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.600
And then also at the same time, SageMath is really big and complicated to install.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.400
And the distribution problem for where it is pretty difficult and getting it to work under

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.820
Windows and OS X and so on is really painful.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:25.960
So trying to kill both birds once, I started CoCalc where the idea was that it could generate

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.060
funding that could go towards Sage development.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.760
And it would make it a lot easier for people to use Sage without having to install it on their

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.120
computer.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:37.120
CoCalc has made it easier to use Sage and a lot of other open source software.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.940
It hasn't really provided any funding for Sage yet.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.300
There's a lot of years to go.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.440
So we'll see how things go.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:49.900
I launched the product in 2013, I think actually launched something and then started a company

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.260
in 2015.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:55.960
I spent a couple of years trying to work with the University of Washington where I was a

00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:02.600
tenured full professor to start up a company while being a professor and sort of spin it off

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.560
from the university.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.620
But that was surprisingly frustrating.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:14.780
And so I ended up getting I ended up finding an angel investor from outside the university and then working with him to start a company separately.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.720
I'm dealing with all the IP issues.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.320
In any case, everything got sorted out.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:25.620
I spent a couple of very painful years trying to be both a full time college professor and a CEO of a small tech company.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.100
And that was extremely stressful.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.640
And I can imagine because being a professor already is like multi pronged, right?

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.240
Yeah.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.920
You're a researcher and a grant writer.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:35.740
Oh, yeah.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.200
And also you're a teacher, right?

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.600
And your schedule gets very packed with very specific things that have to happen at certain times and you can't move.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:50.080
It's not like you could just say, oh, I think I'll teach this class to 100 people an hour later today because I'm busy with this denial of service attack or something.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.240
Yeah, exactly.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:24:02.320
So it just got there are a lot of actual moments precisely like that where I had these two conflicting responsibilities at once where the site was being attacked by some denial of service attack.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.620
And I was about to teach a class and I had to choose which am I going to deal with.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.600
Oh, my gosh.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.860
Yeah, it was very stressful.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.740
If I can jump in briefly.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.220
I'm actually curious if there are advantages.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.660
Like were there lessons that you learned as a professor that were really useful in running a company?

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:20.780
I learned the only thing that was really useful and it was very, very useful is understanding professors.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:26.260
So I have a pretty good understanding of the perspective of a professor as a potential user of CoCalc.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.520
Very good because I spent well over 15 years as a professor.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:42.460
So I can understand their perspective, but almost every intuition I have or had in academia in terms of how to do things is opposite of what I should do in business or startups.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.500
Just everything is just reversed for me, at least.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.560
So I decided what is my gut instinct for what I should do?

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.820
Question it and then possibly do the opposite.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.560
The rules are just so different.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:25:01.820
For example, in academia, you often apply for a grant and then find out six months or a year later and see how there's like really slow long-term process.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:06.820
Whereas in the company as an industry, you need to adapt quickly to what's trendy and what's important to users.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:15.340
And also even hiring is just such a different cycle in academia where you apply for a grant, then you get a position for a job, then you hire somebody.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.540
That's like two years from when you decide you want to hire somebody until you hire them.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.620
It's just a different scale.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.700
But in case, I love both situations, but I couldn't do both at once.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.860
Fortunately, my wife got a very good job as an academic and the company started making some money.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.580
So I got confident.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.880
And so I quit my, and this was really hard to do.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.880
I quit my tenured full professor job.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.840
Just quit it.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.940
I remember watching the video where you announced that because it was on YouTube and it was going around Twitter.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.820
And I'm like, oh, this is going to be interesting.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:43.540
Let me see this.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:50.560
Because that's a big deal as a tenure-tracked professor at a university like a University of Washington?

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.120
Washington University?

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:51.400
Yeah.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.360
Yeah, University of Washington.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.140
It was a good job and a very nice, the department's great for research.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:59.240
And I never thought I would quit a tenured job once I had one that I liked a lot.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.400
And I thought about it a lot, but just never thought it would happen.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.100
And then it kept not happening until it suddenly happened.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.940
It just felt like the right thing to do.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:12.200
So then I had a pretty stressful couple of years with other people working on the company.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.680
The infrastructure involving Kubernetes and other things melted down occasionally.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.260
I really, really wanted to get CoCalc in front of people so they would use it,

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.880
so that I would know what to develop, so that they would then use what I developed.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.620
And in order to do it, it was a delicate balancing act with getting it in front of people,

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.620
but also keeping it running.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.220
It got a lot more stable over the years.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:38.180
And now, like the one-sentence summary of what it is, is it's a web application that lets you

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:44.500
use open-source data science-related software collaboratively without having to install anything

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.000
yourself.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.620
And where the collaborative aspects go way beyond just Jupyter Notebooks with real-time collaboration

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:58.280
to real-time collaboration on terminals, all kinds of files that you're editing, video chat.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.680
And also, there's things like the file system gets snapshotted frequently.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.280
So when you're collaborating with somebody else, you need to know who did what or undo things.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.540
And so there's also a good attribution.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:13.100
So as people are editing a document, you can see who did what, a very high resolution.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.900
And it's mainly used by academics in teaching courses.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.480
Basically, it's a product that the main users are professors and their students.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.820
Right. And so I think it's really interesting, you were thinking you might not be leaving this

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:32.120
academic job, but your time there is really critical for helping you understand all the users, right?

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.720
Yeah, very, very critical.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.720
And of course, I learned a lot of mathematics.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:41.160
And having taught dozens and dozens of classes over the year, it gives you a certain perspective.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.160
And then the other question, so there's six angel investors in the company.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.620
There's no venture capital investment.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.040
And we've been profitable for about a year now.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.060
There are three people that work full-time on CoCalc.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:28:00.220
And our bank account is going up every day for the most part.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:00.940
That's awesome.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.180
If it's trending up and not down, good.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.100
Yeah. So we have no plans to raise further investment.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:13.560
And all of us really want a company that's relatively small, profitable, and not dependent on investors.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.420
Like, basically, we view our customers who are paying as many as our investors,

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.100
in that they're the ones that are driving our development direction.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.460
Yeah. That's awesome.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.400
Congratulations.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.120
And it's what we're all comfortable with.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:25.740
It's what we want.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.160
Just a different model.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:27.940
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.100
That's really great.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.880
I'll throw one thing out about myself, and then get back to questions.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.100
So for me, my full-time job also is the stuff I'm doing here with the podcast and the online courses.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.720
And I didn't get investment.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.380
I actually started on Kickstarter.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.220
So I reached out to all the podcast listeners and said,

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:45.980
I'm going to do this thing.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:46.760
Will you come help me?

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.360
The Kickstarter funded within 12 hours, and it was off to the races.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.140
It was fantastic.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.080
So there's all these different paths, right?

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.960
So I think maybe a good place to move over to talk about next is

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.900
we all see where you've been.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.320
And that's really the slight variations, but also the commonalities of what you built,

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:03.860
which is awesome.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.100
But William was just talking about it.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.720
You've got this great job.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.520
Maybe you don't have a great job, but you like paying the rent and having some kind of job.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:19.300
But how did you decide it was time to quit, go all in on this?

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.220
Or did you, like me, I started the podcast while I had a job,

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.560
but then quit and then started the course side of things.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.880
What was the path and how did you decide it was time?

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.660
Actually, it's funny that we were just talking about all academia and grant proposals,

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.340
because for my co-founder, that was he.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.800
He was at a point where he had to write grant proposals and as a postdoc.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.960
And he was like, nah, I'm out of here.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.800
That's not what I want to do.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.380
And so that was for him the point.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.800
And yeah, for me, it happened.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.000
Like, sure, I was also in a privileged position that I was I live in typically live in Berlin,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.500
Germany.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.320
It's a nice city with a good standard of living, while also low cost of living.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.460
So I was able to say, hey, I'll try this.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.540
Worst case, I go back to being a freelancer as I was before.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.680
I'll always find someone to pay me enough to live.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.680
So why not?

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.640
You know, just do it.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.060
It was a good time to do that, but it was no major.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.480
And I was kind of sick of what I was doing before.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.060
So it just fit in and felt right.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.340
And I was like, OK, I'm privileged that I can do that.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.420
Yeah, fantastic.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.940

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.120
William, you were just talking about it.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.620
I started working with the commercialization office at the university,

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.980
like meeting with them every week and reading the rules of the university and realizing...

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.220
They're going to help me do this.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:31.780
Wait a minute.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:32.340
They're not helping me.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.660
Yeah, there's a lot of legal and intellectual property issues involved with

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:41.060
working at an employer while working on something that you want to be a business.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.440
Yes, it's very tricky.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:48.160
Basically, a lot of jeopardy with being an employee of the university at any amount above like 5%

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.420
in terms of them owning what I do.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.780
So it got complicated that way.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.040
And that was another motivation for me.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.660
It was just that I couldn't find a way to both work at the university and,

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.820
for example, for investors to have any confidence that I owned what I was actually doing.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.360
Oh, yeah.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.160
That's interesting to think of it from the investor angle as well.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.800
Universities, for people who don't know, they take a good chunk of what is created there.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.540
They take a good percentage of grants that they get and stuff.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.320
So, yeah, it could be interesting and tricky.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.240
Especially when it's commercially valuable.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:22.700
So they don't care so much about just a completely non-commercial open source project.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.220
But they can be pretty...

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.560
Well, they want a cut of businesses.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.820
Yeah, makes sense.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.760
I talked to another faculty member at the University of Washington.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.000
He had written some software in the company.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.060
The university wanted a huge license fee for him to be able to use it.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.080
Like several dollars per user.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.240
50% of all the money the company made.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.400
He said it was a horrible experience.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.100
So he got warned away from trying to...

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.040
It was nerve-wracking trying to balance that.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.420
So it's hard to have a job at a company at the same time as you're trying to start another company.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.220
It was the same for me.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.700
I work for a company that did online developer training.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.020
There's no way I could create another online developer company.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.040
While I was like, it was right in my contract.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:00.880
Don't do that.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.420
That will be ours if you try that sort of thing.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.900
I think you could only really have one job.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.080
Or that's something we often say.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.540
It's like, yeah, there are lots of companies we could start and businesses we could start.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.800
But you could only really run one company.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.400
And you have to have a clear vision and do the thing.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.280
Like if you try to run like five different companies at the same time, that usually doesn't end well.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:19.600
Yeah.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.700
Or then you're running like five half-ass companies.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.060
I think the same is actually even true.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.980
Like it's a pretty popular model.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.060
Or I think it's like a...

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.200
I said this is having run a consultancy that tried to do this.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.200
It's a little bit of a pipe dream that you can take consulting income, which is easier to get.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.840
Especially for technology, the margins can be pretty high.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.160
Right.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:41.260
In the short term, it's let me do this thing for two weeks so we can eat and that'll keep us going.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.220
But yeah, it's...

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:42.300
Yeah.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.440
And then we'll use it to make a product.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.120
Like we'll use our consulting work to somehow make a product out of it.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.140
That's what we...

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:47.840
I mean, kind of...

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.580
That's not what we did.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.040
We call it...

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.120
We raised the client round.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.520
So we just did consulting to get some cash in and then build the product.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:53.880
But yeah.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.360
Yeah, yeah.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:54.720
Exactly.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.460
Like it can be one and then the other.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:56.820
Yeah.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.000
People often don't understand that.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.860
And they think that like you can just take on consulting gigs that in aggregate will like become a software

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.200
product.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.200
I mean, there are definitely examples of people who do it.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.140
There's always an exception.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.560
Like I know people have done that successfully.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.160
But at least in my experience, that was remarkably hard.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:10.880
Like it was...

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.900
We reached the point where we have to just say, we're going to set the consulting work aside

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:17.560
and then we're just going to go focus on making this a product so that we can do the things

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.600
that you do when you do a product.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.320
When you actually build a product and you don't necessarily get caught up into what's the next

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.260
feature that we need to do?

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.740
Like how can I split my time?

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:25.480
Like split the focus.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.580
Like you were just saying, it's so easy to get that split focus between a bunch of different clients

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.620
and this consulting business.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:35.600
And then also trying to figure out how to go like, I think in a more like long-term product

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.180
development way.

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.280
It's really hard to do two things.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.460
For me, at least it's super hard to do two things at once.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.500
And I'm really good at doing one thing and really, really bad at doing two things.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.660
Matthew, how about you?

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.740
How did you decide that it was time?

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.220
Oh, we just had like intense user pressure to do this.

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:55.320
Like when we made Coil, there were a bunch of banks and hedge funds who were happy to be

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.780
customers day one.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:03.900
It sounds like it's great for Matt because he just had these people lined up, but you did

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:07.120
the work for years to get into that position, right?

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.340
You had built up Dask.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.980
You had built up those connections.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.620
And so when it was time-

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.640
And many others, to be clear.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.140
Like there's a large set of people-

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.520
Only because only you are on the show.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.980
Speaking to you as a whole of your community-

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.220
It's like the royal, I guess.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:19.600
Yeah.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:19.980
Yes.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.320
Like intense user pressure at every stage, right?

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.940
Like we just grew bigger than Anaconda because of the time.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.700
So we went to NVIDIA.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.080
We grew bigger than NVIDIA because of the sports.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:27.920
We made Coil.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.900
Yeah.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.760
And so we probably did it late.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.820
Maybe it's like the-

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:32.760
We're probably the counter example.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.540
Like we probably could have started this a couple of years ago and been just fine.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.800
So maybe we should have.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.500
Like I could have been sitting here with my millions of billions of dollars.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.920
Wouldn't it be great if somebody could come to us and say, go back in time five years

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.100
ago.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.320
Here's the best choice you could make.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:46.540
Yeah.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.560
You could have bought a Bitcoin or something.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.480
Two Bitcoins.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.180
I didn't even know.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:54.980
I mean, generally, like making a company is a risky thing and you need to be somewhat

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.640
risk tolerant.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.080
I was not very risk tolerant.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.760
I'm actually a pretty risk averse kind of guy.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:58.920
Yeah.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.280
And me as well.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.620
I'm exactly with you.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:06.400
And it was really super scary for me because like I described, I had to quit my job.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.280
I couldn't try it.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.180
I had to quit and then try it.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.840
And I had just gotten a new job that was really well paid.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.940
Two daughters who were in college got to pay their tuition, not a ton saved up.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.800
Mortgage.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.660
I mean, it was not like I was just 21 and living in Thailand with low expenses, right?

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.420
It was consequences of failure.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:27.260
But the more I thought about it, the thing that helped me was I thought really hard.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.720
I said, okay, well, what's going to happen if I fail?

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.920
I'm probably going to have to go find another job.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.980
Maybe it's not exactly the technology I want.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.420
It's not exactly the commute that I want.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.520
But the worst case scenario is that I get a job that's a lot like what I'm doing now.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.280
So to me, it was like, well, if what I'm doing now looks like failure, maybe I could do better.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.840
If I could just fall back into this, not failure per se, but like the landing zone looks like what I'm doing.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.900
Why don't I reach a little higher and see if I can go do something else?

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.060
You know, that was my thing.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.500
But that sounds more like calculated risk taking.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:55.780
Yes.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.300
Fine.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:00.360
I mean, it's not like you moved your whole family across the world to become a rapper or something.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:00.920
Yes, exactly.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.760
And then you fail.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.900
I did that when I was younger.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:03.860
You kids are like, what the fuck?

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.020
It's a great point.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:06.220
Yeah.

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.720
It was very calculated.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:16.840
I definitely took a significant risk because I had a math professor job tenured at a university that my wife has a very good tenure track job at.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.840
So we solved the two people at the same university problem and all of that.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.120
That is very hard to solve.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.320
So to recreate that is not easy.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:29.480
And then when you quit a math research job for a couple of years and then try to go back, that's really, really hard as well.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.120
Yeah.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:35.800
Extremely hard to, because you're competing with a bunch of young people who are doing all the trendy stuff to try to get a job again.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.120
And at the same university, that would be really, really unlikely.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.600
So it was pretty risky.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:46.680
So I didn't quit until I was maybe overly confident that we were going to succeed as a company.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.960
Maybe I was less confident than you, Matt.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.340
Or maybe I should have been less confident than I was.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:54.300
But so far, it's gone really well.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:54.540
Yeah.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:54.980
Fantastic.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.600
What did you all do to prepare?

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.460
Did you make sure you had a certain amount of savings?

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.060
Did you try to build up connections?

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.520
What did you all do?

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.780
I already had those things.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.980
I think what I did is I talked to a lot of people.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:10.940
I think I recommend, I think making a company is a lot of very quickly becoming an expert.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.880
It's something you know nothing about.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.700
And making a really ill-informed decision.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.040
And a lot of that has to do with just talking to people.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.980
And so you need to find a lawyer.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:18.440
Great.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.220
You talk to the five people who know lawyers.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.020
Get a few introductions.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:24.600
After you talk to three or four lawyers, you kind of know how that conversation goes.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.940
You're now able to choose one.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.440
You choose one.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:26.900
You move on.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:32.680
So I think just having a bunch of phone conversations with, you know, not 10 people, but 50 people.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.620
And also the right people.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:38.640
Like I talked to the wrong lawyers at the University of Washington, and it was very unhelpful.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.320
Then I talked to the right lawyers at actual law firms, and it was incredibly helpful.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:42.840
Yeah.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.200
Interesting.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.200
It makes a huge difference.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.560
Ultimately, running a company, you have to make lots of decisions, and most of the decisions have to be right.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.560
And you have to keep making the right decision in a row.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.680
Like that's kind of, there's very little magic about it.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.680
If you're wrong, that's fine.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.040
Then you have to try again.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.360
Well, ideally, you shouldn't be too wrong.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.340
If you're too wrong, then that's not good.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:38:59.740
Yeah.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:00.720
Or at least wrong quickly.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.040
Right?

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.080
Yeah.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.040
Yeah.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:10.300
But I think that's also why, I don't know, if you're doing, if you're really trying it out and doing something real, I think that can really help.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.720
But that's why doing a real business where, I don't know, you want to be profitable.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.200
If you start doing that first, that helps because you see the money coming in.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:25.920
Otherwise, it's often very easy to spend a very long time doing the wrong thing because you have the cash to do so, and then you can crash and burn.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.320
You know, if there's real demand there and a real thing there, that helps because you see.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.440
But also, you actually can make wrong decisions.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.000
You just can't make them for very long.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.480
You need to be, like, you're going to make wrong decisions.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:42.800
I think you just can't, like, you need to also accept that you're wrong and you need to not dig in too much.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.120
But I think a lot of it isn't about making the exact right choice.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.680
It's just about adjusting and adapting on a day-by-day basis.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:56.020
And also, make sure that the potential downside, if you make the wrong decision, isn't fatal.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:01.100
Like with climbing a mountain, you can make some wrong mistakes, but make sure you have an ice axe to stop your slide.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.620
You can sort of just not do much.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.320
Exactly.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:03.740
Yeah.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.820
Yeah, I guess that's with that analogy.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:12.700
It's like if you're building a rocket to go up that mountain, that's much more risky because then your rocket has to work.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.400
And your rocket's going to be really expensive to build.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.900
If that works, amazing.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.820
You've made it up the mountain in, like, a few minutes.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.040
But if it fails, that's it.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.100
Whereas if you walk up at least a bit, that's pretty good.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.380
I like what you said a second ago.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:30.640
I think it's actually, especially for people with technical backgrounds, I think it's really important to hear that there's,

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:35.580
that the only way that you know whether or not your business is succeeding or not is if it's making money.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:45.060
It sounds like a silly thing to say out loud, but I think for a lot of technologists, it's, there's just no, you can't, it's easy to convince yourself that there's a lot of other ways that your business can be successful.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:49.300
And there's a lot of ways that a project can be successful because you build a great community.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.480
Maybe your open source project has a lot of users.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.600
It's solving a problem that you care a lot about.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.600
Like, all of those are totally valid things to make a project successful.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.840
But if you're starting a business, the only way that it is successful is if it makes money.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:08.920
I think that's, like, you kind of have to accept it and know whether or not that's something that motivates you and whether that's something that, like, if you want to keep score for your project in that way.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.840
So, I, that's exactly how we see it.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.940
I mean, you said it kind of in passing, but it's like, yeah.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:14.740
Yeah.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.780
I think I've said before, like, profit is the best KPI.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.440
That's what you should, you know, look at, ideally, if you can.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:35.140
But it's a huge difference from academia where the success of a grant proposal is that you wrote a paper that got published in a good journal that people cite, which is not, it doesn't generate, it's just such a different metric, basically.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:35.540
Yeah.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.080
Yeah, it really is.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:41.360
And it's easy to think, this thing that I love, I don't need to make money on it.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:49.480
But at the same time, if you can manage to do it, all of a sudden, not two hours a week where you're tired, you can spend a little extra time on it.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.680
Like, you could put all of your time and energy into it.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:42:00.140
And another thing that I think is interesting to think about is if you're able to make something happen, create some project, create something that you're working on on the side.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:13.280
If you can make that somewhat successful with two or four hours a week, if you manage to spend 40 to 60 hours a week on it, all of a sudden, well, it's a whole lot easier to get some traction than if you're just scraping away when you're tired at the end of the day.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:24.960
Yeah, but I think especially if you're starting out as a side project, like, you know, a side business, a side business fundamentally is not a business if it, you know, at least as a side business, if it doesn't make money, it's an expensive hobby, if it's something you do on the side.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:30.840
So I think if that's the approach you take, where you say, hey, I want to start something on the side, and then maybe turn it into something bigger.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.940
I do think a good plan is to make money.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:33.960
Yeah, I totally agree.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:44.900
Yeah, you when you were on the show before, Ines, you wanted to, or maybe it was just in your talk, but you said, it's okay to charge money for a thing that you put a lot of energy into to have people support your company, right?

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.840
I mean, that was part of your talk way back.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.880
Also, in general, companies want to spend money.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:52.960
It's this myth of companies don't necessarily use open source, in my opinion, because only because it's free.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.780
It's the whole spirit of open source.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.440
It's available.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.120
It's good.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.740
It's also, you download it.

00:42:58.740 --> 00:42:59.100
It runs.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.420
You can program with it.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.340
You can work with it.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.020
You own it.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.320
And you own the result.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.080
That's what people like about open source, not just the fact that it's free.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.620
I think almost in spite of the fact that it's free, companies use it.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.440
Because so often they're like, who do we pay so that we can yell at them and get it fixed when it's not what I want, right?

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.120
Yeah, exactly.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:15.420
Yeah.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:15.940
Yeah.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:20.440
So that's something we've also used to motivate the way we are building our stack.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:26.340
And even if it's not free in that sense, and it's commercial, it can still have the same spirit of open source.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.420
And we've found that this is very popular with developers.

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.800
And people really like our tools for those reasons.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:36.280
Maybe that's a good segue over to this sort of mix of open source and business models.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.460
There are a lot of open source projects that get so much energy.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:47.440
And it boggles my mind that the person who's working on that project, it's not just entirely successful for them.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:54.020
I'm thinking of requests or Django or Flask or these things where it really is being used by so many people.

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:58.100
Surely there's enough support for the person who's writing it to just keep writing it.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:06.560
All of you are examples of how can I create something that I'm selling as a product that also supports some open source thing that just makes it better for everyone,

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.540
even if it was just the open source thing that they cared about.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:13.860
What are your thoughts on having some paid thing that's not necessarily supported by open source,

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.960
but it has a kernel of open source around it or in it?

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:22.200
With CoCalc, the actual software of CoCalc, maybe 50% open source.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.120
Like our actual web application, a lot of the backend is closed source.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:30.320
We have an open source version that you can install in a Docker image that's entirely open source.

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:35.640
But the key thing that's really open source about CoCalc is all the software that you use when you're running,

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.460
when you're inside of CoCalc itself is open source.

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:45.760
So you have access to Julia and Octave and R and Python and Jupyter Notebooks and SageMath and all this other stuff.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:52.120
So it's really, we have a product that benefits a lot of open source math software and open source data science software does well.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.840
And so our interests are very aligned.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.420
So the product benefits from open source doing well.

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.700
Unlike, say, Mathematica, which kind of, it's the opposite.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.600
It doesn't benefit if open source does well.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:03.960
Yeah.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:08.880
But we, on the other hand, I tried for a long time to make CoCalc entirely open source, just top to bottom.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.880
And it really made investors nervous.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:18.060
And it made employees nervous who are going to spend 60 hours a week working on writing the software.

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:24.180
They're worried that some other company could just take exactly 100% of software without permission or whatever

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:30.040
and make a site that offers the same thing and charges exactly half as much or something like that.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:36.060
I don't know there necessarily needs to be an expectation like, because you run a platform, the entire thing needs to be given away, right?

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:36.360
Yeah.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:42.580
We run a platform that is not entirely open source, but it makes it easier for college professors to use open source in teaching their classes.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.400
So it benefits open source overall.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:44.800
Yeah.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.400
And Matt, you're sort of in a similar situation with a platform story.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:48.900
Sure.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:55.080
I think maybe like all of us are in a shared situation of we have a free thing that's like the main value.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.580
We need to like find some like peripheral thing to sell around it.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.240
Maybe it's consulting services, maybe it's support, maybe it's a dev tool, maybe it's like an IT solution.

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:07.140
And we're selling to part of a company that's slightly different from our user base.

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.380
And that requires some finesse.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.640
And we're all navigating that space and exploring that space and seeing what works and doesn't work.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.360
There's lots of ways to make that work.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.680
Yeah. So how did you decide what you're going to sell?

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.300
People ask, this is what I got for free.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:19.820
I need more.

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:20.720
Yeah.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:21.700
Complaints that everyone has.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.960
It's really hard to deploy this stuff.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.180
That's like the IT buyer rather than data science buyer.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.900
Like they're very used to spending money.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.400
It made sense to make something proprietary to sell to them.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.180
That is like that fit.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.320
Also, like I think lots of companies have done this before.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:33.640
Right.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.840
This is like the Databricks play.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.300
This is kind of what Cloudera does.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.380
This is a very common playbook.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.520
There are other great common playbooks like dev tools, like other systems.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.400
So lots of challenges to this too.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:44.680
Right.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:48.520
Like I happen to have like a large amount of control over the free thing, Dask.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:53.140
I'm very tempted to do things to the free thing that like benefit the company.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.340
And so there's definitely like things that you need to watch out for in this space.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.140
It's not all, I think we're all going to say it's all great.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.860
But I guess this can also be positive.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:01.220
Oh, sorry.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.360
This can also be positive if it's aligned.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.840
For example, that's what's the case.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.460
In our case, our tool Prodigy also uses Spacey.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:12.200
So lots of Spacey users use Prodigy to create training data for their models.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:17.220
So we've actually become very, very active users of our own open source software ourselves.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.740
And we make lots of improvements that do benefit our product and vice versa.

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.720
And everyone benefits from that.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.280
And we're in exactly the same situation.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.060
But eventually like competition arises.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.200
And then like I can make this change in Dask, which definitely benefits my product,

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.200
does not benefit my competitor's product.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.080
Right.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:36.400
I feel like it's a little bit like open source software is kind of like being in the ocean,

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.060
like in a rowboat.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.680
And there's a really strong wind, which is business.

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.940
There's like, and if you can capture that wind, you can go a lot faster.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.340
But the wind isn't going in quite the same direction that you want to go in.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.000
As you need to build like a sail, you need to learn how to attack.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.200
You need to like learn how to like, to harness that wind to go in the direction you want to go

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.320
way faster than you could on your own.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:00.620
But there's actually like building, like sailing stuff is actually really hard.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.960
And that requires a lot of nuance and a lot of like thought.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.800
And we're all kind of building up our own sails and our own rudders.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.880
Yeah, that's a cool analogy.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.280
Jonathan, how about you?

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:12.500
So we are in an interesting spot where our whole stack is based on top of open source Python.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.260
And I think we benefit hugely from that.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:20.640
I think the where we actually had an interesting way that kind of was important to us as we were

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.880
giving back to the open source community.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:27.180
We did a lot of research that was publicly funded research that was focused on how do we automate

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.340
different aspects of machine learning?

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:32.960
And then in some cases, like how do we discover some of the patterns, like what are approaches

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:37.020
or strategies that discover some of the patterns of the way that information gets disseminated

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:37.660
across the internet?

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:42.460
And so both in a research capacity, so we've actually published research about some of these

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:46.240
different projects that we worked on, like academic research, which is a cool thing for a company

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.420
at our stage to be able to do, to have the opportunity to do.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:52.400
And then we published some open source libraries that some of which we use and some of which like

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.860
we've actually abandoned, like they weren't like we haven't abandoned the libraries, but we've

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:57.720
abandoned them as features inside of our product.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.560
So they're no longer kind of like a key component of what we do, but something that was important to us

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.320
at one point, like helped us explore a really important idea and then do have some adoption

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:06.920
in the community.

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:12.780
And in fact, there's a few that I think are embedded in other companies' platforms, which

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:13.320
is kind of cool.

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:17.560
There's a company in Austin called Data.World, which is a data catalog company, also built on top

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:18.600
of like open source roots.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.960
And I think some of their data visualization libraries and then some of their like data

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.080
inference libraries are built on top of some of our open source projects because we were more

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:26.900
closely aligned with us.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:30.660
So it's definitely still a part of our DNA, a part of our culture, our technology and engineering

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:31.020
culture.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:36.280
Although we're in a slightly different position that the thing that we sell is like a, we

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.880
have, it's like an enterprise intelligence communications product.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:44.880
It's a little more like a traditional company that just uses open source instead of we're the

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.080
company behind this project plus or something.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:47.680
Oh, totally.

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:51.700
I think a lot of like, you are talking about users who are very technical, you know, like

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:55.880
professors kind of teaching technology or like IT or developer users.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:03.300
Our users usually have a BA in communications with a minor in poli sci and find like spreadsheets

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:06.120
to be overwhelming because it's like, it's the data, you know what I mean?

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:10.220
And like, and so in a way, like it's helped us be focused on being really empathetic and

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:14.780
how we present like analytics and output, but they're really far away from like a traditional

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.320
technology.

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:15.700
Yeah.

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.000
Yeah.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:16.560
Very interesting.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.380
All right.

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.480
We're getting near the end of our time together.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:24.380
So let's maybe close this out just with two quick final wrap up and some questions that

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.600
the audience threw out there as well.

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.560
You all have made it.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.300
I would say like you're all building successful stuff.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.900
You're making progress.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.140
Who knows what the future holds, right?

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:37.960
But it looks like you're doing great stuff and you've made that transition to where you

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:38.320
want to be.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:42.600
But a bunch of people out there listening are dreaming of doing something, but that maybe

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.560
they're not really sure where to start or what to work on.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.840
What advice would you have for people who are thinking of trying to create their own data

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.520
science related type of startup?

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.100
And what areas do you see that they might focus on?

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:58.000
I hate giving advice because it's so that, but in terms of areas, I want to, I do want to

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:58.640
comment on the areas.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.120
The one thing I see a lot in our field is we only just at the very beginning of like machine

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:07.860
learning ops and for the lack of a better word, I don't know, operational stuff, like

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:12.840
how to, you know, really take like your project from a prototype to production and make that

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.460
smooth.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:13.680
Yeah.

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.400
Productizing your actual exploration.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:16.780
Yeah.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:17.080
Yeah.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.560
Or just, you have like some researchers hacking around in notebooks and then you also want

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.520
to ship something into production and there's all this, you have your data, you have that,

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:25.900
you have that.

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:30.420
So there's, that's very, we're in very early stages here, but I do think there's a lot of

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:36.520
room for innovation here and also innovation that's actually, you know, useful to the developer

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.180
and that really integrates into the existing workflows.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:44.140
Because I think one problem we do have with a lot of companies that went for the enterprise

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:49.820
first type of thing is that a platform like that only works if you own the whole workflow

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.700
end to end and you want to be the one platform everyone uses.

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:57.520
Many people are trying that at the moment and some companies may succeed, some won't, but

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.480
that's very unattractive to a lot of real world scenarios.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:04.380
Because if you give someone the choice of like all or nothing, people have to be like,

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:07.180
if I don't want all, I guess I have to go for nothing.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.000
I don't want this thing to own everything.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.340
I just want a tool that helps me do stuff.

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.840
I think there's a lot of low hanging fruit that's very profitable.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:14.680
Yeah.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.280
Very interesting.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.200
Yeah.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:16.480
Yeah.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.660
You're so right.

00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:23.880
I think where we've spent the most of our time and just technical churn is in that prototyping

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:28.080
stage where somebody got it to run in a notebook or somebody has a little script that they run

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.080
from the command line.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:34.020
And then the, how to go from that to, oh yeah, hold on.

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.580
I'm going to deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.140
We're going to run it like in parallel to it on a thousand machines.

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:41.720
And there's a lot of really great tools for whatever that is.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:45.020
And we're going to make sure it's running all the time on the weekend.

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:45.660
Yeah, exactly.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.120
Totally.

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.540
Like infrastructure is a service until the cows come home.

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.900
But then there's that middle ground where it's like, well, what we really want to do

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.920
is we want to put this into a simple pipeline.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.960
So it runs every day.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.400
We want to put it in front of a few users.

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.840
Like we actually just want to run it on like real world data that updates every 24 hours.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:04.460
That like kind of toy pipeline stuff, like what you might call like an alpha if you were

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:08.860
making application software or something, or what are that pre-alpha or A-B testing?

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:12.140
Like all of that, that workflow, like I think right kind of where you're talking about it

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:12.280
is.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.260
It's like, I, that it doesn't seem to exist.

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:20.700
And we actually like have retooled our infrastructure to focus on that use case because it's so common

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:22.940
for us to introduce new analytics to our customers.

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.180
And like the presentation layer is relatively straightforward.

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:30.480
And so we actually are sunsetting some pretty heavy infrastructure that we use to operate

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.960
because it just doesn't, it was such a pain.

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.120
Like it's such a pain to work with.

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:38.940
And in fact, we're not always working on massive data sets all of the time.

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:44.080
A lot of times it's like, we do a pretty good job filtering down to smaller, like artisanal

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:47.740
small batch data and then running like single machine computation.

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:52.120
And it's a lot of like the problems, the machine learning problems are simpler once if we think

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:55.420
about it in the right way, but there's not a lot of good tools for that kind of experimentation

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:55.960
and prototyping.

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:56.240
Yeah.

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:56.620
Yeah.

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.580
Also that that's where the trend is going.

00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:01.160
This whole idea of big data, we need billions of records.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:01.700
Yeah, maybe.

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:06.980
But nowadays we see that, oh, with transfer learning, we can actually train pretty good stuff on a

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:08.540
pretty small scale and it works.

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.220
Hey, now, hey, now, you're cutting edge by market.

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:10.900
Cutting edge by market.

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.760
Can I stop talking about that, folks?

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:18.880
Yeah, no, no, that's super great too.

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:19.860
But I agree with you.

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:23.220
It's not even like necessarily just the training, which I agree with that completely.

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:27.740
And then even that, once you have a model that's trained, then you're going to be operating

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:33.600
on kind of production data to like make predictions or augment the data or season it or produce batch

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:34.560
analytics or whatever you're doing.

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:39.260
That usually happens on a relatively small amount of data, like relatively speaking to like what

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:40.180
we might think was training data.

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:44.260
And so many use cases are not all of them, but a lot of use cases, I think, in a company's

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:47.260
tool, both the everyday ones are in fact just a little bit more straightforward.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.320
Yeah, interesting.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.100
Cool.

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:54.180
William, Matt, you guys got some ideas on where people might find some open space?

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.560
Well, one thing is there's a big difference between a really cool idea for something to

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:02.060
build or a product and something you can actually make a business around and sell.

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:06.700
So it's good to think hard about how do you take, you know, the 20 different things you

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:12.080
might do that all seem really neat and decide which one is most likely to be something that

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.520
you could actually sell to people.

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.360
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.460
This thing looks cool, but what will they actually pay for it, right?

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:17.540
Yeah.

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:19.680
Without that, you can't put your time to it.

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:24.280
CoCalc is a really, it's basically just this platform where we can basically do almost anything

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.460
collaboratively with several people using it through a web browser.

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:31.280
And so there's a million ideas for things we can add to it.

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.720
And every day we have to stop and say, okay, what thing are we going to actually do?

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:39.840
And then we have this kind of iterative process where we look at what people are asking for,

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.720
what people who will pay us are asking for, and then what the results should be of the

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:45.360
platform overall.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:50.280
So we've thought more about just how to systematically build good stuff into CoCalc to make it more

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.300
valuable to our users.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:55.320
But we just get a rate on that rather than having some other more grand time.

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.100
Oh, we just have a strategy.

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:56.660
Yeah.

00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:57.220
Yeah.

00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:03.020
We just have a strategy for improving the product that customers appreciate, basically.

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:03.480
Yeah.

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.240
Fantastic.

00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:05.440
Matt, how about you?

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.220
I'll give you the final word on this one.

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.040
Yeah, great.

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:12.000
I'll give me like a general thought on starting companies and then maybe like a civic, but

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.220
general thing, like no one knows what they're talking about.

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:17.300
I am definitely not qualified to answer the question of like how to build a company.

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:22.440
I think everyone on this call, except for maybe Jonathan, like this is our first time in

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.100
this process.

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:23.900
If I have that right.

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.300
No one knows what they're doing.

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.600
So don't trust us.

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.580
Also, like we're the mildly successful people.

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.500
Most people fail.

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.060
Given that, I'll now make my prediction.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.800
So I just want, can I kind of just interject?

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:39.720
I do think, I mean, I do, I get your point of like, oh, nobody knows what they're doing.

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.520
But like, you know, some people do know what they're doing.

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:45.080
You know, there's some stuff you, you know, you do and you do well.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.480
And that's good.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.880
And I think that that is something that we should, you know, celebrate and honor that

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:53.040
like, I do think a lot of things where, you know, I know what I'm doing and there are other

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.760
things where I'm like, well, I don't know.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:57:02.020
But like, I mean, I have a lot of broken noses from trying to run through walls for four or

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.140
five years, maybe the company work.

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:05.300
And like, I've earned this broken nose.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:07.580
Yeah.

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:09.400
I really agree with that.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:13.060
Like, cause you know, you've made a whole bunch of really hard decisions that you spent months

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.000
maybe thinking about over the last five years.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.660
Like we all have and we're still alive or our companies are.

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:19.720
So that's something.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:20.100
Right.

00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:23.980
I guess maybe my point is I now know how to make the company that I made or I'm like in

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:28.320
the process of making, but like, I'm not sure how transferable my expertise is to someone

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:28.620
else.

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:32.060
Like we all like wandered through the forest and we like hit a bunch of trees.

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:32.560
We're like, oh, great.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.360
We found a clearing.

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.380
But if someone else is in a forest, we don't necessarily know how to get to another clearing

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:36.640
again.

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:41.940
That being said, and I'll give my like, my advice given that I like what Inez said about like,

00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.700
they're always now like, there's all in one platforms.

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:45.880
I think those are kind of going away.

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:49.420
Now I've seen a lot of companies that are providing little specialized services.

00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:54.120
I think there's actually a great need in like integrating those services together and integrating

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:54.940
those products together.

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.640
I think that there's a great need.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.480
And that's also like a great, that's an easy thing to get into.

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:03.480
If you would just like start a consultancy shop and start integrating products in like

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.680
some domain, maybe you're in finance.

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.560
Maybe you're in something else.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.880
Maybe you're in a scalable NLP.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:12.240
You can use, you know, explosion and coiled at the same time.

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.940
Like there's no company that's going to help you do that thing together.

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:20.300
So I think that's maybe a place where I think people can start is in cobbling together all

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:21.780
of these new sort of product companies.

00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:21.960
Yeah.

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:24.580
And once you get into one of these verticals, you're like, you know what, there's this thing

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:25.900
that everyone seems to struggle with.

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:29.840
And now I'm in a position to really know the people and solve the problem.

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.100
Yeah.

00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:33.640
And have people who've already paid me for it before, which I think is also good because

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:34.640
there's this startup wisdom.

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:38.540
You have to schedule calls and talk to potential customers, but you never know what they're going

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:39.000
to tell you.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.880
You can talk to someone's like, Hey, could you imagine buying this for me?

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.240
And people would be like, yeah, sure.

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.880
And it doesn't mean anything.

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:45.700
So yeah.

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.120
But I would start, I would start with consulting.

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:52.360
I would start with integrating existing products and then find that pain point that you hear 20 times.

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.140
And then that's the problem.

00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:53.380
Yeah.

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:56.760
Let me close out the question from the audience here that I think is relevant.

00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:03.060
Maggie Kaman says a question, how intimidating were the business skill side of things for

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:03.500
all of you?

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:09.120
We all told our stories that we more or less started in some technical aspect and to varying

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:13.360
degrees worked out payroll taxes, investment, VC, all these things.

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.200
But what are your thoughts, Joe?

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.560
It depends on where you're based.

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.940
Different countries have different, you know, situations.

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:21.940
I do feel like, you know, I did run, I was a freelancer before, which helped me a bit.

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:26.700
I do take pride in, you know, being able to run my company and direct my company and do all

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:28.560
these things and be on top of things.

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:33.060
And I do think if you have that sort of mentality, you know, yeah, there's bureaucracy involved.

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.200
That's just how it is.

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:37.380
But it also feels good to be able to really be on top of what you're doing.

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:37.600
Yeah.

00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.100
I felt entirely unprepared.

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:43.400
But I think Ines York's point there that you start with freelancing because you have to do a

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:46.480
lot more of the tax payroll side just for yourself.

00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:47.100
And then it grows.

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.240
Jonathan, did I interrupt you?

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:48.740
Not at all.

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:53.400
Well, I was going to make a similar point that like the consequences for mistakes, as

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:57.800
those consequences get more severe, you'll have more opportunity to pay your way out of

00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.960
the liability for it.

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.900
As you have to start to deal with like payroll from people in like different US states or maybe

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.340
even different countries and managing the tax implications and registering your business

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:08.040
and like all of that type of stuff.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.660
Or frankly, like even knowing how much tax you have to pay relative to how you operate

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.340
your business, like those things are pretty complex.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.180
And you get over a number of certain employees.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:19.580
And then there's a whole new set of laws that apply to your business that didn't before for

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:23.320
protecting different classes of workers and stuff like that, which gets really complicated.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.480
But now there are services that you can sign up for that manage almost like the entirety

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.280
of that kind of like people operation.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.460
So for a bigger business, the consequences are severe, but you can pay your way out of it.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:37.840
And when you're small, like it's a bummer if you get a tax bill one quarter, that's

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.000
I had some five figure of stakes when I was a freelancer.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.340
You always have at least an accountant.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:48.980
Like I do want to, I'm not sitting here claiming that I do like literal payroll and accounting

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.460
myself.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:53.760
I don't, I hire someone to do it, but you know, you still have to be on top of stuff.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.920
Like I do think it's important to not just believe, oh, I'm outsourcing all of that.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.420
It'd be fine.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.680
Oh yeah.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.120
Yeah.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.380
Like I remember, like I learned how to do it and then I did what you did pretty fast,

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:02.920
but I agree.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.540
Like you can't, it's hard to, it would be hard to hire somebody had you not done it yourself.

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.020
Like you kind of like difficult to know like how to outsource it.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:09.200
Yeah.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.400
Actually even same with lawyers, like people have this idea.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.900
You just hire a lawyer and they magically do everything for you.

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:18.180
It's like, nah, you can't, you don't get good value out of a good lawyer unless you actually

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.340
know what you want and understand a bit of this stuff yourself.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.480
And then you can really utilize a professional.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.760
So I'll actually give the counterpoint.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:29.480
I think I, going into this, I had the exact opposite experience of, I did not want to

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.800
own any of this process.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.560
Certainly I've had to do a lot of this stuff.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.540
It's annoying, but like you can pay, you can buy your way out of it.

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.240
Like we, we got a PEO for, for us employees immediately.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.720
They handle payroll, they handle taxes.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.420
It was great.

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:45.920
We like got a high price lawyer who like helped walked us through a bunch of stuff.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.180
They handle corporation, they handle first contracts.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.120
It was great.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.700
We paid a bit of money, but that was fine.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:50.960
Yeah.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.160
And I think whether you have funding early in the thing, or you're completely trying to

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.280
bootstrap, it can make a decision there as well.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:01.580
We're mostly bootstrapping, but we've always had the one person whose job at the company

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:05.020
was to do all those, do the taxes and the payroll stuff.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.980
It's like the very first person who wanted to be an employee instead of a consultant.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:13.620
I said, okay, but you have to set up the payroll stuff with Quicken and all that.

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:15.700
You got to figure out your own situation.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.680
And he was like, okay, that's now part of my job.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.200
When he got tired of it, somebody else took it over.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.020
It's creative.

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:21.980
That's very creative.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:25.580
There are things that are a non-trivial amount of work, but it doesn't necessarily mean that

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.360
you as the founder have to do that work.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.540
It could be somebody you hire.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:28.820
Yeah.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:29.940
And it's not that expensive.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:30.340
Yeah.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:35.080
The other thing that's related to this for us, at least, is that most of our customers are

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:40.820
universities and becoming a vendor with the university is a potentially complicated process

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:44.200
where they look at your terms of service and scratch off a whole bunch of things and add

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:44.660
other things.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.100
And they want to see all these audits of your internal systems.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.220
And they want to know that you have insurance for this and that.

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:55.700
It's like this endless sequence of hurdles involving 50-page inscrutable documents.

01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:01.180
And it can be the business friction involving doing business with universities can be utterly

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:01.740
ridiculous.

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:06.120
And that's been a lot of work for us for the last two years, basically.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.160
It's worth pointing out, though, that while there's lots of hurdles, they're all really

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:09.800
short hurdles.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.720
Like, anybody can do this stuff.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:15.420
It's not like this doesn't require previous experience.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:19.180
Also, I think a hurdle becomes less of a hurdle if you do have, for example, customers that really

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:19.820
want your product.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:23.700
I was laughing when you talked about all the university purchasing process because we obviously

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.340
we have university customers as well.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.940
We have very large companies.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.260
So we know the process.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:32.080
But for us, it's like, you know, it becomes a lot easier if you have the champion in a company.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.060
It's like, well, we want that.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.360
Suddenly, things work.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.980
You know, if you cold calling universities and trying to sell them, I'm sure that's going

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.520
to be a very, very different story.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.100
It's been really weird for us because literally even today we're dealing with stuff like this.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:47.020
But there's hundreds of different universities we talk with and they're all different.

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.380
And they don't make their own rules.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.420
The rules are often state laws in the United States, at least.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:57.540
Like in Texas, to do business with one university, you have to pledge to not boycott Israel.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:01.620
That's just like a typical item in these like 50 page documents that you have to.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.940
There's a huge amount of weird friction like that.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:07.380
And like the state universities are the worst usually.

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.640
Oh my gosh.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:13.620
So I guess the takeaway though, sounds like, look, there's just something you learn it,

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.460
you go through it.

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.580
And now you're on the other side of it and it's great.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:16.940
Just do it.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.440
Yeah.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:17.980
Fantastic.

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:21.220
It's not as hard as creating a great product that people love.

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:21.760
That's harder.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.600
That's for sure.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:23.200
We're exciting.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.120
I know we could talk for another hour.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.120
Thanks for being here.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.180
It's great to chat with you.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:28.540
Yeah.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:28.820
Thanks.

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.140
Yep.

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:29.520
Thank you.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.260
Thanks for having us on.
