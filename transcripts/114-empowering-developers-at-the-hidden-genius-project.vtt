00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.420
As most of you know, learning to program opens doors.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.360
It takes everyday people and turns them into creators.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.560
Once you know programming and Python,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.020
you've passed through a door to a place with much more opportunity.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.060
Now consider the impact this could have if you grew up in an environment with less opportunity,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.260
with fewer people you knew leading the way into software careers.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.740
Today you'll meet Sean Valentine and Landon Miller helping run an amazing project

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.120
and Mohamed Abdullah and Malik Poole who graduated from this project.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.260
It's called the Hidden Genius Project and it helps young black men become developers and entrepreneurs.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.860
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 114,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.320
recorded live at PyCon 2017 in Portland, Oregon on May 20th, 2017.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:10.920
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.980

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.740
Welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.300
Thank you.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.700
Glad to be here.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.980
Yeah, it's great to have you guys.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.640
It's always wonderful to see people who have relatively fresh eyes looking at technology and programming

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.020
and all the stuff that goes on at these types of conferences in this ecosystem

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.340
and just hear how it's working for you as relatively new people in a programming.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.580
So I'm super excited to have you on the show.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.660
Malik, let's start with you.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.020
How did you get interested in programming and get into this project that we're going to talk about?

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.540
I guess it really started off when I was kind of young.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.980
I knew I wanted to be an engineer from like a really young age because I just loved messing with crap.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.620
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.740
Like I've broken and occasionally fixed a couple of remotes like when I was really little and stuff.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.940
And that's actually how I got involved with NSBE, which is another program, the National Society of Black Engineers.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.940
And, you know, we always had these robotics competitions.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.340
And there were, of course, different jobs for building the robot or handling the wires and stuff.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.920
And my favorite part to do was the computer sequences, right, to determine what the robot was going to do.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.260
And that's where I first found out that I really liked doing, you know, computer science and stuff like that.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.900
And from there, I heard about the Hidden Genius Project and I just jumped into it.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.100
That's a really inspiring story.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.600
That's awesome.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.720
Mohamed, how about yourself?

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.880
I would say for me in high school year, I was part of the Computer Academy.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.240
And through that, we learned front-end programming languages.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.260
And I really got interested in that.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.000
But I would say the major focus when I really got into computer science is when I joined the Hidden Genius Project,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.760
being able to build your own software through that program and connect with other companies.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.440
So I think that really gave me the interest into going into the computer science.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.460
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.860
I didn't know how it was for you guys growing up.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.040
I was never super into math and science and engineering when I was in high school.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.120
Once I got to college, I really, really loved it and went all in on it.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.680
But programming always seemed like this thing that is like super smart people do that.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.940
That's not really a thing for me when I was younger.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.420
Do you feel like this whole experience has kind of made it like a little more, hey, I can totally do this.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.200
Like this is a world that I fit in and I'm excited to be part of.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.600
Definitely.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.240
Yeah.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.460
The whole Hidden Genius experience and, of course, coming here to PyCon and everything.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.820
Yeah.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.100
Definitely feel like this is something I can dive into.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.840
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.500
How about you, Mahami?

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:10.420
I would say as far as looking into the computer science field, into that field, not a lot of representative diversity, not a lot of diversified people in that field.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:23.740
So I think being able to work with the Hidden Genius Project and Code for Girls, a lot of these programs that aim to bring diversity into the field, I think that's been really the major focus in today's era.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.520
Yeah, and I think that's really great.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.580
You know, in this community, we have a long ways to go.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.980
Yeah.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.380
But there are some steps that are being made.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:39.460
Like, so, for example, I think five years ago, 10 years, I don't know, sure, the number of speakers who were women, there was like 1%.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.480
Last year, I think it was 40%.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.820
There's a big move in this community to really be welcoming, and I think this Hidden Genius Project is just awesome.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.560
Have you guys got a chance to meet the Django Girls over there?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.540
No, actually.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.460
Yeah, they're a special outreach group for women in programming.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.520
Obviously a different group, but similar challenges that it's highly underrepresented.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.620
So, awesome.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.720
All right, Landon, let me ask you a little bit of a couple of questions about this project.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.520
Like, what's your involvement in Hidden Genius?

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.260
Well, me personally, I'm a site coordinator.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:18.680
I'm also an educator, so I work with the students, educating them, and in site coordinating, making sure that we get everything done that we need so that we can continue to grow and expand as we continue to move on.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.140
That's awesome.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.240
So, this is primarily a high school-oriented thing.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.740
You more or less got to be at some stage in your high school career to join this project.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.620
Yes, correct.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.900
Right.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.240
How did it get started, I guess?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.880
Let's start there.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.120
Like, what's, it's four or five years old, you guys said?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.240
Yeah, so we're in our fifth year in Oakland, California.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.180
And we're actually now developing, starting our first year in Richmond, California.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.640
So, our first expansion.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.500
Oh, how exciting.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.080
What was the motivation to get started?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.940
Just, we've got to do something that's not right, that there's this underrepresentation.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.700
And, like, why are these guys not going, this is what I should be doing?

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.700
This is amazing, right?

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.020
Like, even bigger than that.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:05.120
One of the things dealing with young youth, especially African American boys, is this stigma that's been dropped on us, that you have to work twice as hard for half the recognition.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.320
And when you look at the computer science field, this is really the field where your work can actually speak for you first.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.340
Before your name is seen, before your face is seen, your work is normally seen.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:27.440
And so, this was an avenue where we could actually show the creativity, the value, and how much we actually can touch our communities firsthand and let our work speak for us.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:36.520
That's really one of the more stronger motivational factors is being able to expose this lane, this avenue, to these students and to our geniuses.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:44.180
So that not only can they move forward in a career if they choose to in this path, but also know how to advocate for themselves in entrepreneurship.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.480
That's such a great message.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.520
I really think we still have a long ways to go for this to be purely a meritocracy.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:07:02.180
It's just what you do speaks for you because, obviously, what you get exposed to growing up, if your best friend's dad's a programmer, it seems really sort of like, oh, he does it, I can do it, whatever.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.300
But there is a lot more meritocracy here.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.980
It's a lot more, hey, I put this open source project up.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.180
It seemed really cool.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.180
People checked it out.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.420
And maybe they don't know anything about you.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.820
And a lot of your work does speak for you.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.020
And I think that's really interesting that you guys are identifying that basically as an avenue.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.280
And I have to quote our programs director.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.080
You know, tech is wherever you're at.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.340
Yeah.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.920
And so a lot of people look at the demographics of living in a certain way.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.640
But you don't have to necessarily be in Silicon Valley.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:47.660
You can be right where we're at and actually operate yourself with the Internet and whether it's building apps and building connections, showing these geniuses how they can actually be where they're at and they can actually be a reality right where they stand.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:54.420
And they don't have to be a part of a certain society, a certain community, or be of a certain stature to actually have an impact.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.080
That's so true.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.940
And I think communities like Python, where primarily the tools here are free.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.320
Python is free and open source.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.880
You don't buy a thing to use it.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.500
You just, if you have a computer and you have the Internet, you have this thing that you need, right?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.160
And so it's, I guess the barrier to entry is pretty low, right?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.260
There's not like you got to pay $1,000 for some fancy editor that's going to make it challenging.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:23.720
And that's the thing, you actually have to know that because regardless, there are $1,000 programs out there that people will sell thinking that that's what you need.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:31.140
But when we give the knowledge and we give the tools to these stones and see that they can go out and what we call fishing.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:42.600
You can go out and fish for yourself and find these avenues that you don't have to necessarily be a part of these $1,000 and $2,000 and $10,000 programs to actually get the job done.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.640
I think that's really awesome.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.260
It's really awesome.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.840
So tell me a little bit about the entrepreneurship side as well.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.140
I think the tech is super empowering, but there's also this entrepreneurship side, you say?

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:52.480
Yeah.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.280
So the entrepreneurship side is allowing the students, the geniuses, to actually be able to advocate for themselves in business.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:06.060
And not only using tech for somebody else's need, but to also be able to control what they do.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:16.280
So not to just operate as an employee, but to actually be able to advocate for themselves and operate as a business with tech instead of just being an employee.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.280
Yeah, that's really awesome.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.840
One of my favorite quotes is, if you don't build your dreams, someone will hire you to build theirs.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.340
I think you're giving them the power to build their dreams.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.460
And I think that's really amazing.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.080
And so super cool.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.620
Super cool.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.200
Let's switch it back to the alumni.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.420
Malik, let's start with you.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.740
Let's start by talking about your experience going through this program.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.140
You're about to wrap up your year-long program, right?

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.720
Yeah, actually, I'm already an alumni.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.880
I graduated last summer.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.900
Okay, so you just graduated.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.360
All right, so tell me how does it work.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.420
It's a year-long program at your high school, right?

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.140
No, you have to be in high school.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:50.800
It's not at...

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.020
It's a two-year intensive program.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.520
It starts during the summer.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.680
We have six weeks during the summer, or seven weeks.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.520
Yeah, so there's like an intense kickoff.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.620
Like, let's just all get together and really learn this.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:02.780
Right.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.600
And then you kind of carry it on throughout the year?

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.200
Right, right.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.040
So, yeah, Monday through Thursday is like just the normal programming, really, where

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.820
it's, you know, we have our coding classes, then we have our entrepreneurship classes, then

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.040
we have a portion of the day called leadership, which is more or less basically a space for

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.440
us to just talk about life in general, really, and also to try and develop and correlate these

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.740
like leadership skills and also the things that we'll need to just be successful in life

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.200
in general.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.080
And so that's Monday through Thursday.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.920
And then on Friday during the summer, we'll take trips, field trips to actual tech companies

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.820
within the Bay Area.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.540
We visited Google, Facebook.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.460
We visited Square, all that.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.940
Yeah, you guys are right in the right location.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.560
Yeah.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:43.980
Yeah.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.540
Yeah.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.540
I grew up in Kansas City.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.420
There were not so many tech companies to go see.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.740
I could have gone visit the newspaper, I guess, but it's all the same.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.320
Yeah.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.040
After the end of the summer program, it starts up again in like September.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.940
And Wednesdays, we meet up at Claremont Middle School, which is also out in Oakland.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.760
That's when we basically have the same little programming that we had during the summer, you

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.320
know, Monday through Friday and all that.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.480
But on Wednesdays, we'll have like short programming times.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.440
And we'll just keep doing the same thing after school on Wednesdays that we did during the

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:14.620
summer.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.740
And on Saturdays, we'll have like every month, the first Saturday of the month, I think,

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.420
we'll have like even larger meetings, like back at the Glover Center where Hidden Genius

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.280
is based from.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:24.560
Okay.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.800
And so that goes through the school year after your first summer.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.060
And then during your second summer, it's more or less the same thing, except you're more

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.900
independent your second summer, really.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.600
It's more about developing your own personal project.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.820
Whatever app you decided to create in Hidden Genius, that's your time to actually start working

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.880
on that app.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.380
And so you guys have different technologies that you cover.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.680
I know you did Python some of the time, but also you said JavaScript.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.500
Yeah, JavaScript, Python.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.520
We did C++, Ruby.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.200
And, you know, yeah, we just, yeah, we actually started off in a program called Scratch.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.800
Yeah, okay.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:05.600
Which is basically just like your basic, you drag and drop block stuff.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.660
This is like little animation stuff.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.380
We like made like little games and stuff.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.620
But that was basically just to get the algorithm part of it.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:11.800
Right.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.220
Right.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.360
That's one thing one of our mentors, Bob O'Lemon, always says is that we always have to get

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.600
the algorithm first before we even touch the keyboard.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.240
That's a lot of what we focus on at first.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.760
And then we focus on each individual language.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.260
I think, I don't know about your call, but mine, we started out with HTML and JavaScript.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.320
And that's how we started out.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.540
And then we got into Python.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.840
And after that, Ruby and C++.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.420
Yeah.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.980
What did you think of the different languages?

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.720
Definitely liked Python and JavaScript the best.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.060
I think those are the languages I'm more proficient in.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.960
And you got to C++ at the end where you're like, what is all this?

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.280
Yeah.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.820
Yeah.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.320
Yeah.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:46.900
Yeah.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.900
See, yeah, I wasn't going to bring that.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.760
We tried.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.400
We tried to take a C++ course.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.880
That was a different story.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.240
Yeah.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.820
You know, C++ is a good skill to have, but you shouldn't do it day to day, in my opinion.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.880
You should pick something like Python or JavaScript that's more productive, right?

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.180
It'll serve you well, but it's, I know, a painful experience to go through.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.260
Very painful experience.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.700
All right, Mohamed, maybe same question to you.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.280
Like, maybe tell us what your experience was like and going through it.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:12.860
Give us a summary.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.400
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.440
So, I was a part of the cohort, too, like I said.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.420
Our first year, the same thing, two-year program, intensive summer work.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:24.240
But for my first year, we focused on programming languages like Python.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.300
Python was a major, major focus.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.200
HTML, CSS.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:34.800
We worked with APIs with Flask, JSON, and all those ones that connect with that.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.860
Yeah, learned, like, a lot of back-end web technologies.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:37.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:43.420
And then throughout that first year, building empathy with our cohort members, being able

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.560
to connect, have that one closeness.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:50.400
I think that's the main focus of the whole program, being able to connect with each other.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.540
So, the first year, we did that.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.220
And then our second year, we built our software.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.160
I used Python as my back-end, as my major back-end.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.360
So, my app was called SpendWisely.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.060
SpendWisely.today.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.500
That's actually...

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.500
It's online now?

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.100
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.800
All right, I'll put a link in the show notes.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.740
It's an alpha mode right now.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.020
Okay.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.260
It's being worked on.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:16.080
The whole goal of it is to help teenagers buy things based on their interests at the lowest

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.540
price.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.560
I did this because we had a cohort member in our group who would come in every week, and

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.060
we'd buy these shoes for $200.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.560
I'm like, this guy's wasting his money.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.440
Come on, Isaiah.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:33.040
So, I was like, I'm going to have to build.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.540
So, the thing is, we look at the problems that we face and then try to build solutions for

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:37.740
that.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:43.340
So, throughout those two years, we've learned a lot of intensive programming languages.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.020
That's really cool.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:44.240
Yeah.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.100
I mean, your idea from the app came from basically solving the problems you see around

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:48.340
you.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.500
And I think there's a lot of that in technology.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.900
There's a lot of that in the startup space is, I see something that's hard for me.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:59.560
So, it's probably, there's probably a million other people who would like to solve this problem

00:14:59.560 --> 00:14:59.940
as well.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.440
And maybe I can make a company or a product or something out of it, right?

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:09.380
You guys spoke about how a lot of the goal of the program is like social and like working

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.820
together and like peer mentoring.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:16.900
Was it surprising to you to learn that software is kind of a social thing when it, I think the

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:22.220
prototypical idea is like you go sit in a basement by yourself with a computer and it turns out

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.420
like there's actually this group effect.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.040
I don't know.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.880
What were your conceptions?

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.200
Like maybe you didn't think of programming and sitting in the basement.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.820
That's how it was when I started.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.820
I kind of went in just without any real conception about what really lied ahead of me.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.060
Yeah.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.140
I'm going to build stuff.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:37.960
Yeah.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.600
I'm going to meet those groups and I'm just going to totally do it.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:40.940
Yeah.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.500
All right.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:41.660
Yeah.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.320
That's awesome.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.940
Well, I mean, I think it really quickly introduces you to the fact that this is a social thing with

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.380
like a big human component, even though it's just right typing on a keyboard.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.100
It doesn't seem like it.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.520
It's funny the way they respond to your question.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.380
They truly didn't see the community part of it.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.280
I don't think that it wasn't that Malik or Mohammed didn't see the community part of

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:02.380
it.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.000
I think they were introduced to it as a component.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.240
And so their idea of the coding and of the programming never unincluded.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.800
Yeah.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.100
It was just that from the start.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.340
It was just that from the start.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.660
We build cohorts intentionally.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.080
They build their relationships that Mohammed described and the empathy for each other

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.980
from the start.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.120
And so they've never coded in a room alone.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.260
They never approached it as an alone thing.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.320
They've always approached it as a part of their community.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.240
And you talk about why we do it.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.940
And a lot of times I came or Landon, part of our program team, we'll talk about how we intentionally

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.320
aren't doing this to supply the job market out there.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:53.060
But to inspire these youth to become creators and add to society in a way that's a value add

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.320
and not just another.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.720
You know, we love our social media tools.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.360
We want to inspire the lives of these young men and make sure that they're creating change

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.560
within themselves and their communities.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.020
Yeah.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.740
I think that's a really, really good point.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.100
I'm glad you brought it up.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.520
Teaching technology often gets confused with computer skills.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.520
You know, I can work with Word or I can surf the internet or whatever.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:23.980
And what we end up with is a lot of people who have computer skills who basically are consumers

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.040
of technology and not creators.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:31.480
And I think what society needs and would benefit a lot from is having more creators.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.360
And you guys are basically instilling all the ingredients these guys need to become creators

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.140
and not just consumers of technology, right?

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:43.720
And more so not only what we're giving them, that environment that they have that they can

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.700
pull from each other.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.240
Like you hear the geniuses talk now, I am part of cohort two.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.780
I am part of cohort three.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.440
You know, it's not necessarily I used to be.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.680
You know, we have 100% retention rate here.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.700
And it's to the fact where they're always a part of this.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.740
Like this is always.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.820
It's inclusive.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.780
So even when they finish their program and they graduate, they are still a part of the

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.540
Hidden Genius Project.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.160
They are still a part of their cohort.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.420
I remember the same stigma that you talk about where you would think of that guy in the basement

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.140
with his computer.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.000
And that was what we looked at as computer guys.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.420
Yeah.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.940
You know, but the way that the environment that they have, like they're actually pulling

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.140
from each other's geniuses and each other's strength by being with each other.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.720
And so they're always around.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:37.580
And so even when they finish theirs, they come back to actually start mentoring the next cohorts.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:43.300
And now we even have junior educators where we're sending them out to actually not only

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.340
take the information that they have, but to be able to give that to others.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.120
It is a continuous process.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.520
So this is something that they weren't just a part of for 15 months.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.860
This is a track for their life.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.080
That's really great that you guys are doing that.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.460
You guys feel like this is something that is ongoing.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.300
You know, there's two areas where that kind of resonates a lot, where I feel like it's

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.580
actually a little bit imbalanced.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.020
You know, it's the meritocracy stuff where I said it, a lot of times it's meritocracy,

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:09.960
but sometimes it's not.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:16.120
Where it's not are if you go to places like MIT, you have connections to all these people

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.940
who are starting these companies and have access to all this stuff.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.320
If you're in one of these like Y Combinator, Accelerator type places, the cohort that you

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.500
went through, they all stay together and connected and help each other out.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.140
And a lot of people like for me in particular, I didn't have that.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.280
I'd learned programming really well, but I didn't have this social component.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.080
And so it feels like you're kind of bringing this really powerful support group and sort

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.100
of success amplifier to the cohorts.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.800
It's part of our foundation.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:50.220
Our founders were brought together by a scholarship fund that took high school students from all

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.040
over the country and supplied them with scholarships to Ivy League schools.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:20:00.520
And those young men, after graduating, two of them came back from Harvard, one from Pittsburgh

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:07.040
and one from Compton and wanted to develop a software company that or gaming that taught

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.980
financial literacy through mobile gaming.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.940
And when they came to the Bay Area, right, that's where you're if you're going to create

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.160
something, that's where you go.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:19.960
The issue was that they could not find any, not any, but they couldn't find the right kind

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.560
of talent to help create the game from the African-American community.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.100
And they thought that was ridiculous.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:25.440
Right.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:31.620
You have this heavy African-American population right in the heart of Silicon Valley and they're

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.700
not involved.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.720
It'd be like going to the Bronx and you can't find break dancers.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.200
Right.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.020
This is where rap is and you don't have any break dancers.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.000
Exactly.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.440
Right.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.680
And we're laughing, but we're laughing the same way.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.440
Like this is ridiculous.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:44.840
Yeah.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.340
And they started, they went out, right.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:50.280
They recruited from their cohort from the Round Brown scholarship.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:56.400
Our founding executive director is a Brandon Nicholson is a recipient of that reward as well.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:02.460
From their cohort, pick the talent and then put together a team that picked kids from off

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.300
the, off the streets and not in a literal sense, but, you know, we grabbed students that

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.780
were on reach away and just started bringing them into office early.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:16.920
And while we were creating the game, we were mentoring and teaching the students how the coding

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.700
aspect, the entrepreneurial aspect and the leadership aspect that has built into what we see today,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:27.940
five cohorts later, a programs director, a programs coordinator, innovative educators,

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:35.340
a solid team of African-American males that have the desire to give back to their communities.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:41.340
If you're founded on that and you hire on that, it's only, it's so much easier to emit that type

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:46.900
of energy so that the students pick up on that and utilize that within their own cohorts and

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.620
their own cells.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.360
you can already see the domino effect being that we're five cohorts deep.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:52.500
Yeah.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.620
You guys are five years in now.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.980
How many people have been through the program?

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.000
I didn't say it.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.240
We're 50 students, 50 kids.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.360
And that's in our intensive 15 month cohort.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:00.720
Yeah.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.400
Now, if you want to talk about the type, the number of students overall that we've touched,

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.520
we're in the, we're in a thousand.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:06.520
We're in the, we're in the thousand.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:25.380
We all love Python for its tremendous productivity benefits, but getting the best performance takes

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:25.900
some work.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.120
What if you could get out of the box, easy access to high performance Python?

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.680
Intel distribution for Python developers delivers just that.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:39.020
Get close to 100 times better performance for certain functions when using NumPy, SciPy,

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:44.340
Scikit-learn linked with the optimized native libraries like Intel Math Kernel Library, access

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.620
efficient multithreading, and Python projects like Numba and Cython.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:54.220
Try the Intel distribution for Python and experience performance today at talkpython.fm/Intel.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:01.800
And profile your Python and native C, C++ applications for performance hotspots with Intel VTune amplifier.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.180
With Intel, it's all about performance.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:18.000
Because outside of what we do in our intensive immersion, we do catalyst programs, one offs,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.620
or six week programs with like-minded organizations or organizations that are mission aligned.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.540
We work with foster kids with the Casey Foundation.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.900
And you can see why they wouldn't be able to, that demographic wouldn't be able to participate

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.760
in a more intensive immersion.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:39.600
But we still debunk and introduce and share the knowledge and the skill base with that demographic.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.740
We operate out of Juvenile Justice Hall.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:47.060
We go into the cell blocks of these young men and teach these young men.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.420
That's another demographic that is looked over.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.780
We work with student athletes as well.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.680
Oakland Unified School District.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.540
Fam First with Marshawn Lynch.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.960
Also with the Warriors.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.060
We do sports coding, drawing out the analytics.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.060
There's a whole data science in sports.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.440
You can go crazy with that, right?

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.960
And so making sure that the students are understanding that technology can meet their passions as well.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.580
And so it's not something that's, again, you keep, everybody has that, you know, connotation,

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.940
that coding has to do with a few guys in this dark room, you know, and all you see is monitors.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:29.620
But there's so much that tech touches that these young men need to be exposed to so they can start contributing to society and have a value added.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.720
Yeah, that's really great.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:37.780
Especially the going to the Juvenile Hall where you're basically helping these guys that maybe have no direction.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:44.320
Say, look, here's a direction with cool technology that you can go in that will really change your life possibly, right?

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.660
Yeah, I mean, they're in there, what, 23 hours a day without any recreation.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.420
And then if you've seen a jail book cart, it's totally...

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.440
It can't be too engaging, right?

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.080
It can't be too engaging.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.480
And then, you know, the basketball.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.320
And so what are we telling them that they'll be able to do when they get out of here?

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:10.240
But once you see that inspiration from after someone has created something, even through scratch, it's hard to bring in, you know, more advanced technologies into the system.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:10.600
Right.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.880
You've got to build up over time with a real programming language, right?

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.600
So we use scratch to introduce them.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.700
But just that spark of inspiration, you can't take it back.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.400
Yeah, it's true.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.760
Once it's lit, you can't take it back.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:27.180
Even that idea of introducing that you can do something different and showing the impact of that.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.600
And so it may not be their situation.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.500
It might be somebody they notice in the situation.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:37.440
It's the same idea that we introduce in the immersion program.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.900
Which is why you heard Muhammad say, like, I looked at one of my peers.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.040
And that gave me the idea for the app that I came across.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.760
The fact that you can actually make a difference.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:52.260
A lot of times you have ideas, but you just don't know what to do with them or how to go forth with them.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:57.620
And this is showing a path that you can actually make a difference and you can actually affect your community.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:03.100
We had one of our alums come back and he talked about when people pass on.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:09.420
And usually we expect our loved ones or people who have died in the past to surround our bedside.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:16.920
He said, what if you saw your opportunities and your ideas around your bedside that the ones that you didn't bring to life?

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:23.880
And what if they were crying out to you because you didn't push forward and do what you needed to do to bring them forward?

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.660
It's a powerful visualization.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.680
It's mind-blowing.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:38.200
And so with that, as a staff, as a cohort, we kind of strive to make sure that those ideas and those opportunities aren't crying by our bedsides when we pass on.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.400
We don't die with those great ideas.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:40.620
Yeah.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:46.560
We're so often concerned about taking a chance or trying something new and not being good at it or failing or whatever.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.120
But it's really the regrets are the things you look back on.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.340
Like, why didn't I try this?

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.180
Rather than, oh, I tried and failed and I tried something else later.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.440
Right?

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.100
So it's amazing.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.800
So I'm going to bring it back to these guys.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.060
But I have one more question for you two before I do.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.040
How do people get started?

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.600
Like, especially in sort of two angles to this.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.820
In Oakland, if guys are listening, they want to be part of this program, what do they do?

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:11.380
Go to our website, www.HiddenGeniusProject.org.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.900
You can apply online.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.660
All our contacts are listed on our website.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.000
Is there a fee?

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.680
No.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.060
There's no fee, actually.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:19.220
That's awesome.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:26.320
The kids get to enjoy each other and not have to worry about the pressures of fees or anything of that nature.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.520
We try to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.340
We want to inspire lives.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.120
We're not in it.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.860
Definitely not in it for the money.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.220
Yeah, that's cool.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:35.900
That's cool.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.380
And if people are listening in other cities going, I'd like to do this myself.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.640
You got any advice for them or any way they can get started?

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.600
Yeah, contact us.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.100
Contact us.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.660
Contact at HiddenGeniusProject.org.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.600
Our program's team and director is eagerly awaiting.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.180
We want to get across the country.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.000
We want to be in a city near you.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.060
The problems and the issues that these young men are facing are the same.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:02.300
And we want to inspire opportunities to all of these young men throughout our nation.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.020
I think it's extremely important that we collaborate and we work together.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.040
So any other cities, definitely reach out.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.960
A lot of times what we do is we start up all these organizations.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.460
We start up all these names.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.460
And we all start pulling from the same resources.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.680
And then we end up pulling against each other.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.780
So with that being said, what we're doing, we expect it to be across the nation.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.180
And we're willing to be able to be a part of that in any city.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:29.940
That's awesome.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.860
Yeah, very cool.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.020
So if you're out there listening and this sounds like a great idea, you want to be part of it, reach out to these guys.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.260
I'll put the links in all the show notes so they can get to them.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.720
All right, let me ask you guys a couple of questions about the conference here.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.160
So you get to come to this conference.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:48.340
There's like 3,000 people in this great hall just totally geeking out about technology.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.180
What's your impression of this conference?

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:54.560
Well, this is my first conference at PyCon.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.580
First impression is a big thing.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:04.740
Being able to come together as coders, you know, coders from all over the world to come into a conference and to discuss ideas.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:10.440
These are where I always like to go by this quote where it goes by, it says that small minds,

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.740
discuss people, average minds discuss events, and great minds discuss ideas.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.300
And I think this is what we're doing here.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.300
We're collecting moments, not things.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.300
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:20.760
Yeah.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.140
That's amazing.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:22.780
Awesome.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.040
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.660
That's a great quote.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.440
Yeah, Malik?

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:31.060
The first thing I thought was it was pretty cool that I like, I saw a lot of stuff that I recognized here, right?

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:36.960
Like a lot of stuff that I've actually used over the course of like all the things that I've done in like coding and stuff.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.520
And I just thought it was cool.

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:49.680
Like I could really see myself one day with my own business or my own project, just setting up shop, you know, here at PyCon or any other real coding convention and just talking about the stuff that I'm working on.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.620
All that stuff.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.020
Like I'm just really enjoying it.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.020
You know, like you said, everyone's just here geeking out.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.980
So I just came here to geek out with them.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.220
Yeah, we're definitely taking it to another level and geeking out.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:58.620
It's awesome.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.940
I love coming here every year.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:04.140
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Hired.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.540
Hired is the platform for top Python developer jobs.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:13.020
Create your profile and instantly get access to thousands of companies who will compete to work with you.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:20.160
Take it from one of Hired's users who recently got a job and said, I had my first offer within four days and I ended up getting eight offers in total.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.400
I've worked with recruiters in the past, but they were pretty hit and miss.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.220
I tried LinkedIn, but I found Hired to be the best.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:30.420
I really like knowing the salary up front and privacy was also a huge seller for me.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.440
Well, that sounds pretty awesome, doesn't it?

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.320
But wait until you hear about the signing bonus.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.880
Everyone who accepts a job from Hired gets a $300 signing bonus.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.880
And as Talk Python listeners, it gets even sweeter.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:46.240
Use the link talkpython.fm/hired and Hired will double the signing bonus to $600.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.320
Opportunity is knocking.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.040
Visit talkpython.fm/hired and answer the door.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.740
That's so inspiring.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:31:00.820
Do you feel like seeing these companies and these libraries and the people who create them that you already know and use?

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.800
Do you feel like, wow, I'm like more of this community already than I realized?

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.680
Yeah.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.060
A little bit of effect like that?

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:07.480
Yeah.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:07.920
Yeah.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.380
Definitely have that effect on it, you know?

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:10.720
Okay.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.000
I would say that as well.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:21.340
Just going to different exhibits and seeing I use certain websites and I see the actual them setting up here and actually talking about it and being able to meet them.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.000
These are the guys that build it.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.920
They're like, you're here.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.380
So that's really awesome, being able to connect with them, learn from them.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:27.660
Yeah.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.420
And that speaks volumes to more of what you were talking about, like the social aspect.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.240
Like it's a real community, right?

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.020
Technology and coding and all of that.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:40.020
That's another thing that's really at the center of the Hidden Genius Project is really trying to,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:46.360
not only just create that community, but making sure that we also give back to the community in any way possible.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:52.260
So that's really why we have the lens that we have with creating these technologies and stuff.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.720
The community problem that I was trying to solve was recidivism, right?

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.640
In my app, Hire, which stands for Helping Inmates Reach Employment.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:04.900
And so it's just database, a list of jobs that's open specifically for people who were once incarcerated.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:10.700
And so that was really targeting, you know, like Muhammad got his idea for his app from a friend.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.340
I got mine really from my uncle who's actually serving upstate right now in prison.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.800
So again, another one of these things in your life, you're like, here's a problem that I really wish I could solve.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.840
And I bet I could solve it for a lot of people, not just.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.280
Right.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:21.760
Right.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:28.360
And so, yeah, just the Hidden Genius Project just gives us a real platform to really try and solve those problems, right?

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:34.760
Using technology or even just helping us become creative enough to find other ways to try and solve it.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:39.340
Yeah, I think one of the really powerful things is I think it's awesome that they're teaching entrepreneurship.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.180
And if you guys have businesses, that's like the peak, right?

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:42.860
That's like awesome.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:43.120
Yeah.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:49.120
But I think programming and giving you guys this creative programming skill and this background of like, these are problems.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:58.720
I just I can go solve them is no matter what you do, if you go into biology, if you go into music, whatever, like you can take these skills and just amplify whatever you are.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.520
I guess I'm saying this more for people listening.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.540
It's like we don't need 10 million more programmers.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.240
We need 10 million more creators.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.080
And some of those are code.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.540
Some of those are amplifying with code or whatever, right?

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:10.880
Yeah.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:21.900
I would say that for me right now, just based on where my focus is, you know, looking into I'm really into like international relations, you know, diplomacy and being able to adapt technology into that.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:28.900
You know, I work with a nonprofit Project Feed Yemen and we're helping to combat the starvation in Yemen.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.900
Mel nurse kids fund that country.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.080
I'm from Yemen.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.680
But the whole thing is being able to adapt technology.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:45.220
So I'm using technology to build a website, you know, for Project Feed Yemen and connect with other mentors who need help building their website, clean their website, you know.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:50.600
So having that outside lens through creating different things.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.440
That's really awesome.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.100
That's really awesome.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.860
So we probably should wrap it up.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.020
They're starting to do presentations over there and it's going to be loud on our microphone.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.660
So let me ask you guys one parting question before we wrap this up.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.340
Maybe two.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:09.180
So people out there listening who maybe are not in one of these programs, they want to get started.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:14.420
Maybe they don't know anybody in their community who's doing this, but they're like, I really want to be an engineer or developer.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.220
What advice do you have for them?

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.460
What would you say to that person?

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.280
Go fish.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.280
That's like Sean mentioned earlier.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.480
That's one thing that is really taught in Hidden Geniuses.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.800
We're never really spoon fed information, right?

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.240
And that's one thing that you should never really seek to actually be is just give information.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.800
You need to know how to go find it yourself.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.180
That's part of really being a coder.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:39.340
It's another thing that I learned in Gene is that coders are actually pretty lazy.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:39.920
Yeah.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.200
Yeah.

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.360
So at this, like everything is online.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.180
There'll always be something that you can get from the internet, right?

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:50.460
In order to learn for yourself, in order to teach yourself in that aspect.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.480
And like you said, the barrier to entry is very low for becoming a coder as well.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:55.800
Yeah.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.020
It's lower than people think.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:57.480
Yeah.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:57.820
Yeah.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.320
A lot, a lot lower than people think.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.100
So it's just try and find a way to go fish.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.260
Get the information yourself.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.760
You can teach yourself.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.760
Or you could come join the Hidden Genius Project if you want to.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.360
Yeah.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.340
You can also do that.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.960
Or if you're not here, try to get one started, right?

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.380
Right.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.900
If you're somewhere where it's not.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.800
Muhammad, how about you?

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:22.000
I agree with what he said, you know, being able to have that access going out to fish.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.220
But I think it all goes back to yourself, you know.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.900
Whoever the individual is, being to teach your own self.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.740
So go out, you know.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.620
Go explore.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:31.840
It's an open field.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.060
Technology is so big nowadays.

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.220
It's early days.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.900
Even though it looks like it's all well formed, there's so many things to create.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.200
Yeah.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:38.620
Yeah.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.320
Yep.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.080
Definitely.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.620
All right.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.620
Well, Muhammad, Malik, thank you so much for being on the show.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.620

Appreciate it.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.240
All right.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:47.500
Thank you.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:47.580
Bye.
