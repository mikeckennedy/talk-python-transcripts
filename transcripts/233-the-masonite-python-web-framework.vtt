00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.220
Folks, it's not like the old days where there were just a couple of web frameworks for building applications with Python.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.500
These days, there are so many web frameworks to choose from.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.640
One of those is the Masonite web framework created by Joseph Mancusio.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:21.240
Joseph is here today to tell us all about Masonite, what makes it special, its core value proposition for web developers, and much more.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.740
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 233, recorded September 11th, 2019.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:46.520
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.600
This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Twitter where I'm @mkennedy.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.040
Joe, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.960
Thank you. Thanks for having me.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.940
Yeah, it's great to have you here.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.080
I'm really excited to talk about Masonite and sort of do a quick survey and dive into these modern web frameworks.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.160
That's going to be a lot of fun.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.940
I think a thousand flowers are blooming these days on the Python web framework world.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:23.860
We've had some stalwart web frameworks, primarily Flask and Django, but Pyramid and before then some others like TurboGears and whatnot.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.960
But those all have been around for a really long time and slowly growing or, you know, really slowly maturing.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.440
And I feel just like every month there's a new interesting framework.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.060
Yeah, yeah. I think that's exactly right.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.020
And when I started Masonite, I thought I was doing really, really good.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.040
And then I guess it's because I got into the ecosystem.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.840
And then all of a sudden I saw like a whole bunch of other frameworks start like blossoming from that.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.220
And it's probably because I just wasn't, you know, in it, in the ecosystem more.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.080
So I just saw it more.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.840
But yeah, there's, it seems like every, every couple of months there's something new coming up.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.060
Yeah.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.240
It's really positive, I think, but also creates some confusion.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.260
We'll talk about that in a bit.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.820
Before we get to it, though, let's start with your story.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.540
How'd you get into programming and into Python?

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.600
I always never know which story to tell, like the long story or the short story.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.860
But the medium story, I guess, would be that in high school, in ninth grade, I got kicked out of school for a bunch of stuff, like fighting and stuff like that.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.420
I was a bad kid.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.200
And I had, I was homeschooled for like eight months after that until the next school year.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.420
And I was very, very bored.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.900
And I didn't really know what to do.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.960
And at the time, when I was 14, I was actually into Pokemon too.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.400
So I was like, you know what, I'm gonna, like, I'm gonna just play this Pokemon game.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.320
And then I got into, and I wanted to like build websites too, because I had a lot of time on my hands.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.960
So then I got this website, you know, I started learning like C and then like C++, and I didn't really like it.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.400
And then I was like, you know what, I'm gonna start trying to develop websites, maybe.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.880
And then I got into PHP, because I found really good documentation.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.440
I mean, good YouTube tutorials about PHP.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.560
Yeah, and it seems like PHP is like a real quick and easy way into web development.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.640
Like a lot of folks go that route, and they kind of, I don't know, graduate to like more formal languages.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.420
Python.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.700
Yeah.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.700
Intermediate level, I guess there.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.480
Formal languages.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.880
Yeah, sure.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.080
Yeah, so I got into PHP, and I watched, you know, the new Boston.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.760
I don't know if you've ever seen so many tutorials.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.200
Yeah, right.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.920
They did a ton of tutorials and stuff.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.440
I haven't seen a lot of stuff from them lately.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.020
But yeah, they were on all over YouTube for a while, weren't they?

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.360
He hasn't made a video in like four years.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.660
He sort of just dove off to 50,000.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.040
But at the time, he was huge.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.360
He only had like maybe 40,000, 50,000 subscribers, I think, at the time.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.120
And now he's probably at like three or four million.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.840
But yeah, I went from there.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.560
And then I took sort of this Pokemon thing.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.860
And then I used that as my base of a project to build like this website.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.940
And then I built, you know, this website.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.200
And I had people on Tumblr, I think it was at the time, like start using it.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.500
And I thought it was like amazing that you could build something and have people use it.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.980
It was like, it was crazy.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.820
So I got into PHP.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.280
And then from there, I really just took off PHP.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.200
Like from like ninth grade to when I graduated high school, you know, 18 years old, I just coded nonstop.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.200
I didn't do any homework.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.320
I didn't do anything else besides like go to school, come home, and then just start coding.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.120
Oh, that's pretty cool.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.760
Like it was just your deep passion, huh?

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.080
Yeah, it just clicked.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.780
And I had like this entrepreneurial spirit.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.940
And I realized that I can create these websites and sort of make money from them.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.000
I can monetize them.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.980
I can put ads on them.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.400
Did you have friends who were working, like making like $4 an hour minimum wage?

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.160
And you're like, you know what I'm doing?

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.660
Yes, I cut them checks.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.360
I cut them checks for like $1.25.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.980
And I gave it to them in class.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.660
Yeah.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.680
How'd you know that?

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.620
Did you, I feel like.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.480
No, no, no.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.500
I just mean like they had other jobs, like minimum wage jobs.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.680
And you had like these businesses making real money.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.160
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.060
I didn't know they were actually working for you directly.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.960
But I imagine that you probably in high school had, like I had friends.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.540
And even for a while, I worked at like a pizza place.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.840
I think I made like $3.25 an hour, right?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.660
It was the minimum I could be paid, you know, to go there.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.400
And I mean, eventually I went and did some other really wild stuff that is like super funny and

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.900
outrageous and not probably, it'll be too much of a diversion to cover now.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.720
But it's just really funny to probably contrast like you and like high school building these

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.780
sites, you know, running interesting things and folks going, well, you know, I'm bagging

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.140
groceries.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.440
Now there's anything wrong with that, but it's quite the contrast.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.720
Yeah.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.140
That's so true.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.680
Even my stepbrother now, he does like marketing or something for like, you know, a big like

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.480
a corporate guy.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.040
And he's like, dude, he's like, I wish when you were in the other room, just coding nonstop.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.540
He's like, I wish I like, I did it with you.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.320
And like, we learned coding together.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.700
He goes now, because now you're, you know, you're off doing this job, doing this great big

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.320
project that you're, you know, your job.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.600
And he's like, I'm sort of sitting here like at a cubicle, you know, like just banging

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.000
paperwork.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.340
You really got into it.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.400
It sounds like you just really independently went after PHP and Belize sites and that's,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.660
that's super cool.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.640
So where'd Python come from?

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.540
When I was 18, I joined the army and I came back and I was still sort of doing programming

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.740
within the army because it was, you know, it's a passion of mine.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.180
It's a hobby.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.060
And then when I got out, I wanted to build a POS ordering system that you see like a, like

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.680
a kiosk almost like a pizza place.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.280
So I wanted to build that.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.360
So I wanted to learn something new and do it.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.300
So I picked up Python just because it was just something new.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.820
It was cool.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.820
They seemed to be rising at the time with like the whole data science thing and machine learning.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.960
So I thought it was cool to sort of pick it up.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.640
And then from there I built, I needed to pick a framework and the obvious one at the time

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.660
seemed to be Django.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.200
So I picked up Python for about a month.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.600
I learned on like Code Academy.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.200
I did like all the basics and then I picked up a framework and then I started building this

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.580
thing out.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.100
It took me about probably eight months or so to build this thing.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.700
And then I actually said, all right, you know, I'm going to start trying to sell this

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.880
thing.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.960
In hindsight, it was actually crap.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.540
But at the time I thought it was super cool and I wanted to create a company.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:02.680
And one of my all time goals in life is to have a 100 person software development company.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.660
Yeah, that's a good goal.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.640
I put that in the same ballpark as like...

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.920
It's nice.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.480
It's concrete.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.760
Yeah.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.060
Yeah.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.480
It was like Gary Vaynerchuk's like want to buy the jets sort of thing.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.580
So I sort of put it there.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.680
Like it probably never happened.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.980
Even if you look at like Basecamp, like even they have like a couple dozen employees,

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.300
I think.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.600
And they're like a huge company.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.860
So like a hundred person software development company is gigantic.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.680
But anyway, I digress.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.940
So I built this thing and I even went like door to door to like businesses to try to sell

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.340
this thing.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.460
What was that experience like?

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.260
Were they receptive?

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.760
Were they just like, what are you doing here?

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.240
Like you're from the internet.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.680
Why are you in my place, my pizza place or whatever?

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.660
That's exactly what it was.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.360
But actually my whole philosophy is that I'm really not afraid to fail.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.920
And even if I fail, I learned something from it.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.080
And it was super nerve wracking to like walk in, just cold walk into a business.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.340
But I figured like even if I fail, like I'll probably learn something from this guy.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.320
And what I actually learned, which was interesting is that when I went in and I asked them if they,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.980
if you know, is your manager there?

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.620
I tried to like, I had like a whole pitch like lined out.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.700
And they basically said that, oh no, sorry, we've already tried some and it just, it just

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.400
doesn't fit us.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.860
And I thought that was interesting because I was walking into companies that didn't have

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.560
it, you know, online, but it makes sense that they've probably been around for five,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.140
10 years.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.540
And if they don't have one, they had to have tried one already.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:25.640
So I use that failure to sort of repitch into, oh, I know you've tried something before,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.360
but maybe you should try this instead.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.860
I see.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.060
It didn't work before.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.820
And here's why it's going to work this time.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.200
Right.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:31.800
And something like that.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.240
But nobody really went for it.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.940
And I'm not really a sales guy.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.980
I'm very introverted sometimes.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.320
I call myself an ambivert.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.000
So I'm like, I'm sort of introverted, but I'm extroverted in comfortable environments.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.360
Right.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:44.960
If that makes sense.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.720
I think that describes a lot of tech people, honestly.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.360
Yeah.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:47.680
Yeah.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.320
That's probably true.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.980
I think this is the start with most people in general.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.060
I mean, very few people I think that I've, I've experienced are really introverted.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.320
Like once you get familiar with them and they get comfortable with you,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.460
they're just like off the wall.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.220
Yeah, for sure.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.380
This is a really cool way to get into Python.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.660
And where did you go from there?

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.640
So from there, I learned a, I wanted to learn a new technology.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.840
Each year I try to make it a theme.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.400
That year I wanted to learn frameworks.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.240
So I learned like Django and Python.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.240
And then I wanted to, I already came from PHP.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.480
So I wanted to learn Laravel because I never learned Laravel all the time.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.620
So then I created a new site.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.640
You know, us, we just have a bunch of side projects that we try to create businesses out

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:29.820
of.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.980
I created a new side project, which was basically like a textbook rental service.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.360
Okay.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.200
And I built like a whole business model out of it and how I was going to do it.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.580
And then I built the site in Laravel and I used like Google API and all that stuff to

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.400
try to build this thing out.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.060
And I actually really liked Laravel.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.920
And then from there, I worked with Laravel more and more.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.620
And then finally I got a job locally working with Laravel at the company I work with now.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.080
And that's what I do right now.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.220
What are you doing day to day?

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:56.760
What kind of work?

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.160
Sounds like more web development.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.000
I continue web development right now.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.360
Day to day, I work for a wholesale military supply company.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.000
It's actually a pretty big company.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.720
It's like 150 person company.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.860
The web team is probably about like six strong.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.820
And we run this basically this multimillion dollar website that does all the wholesale

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.080
processing and all that.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:25.960
I also am in charge of a four person software development team that we're working on a large

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.940
scale ERP project to basically run this whole company.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.540
Yeah, cool.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.920
So I'm taking a lot of those concepts and trying to come home, apply them to Masonite.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.160
Yeah.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:34.720
Excellent.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.460
All right.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:35.600
Yeah.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.420
So let's dig into the Python web frameworks.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.960
So speaking of Masonite, if you go look at the usage stats, we've got

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.780
40% Django, 40% Flask, plus or minus a couple in there.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.560
A little bit down from there, we've got like Pyramid.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.860
I think it's like 6% was the last usage I saw there.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.600
You know, that rounds out a significant portion of what is Python and web frameworks.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.160
But like we talked at the opening, it used to be, well, Flask, Django, which are you?

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.920
It's kind of was the greeting or whatever amongst the Python web developers, right?

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.060
The last two or three years, there have been so many different frameworks.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:21.000
We have Jepronto, Sanic, Vibora, Starlet, FastAPI, Hug, Falcon.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.600
It's not even a super clear connection.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.940
API Star, for example.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.360
So there's Starlette and there's FastAPI.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.260
FastAPI?

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:30.920
Which one?

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:36.520
I think there's a handful of websites that actually use Starlette underneath.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.000
I think Responder from Kenneth Wright, for example, is one of those.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.920
So there's just, there's like this layering on of what people's different ideas of the Python

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.140
web world should look like.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.580
And how would you summarize that?

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.380
You know, is that looking at trying to make type hints do interesting things?

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.280
Is that async?

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.920
What are the trends that you're seeing in all of those or, you know, kind of in general there?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.800
So this is mildly controversial.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.800
And I actually argue a lot with like the people inside the community.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.660
Well, not argue, but, you know, debate a lot with people inside the community of the correct

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:14.340
answer is that the trend is moving towards asynchronous frameworks itself.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:20.140
Like the actual framework code is built around some kind of ASBee server or asynchronous server.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.520
That's the trend.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.320
I'm not entirely sure I agree with the trend because I feel like it forces a lot of people

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:34.200
that are new to all of this to sort of see the trend and sort of prematurely optimize their

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:34.680
application.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:40.000
So if their application is like a blog framework, for example, they're like, yeah, this blog framework,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.960
I mean, sorry, this blog application can handle 15,000 requests per second.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.420
But like, does it need to?

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.720
Does it really need to do that?

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.440
Like, I mean, that is really cool.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.380
And especially if you try to like load balance across two of these applications, like you can

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.720
handle like thousands and thousands of requests per second.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.760
But I feel like it's more of a premature optimization.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.480
Like if you want to use and then when they when they use these frameworks, like a lot of times

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:09.920
they have to start writing their code with the idea of it being also asynchronous as well.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.980
Like, you know, thread safe, I believe in this and all that stuff.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.900
And they can't just take any any ORM off the shelf.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.540
They have to use like an asynchronous compatible ORM.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.320
It basically narrows down a lot of your your decision making.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:29.660
And I'm not entirely sure if you need to create an API or something, some kind of small microservice,

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.520
just hit API endpoints, get information from a database.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.880
That's 100% the way to go.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.940
You need if you're creating a bunch of microservices, maybe for one monolithic application,

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.740
then that's 100% the way to go.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.340
But that's not the way I like to create my applications.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:43.800
Right.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.200
Yeah.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.040
So most people just want to create, you know, like a service like a like a SAS or something.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.420
It's an interesting point that you bring up.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:56.620
I would certainly say that there's a trend to see what the cool hot frameworks are doing

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:03.060
or what the amazing web companies are doing and try to emulate those way too early.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.460
Right.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.920
You know, you talked about these websites that you were creating.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.680
Like when you're, let's say you're creating your, if you're creating your, your textbook rental

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.200
company, you know, you're playing it like, well, we're going to have all the campuses around

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.180
America in September.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.020
They're all going back to school and getting their books.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.020
It's going to be crazy.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.980
And there's going to be all these orders.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:25.100
And it's just, you know, and the reality is probably one campus.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.460
If you were lucky joins in and it starts, you know, like it starts real slow.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:29.760
Right.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.940
And you've got all the, all the time in the world to see the analytics to, you know, you

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:40.340
scale your web server potentially, if you even have to like a standard web app, it can

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:47.020
take millions, millions of data-driven requests per month on like a $10 server before you have

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.500
to start worrying about all that stuff.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:53.440
It's definitely true that you can just not worry about it for a good long while.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.660
I mean, if you build your app poorly and it's super slow, then you're going to want those

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.300
features more.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:57.580
Right.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.040
But if you build it well, write indexes on your database and things like that, it should,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.700
it should fly.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.960
And it should be able to go quite a long ways until you have to worry about that.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.660
That certainly seems like a reasonable philosophy to me.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:13.680
The other one is, you know, I do training and write courses and do other presentations to

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.760
helping people learn things like web programming.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.320
And it's super overwhelming.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.980
As you know, I mean, you learned when you're young, so maybe it didn't feel as overwhelming.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.760
You just like, you just like, this is how computers are.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.440
This is what I do.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:24.640
Right.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.920
That's probably, that's probably right.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:32.140
But there's HTML, there's CSS, there's databases, there's query syntax, there's Python, there's

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.680
the templating language, there's Linux, there's deployment.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.160
I mean, there's just so many things, right?

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.620
And if you say, oh, by the way, why are you trying to learn all this for the first time?

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.580
You know, you need to learn asynchronous programming too.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.740
So don't forget about that.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.480
I mean, that's a tricky level.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.600
I feel like certainly that's, it's a really great thing to have for a web framework, but

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.080
it is not necessarily a great starting point.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.480
Right.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:52.880
Yeah.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.780
And that's what I would say on that.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.760
tool that you should reach for if you need it.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.960
But it's not something that you should default to just because it handles more requests per

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.220
second.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.620
That's my take on it.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:01.840
Cool.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.040
Yeah.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.300
So I do see like quite a number of those that I mentioned, like Starlette and Sanic and whatnot,

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.580
focusing FastAPI or whatever, focusing on this async aspect.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:22.900
But another aspect that I see being used a lot is things like type annotations and some of the other Python 3 features to try to make some of those features help with the web framework, for example.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.560
Does Masonite do any of that?

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.240
We'll probably talk about this when we get into the Masonite part.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:35.520
Masonite has something called an inversion of control container, an IOC container or a service container, which utilizes type hints.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.200
And the short answer, and we'll do the long answer later.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:47.640
The short answer is basically in the controller code and the controller method, you can type hint a class and Masonite will inject that class for you.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.040
Right.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:57.520
So like this controller takes a database derived class or whatever, and then you say that as a type hint, and then the IOC container will like push that in for you.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.380
Exactly right.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:58.580
Yeah.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.160
If you do like a sort of like a base class or something.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:09.860
So if it's an instance of a database base class, then inject the base class or the database driver that you have defaulted or something like that.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:10.080
Right.

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:10.920
What if you've registered?

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.180
Yeah.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.220
Okay, cool.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:12.500
Yeah.

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:12.860
Yeah.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:21.440
So I think this is kind of unique and new that so many of these like last couple of years frameworks have really tried to embrace Python 3, right?

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.480
Like Python 3 has been a struggle for Flask.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.880
They're not there anymore.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.940
But like for a while, they had a statement saying basically, we don't work on Python 3.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.480
Well, we probably work on Python 3, but we don't guarantee it.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.440
Something to that effect.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.020
Like four years ago or something like that's pretty rough statement given, you know, the date that it was.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:43.440
And then, you know, Django as well, just and 2.0 drop support for Python 2.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.720
So, you know, they've been kind of carrying that baggage around.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.060
They can't do things like this with their API, right?

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.900
If you fundamentally said you must have type-ins, well, you know, there goes your Python 2 support, right?

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:56.400
Straight away.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.560
So all these new ones, though, they seem to be coming along with like a fresh look.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.960
So I think that's pretty cool.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.680
Masonite, I noticed that a lot.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:13.520
So like it's pretty hard to support multiple versions of Python that don't work well with each other.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:18.220
So like, for example, 2.7 and 3.4, for example, to support both of those.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:28.140
So what I wanted to do with Masonite was one, yeah, start with Python 3, but also only default to the latest four versions of Python.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:34.940
So currently we support 3.4567 and 8's coming out soon.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.200
And so far the tests work for 8, so that's good.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.700
But when 8 comes out, we're going to drop support for 3.4.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.600
Yeah, that seems reasonable.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:49.480
Yeah, my philosophy basically is if you really need to create something in 3.4, then you're going to have to use Masonite 2.2.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.420
And if you want to use the latest, this way we can sort of keep up with the trends as it goes on.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:58.660
Yeah, well, for the moment, Python is released on an 18-month release cycle.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.840
So that gives you like six years of backwards compatibility.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.840
That should be enough.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.800
Right, exactly.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.000
That should be enough, I would think.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.060
There's actually a PEP out, I forget the number, by Lucas Lange, to move to yearly releases.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.920
But that would still be four years.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.480
That should be good.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.380
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.160
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Linode.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.880

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.060
Do you want a dedicated server for free for the next four months?

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.140
Just visit talkpython.fm/Linode.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.620
I'm really excited about all these web frameworks, Mason and I included.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.080
However, I have this new problem, right?

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.140
I could go and look and see Flash Django Pyramid.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.980
Let me compare those and sort of see the things I like or don't like about them.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:31.060
And then I can look at history and say, well, it's probably this much supported, so it's probably going to be about that much market share in the future.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.660
Flask is about 40%.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.900
There's a good chance Flask is going to be around next year.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.920
But I don't get that sense with these new frameworks, right?

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.740
Like, Responder was cool.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:47.320
I don't know if anything has even been done with Responder in the last, you know, little bit, right?

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.400
It seemed like not a whole lot had been going on with it.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.140
It took off in like the first like two months and then it sort of died out.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.040
Exactly.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.740
I mean, it is super cool and it's great that people are working with it.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:00.300
But how do you think about going through these frameworks?

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.240
I mean, obviously, you're just working on Masonite.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.540
So you're just, you know, going forward and keeping things going.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:09.900
But what would you say to people out there about how they should consider the stability of one of these projects?

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.920
Is this like a super cool one month idea or is this an actual thing?

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.760
Masonite itself?

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.100
Oh, yeah.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.160
It's definitely an actual thing.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.160
I always sort of think about what Masonite is going to like.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.660
Masonite is really, really cool now.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.440
But what is it going to look like in five years?

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.680
Like, what is that Masonite going to look like?

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.480
And I sort of work towards what that's going to look like.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.800
And then maybe in five years, I'll look for another five years and do the same thing.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:43.400
But basically, what I really like about the PHP ecosystem is that a lot of the time, these frameworks, like if you look at Symphony or Laravel, there's faces to them.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:58.500
There's people that you can, there's like leaders, you know, like even Django is sort of like, I don't know if it's just me, but it's sort of like this nameless, faceless organization type thing that like, like maybe like this Marvel type organization that like controls like Django.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:05.040
Like, I think it has like a committee and stuff, but there's not like one specific person that I know, like, oh, they own it or something like that.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.400
And like with Laravel, like the guy, Taylor Outwell, you know, he's all about Laravel and, you know, he works on it full time, obviously.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.320
But I can look at him and I could look at his future and tell the future of Laravel.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:20.660
So like me personally, like Masonite is going to be around for like a super, super long time.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:27.640
It's, this is basically, Masonite is going to turn into my side project that turns into like, you know, that business.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.980
Like for example, maybe that text, what that textbook rental service might've turned into.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.740
That's going to be what Masonite is.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:42.260
So, you know, once Masonite becomes profitable, either through sponsorships or partnerships or basically SaaS is around it, it'll just take off from there.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.660
But I mean, Masonite is going to be around for super long time.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.180
That's awesome.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:54.500
One of the metrics I use is when I go to these projects, obviously I look at how many stars does it have, but also, you know, maybe when was the last commit?

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.980
Is that three years ago or is that two days ago or an hour ago, right?

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.660
Like, what does that look like?

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:10.000
The other one is, probably the biggest one for me is open PRs that are not being addressed or barely are being addressed.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.980
That seems like a real big red flag to me, right?

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:19.880
If you go there and there's like five people who have put a bunch of work in to add some new features and they're just, all you got to do is just verify this is all right.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.420
And then just accept it and the people running the project can't even be bothered to respond to it.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:31.460
As a contributor, that's a crappy feeling, but also that's not a super good sign for the project, I don't think.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:31.980
That's right.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.200
Yeah.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:41.900
So the reason I bring this up is when I go to Masonite, there's zero open issues and there's zero open PRs, which is pretty cool.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.480
So here's like the weird thing with Masonite and maybe in future versions, this will be different.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.140
But Masonite is really broken up into two different repositories.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:59.020
So there's the Masonite repo that everybody goes to and they see has a thousand stars, but like people talked me into, actually, did people talk me into this?

00:23:59.020 --> 00:23:59.420
I'm not sure.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:06.720
But at one point I extracted all of the framework itself logic out and I just created an application.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:17.160
So people can basically, when people run their craft commands and they run craft new project and it creates this project down, it actually creates that, basically a copy of that repository down onto their computer.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.600
But if you look at, if you go to the Masonite organization and you go to the core repository, you can see the actual core code.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.580
That's the actual real code.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:24.840
Okay.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.400
Got it.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:25.700
Yeah.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.680
That's the actual, what's actually driving the Masonite application.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:40.020
Basically the Masonite that you see on the one with a thousand stars is basically just a shell of Masonite that I took all the, basically the framework code out and I made it in its own repository.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:44.800
And then I made that a package that the shell basically requires.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.340
So I basically, what I really wanted to do was take out as much.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:54.860
So when I first posted Masonite on Reddit, it was at like one version 1.3 and everybody hated it.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.820
And they said it was crap and it was dumb.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.680
You know, typical Reddit stuff.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:07.020
But the weird thing is that they were right because the original version of Masonite was like a basically one function that like did everything.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:14.160
So basically from there, I extracted all the logic out and I kept that repository up because I had so many stars already.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.900
I had like a hundred at the time or something.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:22.020
And I basically created a new package and tried to make it as modular as possible.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:22.280
Yeah.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.080
That makes a lot of sense.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:23.900
That sounds cool.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:30.420
Seems like there's at least activity on, you know, all the various items there, which is pretty cool.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:30.800
Right.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.360
It's not like three years ago.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.120
There's a lot of activity over there.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.720
Hanging out there.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.220
That's good.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:34.780
All right.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.540
So maybe we could dig into some of the features of Masonite.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:43.180
You talked a little bit about why you started it, but maybe give a little bit of clarity on that.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.180
And then let's just talk about some of its major features.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:49.140
Like why would people choose it over the other frameworks and what were some of the goals there?

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.500
So I needed a winter project because I was going, you know, in college.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.940
So I went to recess.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:59.280
I needed, you know, something to do because I'm home all day and programming is a passion.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.040
I can't just sit home and not do anything.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.900
So I need to code something and I didn't really have anything to do.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.720
So, and I was going through my year of learning frameworks.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.820
So I was like, you know what, let me learn how to, you know, build a framework.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:21.000
And so I looked up, you know, how to build a Python framework because that would be cool because the Laravel, I mean, the PHP ecosystem seems, was seemed to be too hard of a competition to penetrate.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.360
Yeah.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.420
And I saw a lot of holes that I tried to fill with Masonite in the Python community.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.820
So I thought it'd be good to build a Python framework.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:34.280
And getting a WSGI server takes like maybe seven minutes to set up and running and getting some kind of response.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.220
You're in some kind of dynamic response, which is probably why so many pop up.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:38.420
Right.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.000
So you're basically, there's like one function you implement.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.300
There's, they pass you the request and you return the response or something along those lines.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.100
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:46.420
Yeah.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:46.960
Yeah.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.620
It's just a, it's just a normal WSGI application that takes two variables and then you basically return.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.960
You use one to set the headers and then the other one to return the response.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.540
Super simple.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:00.880
So from there, I basically had it up and running and I was like, okay, well, I'm coming from Laravel.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:11.700
So I think it would probably be cool to write my routes in something I'm familiar with if I'm going to start building this framework because I don't want to learn something new even though I'm building it.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.200
So I took what I'm familiar with and I made the routes look like the modern day routes that they are now.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.280
And I added that feature in and I was like, oh, that's pretty cool.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.160
I mean, I wonder if I could add like controller logic too.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.560
Like that'd be, that'd be cool.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:30.680
And so I added the controller logic and the methods and, you know, swapping between different methods and calling certain classes.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.280
I was like, oh, that'd be cool.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.080
And I was like, what if I had something like super awesome, like, like built-in email sending support?

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.940
So like I built that in and then I tried to build it all modular.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.100
And I basically just went from there, like a little, little bit by a little bit.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:51.940
I just kept on putting more and more features in until just like out of nowhere, people started joining the community and like contributing actually.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:28:00.280
And we basically, we teamed up me and me and a couple of early adopters and we built into something really, really cool.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:06.400
And then we released 2.0 on June of 2018, I think.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.040
And then from there, it just shot up.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.800
It went from like 80 stars to like 500 in like a couple of days.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.080
Wow.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:12.480
That's cool.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:12.860
Yeah.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.000
Featured in the right places.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.740
A lot of people came to check it out, huh?

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.340
Yeah.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.540
I basically, I think I put it on Reddit and it got like 20,000 views in like three days.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:24.720
And it was on the top of our Python and it was on like Hacker News, I think.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:29.000
And it got like a whole bunch of, you know, tweets and stuff like that and people talking about it.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.640
And it basically shot up from there.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:30.880
Yeah.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.220
Super.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:37.100
You started out this conversation by talking about routes and the routing mechanism and controllers.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.260
So let's maybe dig into the code story around that a little bit.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:46.620
Now, talking about code in audio format is kind of not the easiest thing to do.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.840
But if we keep it simple enough, I think we can give people an idea.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.880
So it looks like you have some pretty interesting ideas around creating routes.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:02.000
And it looks like you are sort of embracing this HTTP verb type of world as well.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:02.380
Right?

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:07.080
So if I'm going to create some routes, I would go and create a, I would import a get.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.360
Is that a class that I'm creating?

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.380
Or is that a function I'm calling?

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.800
No, that's a class.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.240
A class.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:17.300
So I would create like a list of classes and I would say get like a forward slash.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.080
And then I would say welcome controller at show.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:27.080
So the welcome controller is a class that is handling this request and show is a method

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:27.720
within it.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.760
Or maybe welcome controller is just a module.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.240
I don't know.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.380
You could name it and so on.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:31.560
No, that's correct.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:31.920
Yep.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:32.320
Yeah.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.960
So I can create these gets and posts and it seems like a really nice way to build up

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.700
from sort of naturally understanding HTTP verbs and the way the internet and websites actually

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:42.920
work.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.760
Something early on in Mason, and really in my code in general, even when like I create my

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.800
method names, these method names are like, it seems like a whole sentence long.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.460
Because I like when I read my code, I like to read it in English.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:58.940
Like I like to read it from left to right as if I'm thinking it and I want to show it to

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:03.740
like a little kid almost and like have him understand it basically.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.880
Like it's just reading.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.020
It's like reading a book almost.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:09.340
So originally it was actually normally it's get.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.480
And then inside the get, you have the URL that you want to send to, like you said, and then

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.460
the controller method.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.420
But previously it was actually get.route.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:22.060
So when I read it, it was, I want to get route.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.660
And then I pass in the URL and stuff like that.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.860
And you can still do that actually.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:31.080
But we basically shortened it down to, yeah, just a list of get routes, post routes, option

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.360
routes, put routes, delete routes, stuff like that.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:33.900
That's super cool.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.660
How do you pass variables in through the URL here?

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.760
So I don't see any examples of that.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:47.420
Like if I do this show, I probably want to show like, you know, slash some blog post with

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.560
the URL or something like that.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:48.760
Yep.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.780
So in your URL, it would be, say you want to do like a slash blog post slash maybe one

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.780
or a two, or you want that to be a dynamic.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:56.100
Sure.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.000
That'd be, that'd be fine.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.280
It would be slash dashboard.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.360
And then you would do another slash and then an at symbol.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.160
And then the name of the variable that you want to retrieve later.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.880
So maybe it's blog ID.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.340
So it would be blog underscore ID.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.180
And then you'd put that there and then that's, that'll be the dynamic part.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:18.160
Or you can add sort of what I call regex compilers, which is basically, maybe I only want that

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:18.740
to be an int.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:23.260
So it would be at blog ID colon int int.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:29.380
So it'll only match integers or I could do strings or I could do some kind of super complex

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.440
one where I do like a website.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.680
And then I could actually pass a website in with slashes as well.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.220
And it'll actually match that as well.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:36.480
Yeah.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.100
You can do a lot of complex things with it.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.580
I love that, that simple way of doing constraints for types and stuff.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.140
Yeah.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:47.460
You create really nice things like on our website, you can say talkpython.fm/ two, three,

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.160
three, I think would be this episode, right?

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.460
If I got the number right.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:55.580
And that would actually only match for integers and then it'll go look that up and take you

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.560
to the real location.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:02.520
So it's like a really nice way to create short sort of CLI almost feels here.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:02.920
Web app.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.500
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.000
I try to write everything first.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.900
So I actually, when I created the routing engine, I actually wrote down, I don't know,

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.320
piece of paper, every single variation I could possibly write for a routing engine.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.020
And then I basically crossed out all the crappy ones that I thought looked ugly.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.720
And I only went with the one that looked nice.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.920
And then I worked backwards to the actual implementation.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.180
Like I had no idea how I was going to create this thing.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.860
But then I worked backwards to actually creating the class and creating all that stuff.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.780
That's how I actually write almost everything.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.920
I want to use it this way.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.240
I don't really know how.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:32.460
Right.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.820
We're going to make this happen somehow.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.700
That's cool.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.640
The other thing that you have here is you have classes.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.620
And the classes like capture the request object.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.320
And then you have the methods that run for the view.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.600
And I actually really like this pattern.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.040
I use this pattern in some of my websites as well, even though I have to kind of fight

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.040
against the grain a tad bit to make it happen.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.140
I really like it.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.020
And you have the word controller.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:59.700
Do you consider Masonite a model view controller framework, a model view template?

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.400
I don't really even understand why there's a distinction between those things.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.640
But it seems to be in the Python space there is.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.480
So I do consider Masonite an MVC.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.500
But it's not.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.820
I try to make it not constrained to just control logic.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:18.000
So I try to sort of assist the developer who's working with Masonite to sort of take a lot

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.180
of that logic and add, you know, extract it into like maybe like a mail class, which is

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.060
ejected into the controller and stuff like that.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:31.080
So it's not a strict MVC, but it does use basically the wording to sort of help you

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:31.760
structure your code.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.380
I like that pattern.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:32.720
It's cool.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.880
You talked about the injection stuff and I do want to cover that.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.140
That's fairly unique in the Python space.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:45.120
But before we get there, so the way that I would, if I was a Masonite developer and I

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.060
was starting a new web app based on it, I would create a virtual environment and I would pip

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.320
install some stuff, Masonite and whatnot, right?

00:33:51.320 --> 00:34:00.940
And then I would start issuing command line or CLI behavior commands to Masonite to help scaffold

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.940
build up and start building my app.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.260
So you could say you have this utility called craft.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.660
Tell us about craft and some of the commands and what's the story on that?

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:10.880
I think it's incredible, actually.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.840
I think that's actually what makes or breaks the framework.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.920
So craft commands.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.320
So think of like Django, because a lot of your listeners are probably familiar with Django.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:26.920
So in Django, you might have a class based view and you might have that, you know, return a couple of templates, maybe some kind of context and stuff like that.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.600
And then you want to create another one.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:37.040
We usually end up doing is you either maybe create a new file and then instead of creating the whole class, you probably sort of copy and paste that old one that you already created into the new one.

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.240
Yeah, certainly a copy and a paste is a solid start.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.440
So what craft does is it gets rid of all of that boilerplate.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:54.160
So in Masonite, if you want to create a new controller with, you know, a couple of imports and you want to import the request class, the view class, you want to create a method.

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.820
What you do is you do craft controller and the controller name.

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.580
So maybe craft controller blog.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.220
And it'll actually create you a blog controller.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.900
It imports the request class, it imports the view class.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:10.040
It makes a default show method and it type hints the view class and it type hints the request class.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.860
Like it creates all that boilerplate for you.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.000
And it does the same thing.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.780
Like if I want to create a middleware, craft controller middleware, it creates me a class, imports everything I need.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.120
What's an example of middleware?

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.220
Like why would we, why would I create one of these things?

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:21.720
What does it do?

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.200
A middleware?

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:22.440
Yeah.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.720
In the Masonite terminology.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:33.900
So a middleware is basically a piece of functionality or code that runs in between the request class or in between the incoming request and your controller method.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.620
So for example, maybe you want to have some kind of authentication.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:41.380
So if the user is not logged in, I don't even want to hit the controller.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.060
I just want to redirect to the login page.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.480
So I might create that.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.600
Or maybe I want to create some kind of after middleware.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:53.020
Like I want to take the HTML response and maybe minify it and then return it.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.120
Something like that.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:36:02.360
So you create these middleware that run in between your controller, in between the incoming request in the controller, and then in between the controller and the final response.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.000
And you sort of inject these things.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.440
That's actually really, really simple to work with, with Masonite.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.580
But yeah, you just use these craft commands.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.900
You can create, you know, migrations.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.980
You can create jobs.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.140
You can create listeners and tasks.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.180
And you create all these things, all this boilerplate.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:23.500
So the objective really is that I don't want to focus on writing things that aren't crucial to my application.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.180
So if I have a thought that says, all right, I need to start sending out an email.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.960
Let me make a new controller or something like that.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.360
I just create the controller and I go to the controller and I'm still focused on sending out my email.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.780
I drop down to the method and I start coding, sending out my email.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.460
Like I never break my train of thought with what I actually need to do to get my business logic set up.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:43.780
That's cool.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.240
And it seems like it follows some really nice conventions.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.520
So for example, you said maybe we want to create a blog controller as a show method.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:59.440
So you would say craft controller blog, but it actually creates the controller, a controller class called blog controller, not just blog.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:06.300
It puts it in slash app slash HTTP slash controllers, and it initializes it all correctly, right?

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:12.960
It has an initializer, which has a type, you know, request object that has a type annotation of requests and things like that.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.540
Yep, exactly.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:18.280
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Datadog.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:25.600
Datadog is a monitoring and analytics platform that unifies metrics, logs, and distributed traces from your Python applications.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:32.860
Datadog's tracing client auto instruments popular frameworks and libraries such as Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, and AsyncIO,

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.680
so you can quickly get deep visibility into your applications.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.380
Trace requests across service boundaries, correlate traces with logs and metrics,

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.220
and plot your application architecture with the service map.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.580

00:37:52.220 --> 00:38:00.680
Yeah, one of my pet peeves around some of these projects is they give you zero guidance about any organization.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:08.580
And maybe even taking it farther, like sometimes they even accentuate their ability to not have any organization or any structure.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.700
Like, look, you don't even need that.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.280
Look, you don't even need one file.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.500
Just like put it in this file, and you're good.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.520
This is where it goes.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.660
It all just goes in here.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.320
And like, no, it doesn't all go in there.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:23.080
You're going to have, you know, so many view files or controller files.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.880
You have, you know, 50 templates.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.220
Like, you need organization.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:35.000
And this, like, selling the lack of it as simplification seems to me like pushing at least beginners down, like, the wrong path.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.240
Right?

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:43.100
So I like that your craft commands take, like, a natural structure and just say, this is the convention we use, and we're just putting it here.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:43.780
Right, exactly.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.860
And like you said, it creates that file, and then it puts that controller in it.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.500
But it's only that one class.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.780
And that is opinionated.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:58.940
That is the way I like to work, mainly because in my VS Code editor, if I need to go to my authentication middleware.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:07.520
In order to do that, you know, I hit the command P thing, and I go to authentication middleware, and I click enter, and I go to that specific class, that specific method.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:14.960
I'm not, like, going into, like, some kind of middleware.py file, scrolling down a couple hundred lines so I could find that middleware class or anything like that.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.340
Yeah, yeah.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.520
So it's just the way I code.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.860
I just hop around files, you know, all day until my app is done.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.600
Man, I'm with you.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.140
I love it.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.080
That's the way to do it.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:28.200
Having, like, these huge long files with everything crammed in there, it just means it's so hard to find.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:34.560
I think the choice of editor somewhat influences the granularity of, that you're comfortable with here.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.480
But I'm kind of, it sounds like you and I would have a similar style.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.180
Yeah, exactly.

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:44.180
Like, I feel like it's almost like when you give a kid, like, a guitar, and he grows up to be a rock star.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:49.780
Like, whatever sound that guitar made is probably what kind of rock he's going to play, you know?

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.220
So, like, it's almost like that.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.480
Like, whatever editor you use probably dictates what kind of applications you're going to build.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.040
Right, right.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.600
Something like VS Code is very natural at handling many directories, many files, and, like, seeking between them really quickly.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.780
Right.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:07.800
The other thing that you talked about when you talked about that flow there was injecting things.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:16.780
Now, I definitely think dependency injection and the open-close principle and all those things have some really interesting places in the Python world.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.400
But I also don't see them used very often.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:24.580
So, this is kind of a unique aspect of it, of what you're doing.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:31.680
But so, for example, like, if I've got my show method from my blog, and maybe in order to get my blog, I have to go to my database.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.420
And I want to work with MongoDB.

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:43.300
So, somewhere previously at the app startup, I said, when I asked for a database, give me the MongoDB implementation of my repository thing or my database service or whatever I called it.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:43.480
Right.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:55.580
So, I can go to that view method and say, you know, like, show self, comma, view, colon, view, comma, DB, colon, repository or database class or database service.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:00.880
And then I'll just automatically just start getting my database instance passed into me by Masonite.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.180
Yep.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:01.980
That's exactly right.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:11.160
Or what you can really do, where Masonite really shines is being able to basically swap out what I call interfaces or contracts.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:18.480
So, like one of the other principles, interface segregation principle, right, where you want to really code to an interface and not to a concretion.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.860
Yeah, we can hit all the solid principles.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.560
Right.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:20.820
Yep.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.800
So, what you can do is you can, Python doesn't have like an implements keyword or anything.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:33.220
But if you have like a base class, say you have a, what would be a good example, like a payment base class, you can type in that.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.260
Yeah, payment service, whatever.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:34.480
Sure.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:34.800
Right.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.540
Yeah, payment service.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.300
So, you type in payment service.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:44.840
And even though you have no classes called payment service, it'll find an instance of payment service and return that as well.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.060
Right.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:50.900
Maybe you wrote a class called Stripe payment service and it drives from payment service and it actually talks to the Stripe API or something like that.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.380
And it'll just find that and inject it.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:52.700
Yeah, exactly.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:42:09.800
And what's even better, I think, is that, and this might sound confusing to people who don't understand IOC, but what also it does is when it resolves that payment service class, it'll resolve whatever is in the initializer of the payment service class as well.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:22.640
So, basically ties every single class that that payment service relies on, ties it all together, initializes everything, and then returns everything as an object already set.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:33.180
So, you don't know longer do you have to sort of import a class, maybe get some config variables, maybe pass it in, construct that thing, and then pass that thing into something else that needs it.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.340
Everything just ties together sort of seamlessly.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.100
And then you can also swap out functionality as well.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.200
That's really what powers an IOC container.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:48.900
And the funny thing with Python and IOC is that even if you Google, why doesn't Python have an IOC implementation or something like that?

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.300
I forget the Google question.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.220
But you go there and it says, you don't need an IOC container.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:58.180
I think it's like because Python is like duct typed or something.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.960
Like it was, it almost like made no sense.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:05.720
Like, like that's not really the reason for an IOC or anything like that, or even for like interfaces or anything.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.200
So, it was very strange.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:14.480
But I think IOC is more of a architectural decision that just, you have to build applications.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.020
Like we're building this large scale ERP system at work.

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:21.300
There's probably going to be a two-year long project, probably thousands and thousands of classes.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:27.000
And like if you didn't have an IOC, like how do you manage all those dependencies between the classes?

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.780
Like it's crazy.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:28.460
It gets tricky.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.540
That's for sure.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:34.960
I would say for sure that Python does not, as a general rule,

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:39.880
the people in the community and the libraries don't generally embrace IOC.

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.260
But yeah, I see it being really useful here.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.440
So, that makes a lot of sense.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:49.020
You know, like your payment service, your Stripe one also takes a logging framework or logging service.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.700
And it takes a database service or something like that, right?

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:56.220
Like you just register them all and it all just, you just go to your view and say it takes a payment service

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.780
and you get the Stripe service all set up.

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:01.060
As long as they're all in the container, they all can communicate with each other.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:01.500
That's cool.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.860
And probably use that for testing as well, right?

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:10.760
Like you could swap out the database with like a mock database and the logging with like a null logger

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.580
that actually doesn't do anything or something like that.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:13.540
Like prints.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:17.500
Even Masonite itself is strictly based around this container.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.940
So, if you want to change out the request class, for example,

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.800
and you want to make it a different request class, you could just do that.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.460
And everything else will sort of follow.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.920
As long as you follow the contract of the class,

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:31.340
you could just sort of swap every single piece of functionality out of Masonite and inject your own.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:31.680
That's cool.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:37.820
One of the challenges I've had when working with IOC is I'll be somewhere in the middle of the system

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.720
and I'll have all these dependencies that were put together by the IOC container.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:47.280
And I'll be like, all right, I have no idea what actual database I have or what logging thing I have

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.880
or where it came from or any of that.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:54.600
And I do see that as one of the drawbacks of IOC is it's kind of hard to see where it all gets started.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:59.920
Yeah, I mean, I guess if you sort of lose yourself, then I guess you're sort of lost, I guess.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.460
But as long as you have like a good file structure and you have like maybe good documentation on your project

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.200
and stuff like that, you can sort of, there are caveats, I'll admit.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.140
But it's definitely a pretty good architecture.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:12.520
Yeah.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.360
One of the things I like about your craft commands is, you know, I'm a fan of things like cookie cutter.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.300
And I think cookie cutter is a super way to get started, right?

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:25.720
Like the right way is not create an empty .py file and start typing it.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:30.540
I don't think like, you know, I already talked about the structure, but there's also tons of static files.

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:37.120
There's just, there's a lot of stuff that would be nice if you could start farther from let's enter character one and get going, right?

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.820
And I think cookie cutter is a nice way to do that, right?

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:44.440
You could say, okay, I'm going to use, I'm going to create a flash project that's already using SQLAlchemy.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.960
So it's got the requirements set up.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.560
It's already got a database structure.

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:52.200
It's already got a connection string for SQLite database for getting started and, you know, that kind of stuff, right?

00:45:52.200 --> 00:46:00.940
What falls apart with a lot of those systems is you get to run them once and that's it.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:01.280
Right.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:01.440
Right.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:02.560
Like I have a super cool.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.460
I was just about to say that.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:03.700
Yeah.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:09.760
I have a cool cookie cutter template that will actually generate the final code from this course I have called Python for Entrepreneurs.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.140
And it's like super involved.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:16.000
There's so much stuff going on and you can type in the name of your project and whatever and run the cookie cutter.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:24.820
And it will just, boom, out drops this really well formed project that looks just like the final project of that course, but with your data in it, right?

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:30.500
The problem is that's great for getting my first controller or whatever is in there.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.940
But if I want the second one, cookie cutter is not going to help me.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.620
That's where copy and paste comes in, right?

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:43.320
It seems like with your craft commands, you can start out building pieces of your app and continue kind of adding to the app with that CLI.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.100
What do you think?

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:44.600
Yeah, exactly.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:51.180
I mean, every, when you're trying to reach for like a copy and paste, like you're wasting so much time.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:57.300
And not only are you wasting time, but you're, now that you finally copied and pasted it, now you have to be like, all right, wait, what was I trying to do again?

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.060
Oh yeah, right.

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:58.260
Okay.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:58.420
Yeah.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:58.860
Sending email.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:01.900
And then you sort of go back into sending email and it takes your mind off.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:05.240
And it's just, it's just a massive like time suck.

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:18.260
And most people that use Masonite, I don't know about most people, but a lot of people that are in the Slack channel, they say, man, like I built this thing in Masonite in three days.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.980
It would have taken me three weeks in Django.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.760
So I actually get that a lot.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:25.700
It sort of gets to the point where I almost expect it when someone comes from Django or something.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.400
I just, I basically just wait for it.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:32.660
And I think a lot of that is because all of that boilerplate code is done for you.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:38.800
Like we already created controllers and if you need to create a job, you create a job, you add your logic and then you just add it to a queue.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.420
Like it's takes five seconds.

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:41.340
Yeah.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:41.800
It's huge.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.060
Yeah.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:42.420
That's cool.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.980
So let's talk about some of the other things that you can make with these craft commands.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.360
You just talked about jobs.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.960
That sounds like an asynchronous thing.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.620
Maybe kicking out to some kind of background worker process.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:58.760
You talked about email before we've got views and templates and create templates.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.700
So you've adopted the Jinja 2 template system.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:02.060
Is that right?

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:02.480
Yes.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:02.800
Yeah.

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.200
Do you have any other support like chameleon?

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.180
Hint, hint, chameleon?

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.540
I don't currently.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:11.580
I know that one guy came to me and he said he wanted to write in pug.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.060
I don't know if you ever heard of pug before.

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.400
No, I only know it as a dog.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.900
Yeah, I think it's called, oh no, maybe I just kept on calling it pug, but maybe a pub or something.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.360
But anyway, it's basically, it looks like a markdown type style.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.560
And he wanted to write in that and it had a Jinja 2 extension.

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.480
And then from there, I basically added extension support for the views and stuff.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:36.220
So you could write, you could basically write in any Jinja 2 extension language.

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.980
So it basically just compiles down into Jinja, I guess, and then gets rendered.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:44.740
But as for swapping out that functionality for chameleon, it's possible.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.040
But there's no documented way of doing it.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:47.260
Sure.

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.000
But it definitely could be.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.700
You could open an issue.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.580
VRs are accepted, huh?

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.360
Yeah, of course.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:51.700
Nice.

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:52.760
Background work.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.300
Let's touch on that real quick.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.880
That's not something every framework decides to take on for itself.

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.700
Yeah, definitely.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:03.740
So a lot of the features of Masonite came by me needing it.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:11.060
So basically, I'll basically add it to my application and then I'll try to extract it into a framework feature.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:16.080
And one of the things I needed was sending an email and I wanted to send that asynchronously.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:19.720
So I created the concept of queues and jobs.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:26.140
So a job is basically just a normal, simple class that extends queueable.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.920
And you can add your logic of sending an email.

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.000
Maybe it'll accept a parameter of an email.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.120
And then you could take that job and then you could pass it into any queue driver that you want.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.300
So if we want to run it asynchronously, we pass it in the asynchronous queue driver.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.540
If we want to...

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.860
And then when I deployed to Heroku, I didn't want to run things asynchronously.

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:50.420
I wanted to run things through some kind of RabbitMQ server.

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.720
So I coded that driver.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:59.580
And the cool thing is that in order to create a new driver, it's just a simple class that needs four methods.

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:05.640
And then you take that and you register it to the container and then you have that functionality.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:10.600
So I created the AMQP driver, which is the protocol for RabbitMQ.

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.340
It took like maybe a night.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:16.000
And then actually last night, I actually created a database driver as well.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.060
So now you could take that same job, that email job, adds it to a database table.

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:30.160
You have a worker that you run as like a separate process, maybe on like a supervisor process, that will basically pull that database and then run the job.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.540
And the cool thing about that is that you can actually delay queue jobs as well.

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.420
So you can delay it by 10 minutes.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:39.460
Maybe after the user signs up, we'll send a welcome email in 10 minutes.

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:45.200
And then you add that and it'll basically, you know, wait 10 minutes and then it'll send the email out.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:50.720
And that's the way I like to sort of counter the ASGII competition.

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.000
So, you know, going to the next page might take one second or a half a second.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.520
But sending that email might take two seconds.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:01.100
But if you send it to a queue job, you know, it only takes that half a second.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:04.660
And then it'll just run in the background or in your queue server or something like that.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.640
So I thought that was a really cool feature that I added in Masonite pretty early.

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.160
And I use it all the time.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:09.620
That's cool.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:16.660
Certainly, asynchronous queues and background work like that do solve a lot of the primary reasons that you need.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.000
Some sort of direct async behavior.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:25.960
I do think the database stuff, if you could have it as async, once you, and we talked about it not necessarily being a great place to start.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.380
But once you get advanced, like it would be kind of cool.

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:31.040
But, you know, my sites don't have it either, right?

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:36.940
Like both my database access layer can't support it, nor does the framework support it.

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.460
And, you know, the thing is super, super fast.

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:43.560
Like, honestly, I don't understand why most websites that I work with are so crappy and slow.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.540
Because I didn't work that hard to get mine to go fast.

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:48.640
Right.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.480
It doesn't do that hard.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.120
Anyway.

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:57.440
But I bet you if it was simple enough, like if you just had to create a job and then add it to the queue, which is already created for you, I bet you probably would do it.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:01.700
Like creating some kind of queue background work, like a lot of Django projects probably don't.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:08.800
I did end up creating this type of thing because certain types of operations might send thousands of emails on the click of a button.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.400
And you can't wait for that to happen.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:10.660
Right.

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.680
It's insane.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.020
Right.

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:17.320
For example, if I like I have office hours for my courses that people can come, they take the course, they get the office hours for free.

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.320
A bunch of people signed up for those.

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:19.780
Right.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:24.620
If I enter a new one, I can't just wait to send all those emails because it'll time out.

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.080
But other things like putting people on mailing lists.

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:27.400
Right.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.940
They signed up for the site.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:33.420
They said, OK, you can put me on your mailing list, but they don't need to wait for you to put them on the mail.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.540
There's no outcome from that that they need anything from.

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.020
Right.

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:37.380
Exactly.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:37.820
Right.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:40.300
So that's a perfect example of some kind of background work.

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:46.620
And adding background work to Masonite literally takes about maybe 10 seconds of code once you get comfortable with it.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:54.920
I tried to make every single thing as easy, as quick as possible, just to make it like this rapid application development tool that people reach for.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.160
Yeah.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:55.400
Cool.

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.880
One of the things that Django comes with is Django ORM.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.400
And that's been really popular.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:08.660
One of the things that Flask and Pyramid have eschewed, they've decided we're staying far away from, is defining a database access layer at all.

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.800
And it's like up to you.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:16.660
Typically, the answer is go get Sequel Alchemy or something like Mongo Engine if you're going to talk to MongoDB or something else.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:16.840
Right.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:17.780
But it's up to you.

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.940
There's no guidance.

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:28.540
It sounds to me like with Masonite, you decided to bring along an ORM, an active record style one, which matches really well with Django ORM.

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:28.920
Right.

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:32.460
And its style, not so much with Sequel Alchemy, which is a unit of work type of one.

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.880
Why not just lean on Sequel Alchemy?

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.680
So again, it was what I wanted it to look like.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.220
So I wanted the ORM to look like something I was comfortable with using.

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.680
And again, Masonite is sort of like a framework for me, right?

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.960
Like I knew I was going to use it.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.060
I didn't want to build it for somebody else.

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:49.740
I used it.

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:51.800
So I built it in a way that I would like it.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.780
And I came from Laravel, like I said.

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.900
And Laravel has something called an Eloquent ORM, which is another active record style.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:02.780
And then I found Orator, which is pretty feature complete.

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.440
There's a couple of things that can be added to it.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.480
And it was basically influenced by Eloquent.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.920
So it was almost like perfect to bring in because it's super sleek.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.300
You don't have to like do anything crazy.

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.760
Like getting all records is like the model name dot all.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.480
That's it.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.140
That's all you have to do.

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.240
Getting like where is like dot where.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.860
And then, you know, you can maybe change some where's together.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.340
To get the first record is, you know, dot first.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.680
Like it's very, very sleek.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:31.680
And I thought that was the same as Masonite's philosophy of doing something as quick as possible

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.400
to get what I need done.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:38.100
And it also had the, what I wanted to do as well was the migrations.

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.560
So the migrations are really important.

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:44.200
So in Django, you have like these magic migrations that are basically, I don't even know how,

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.740
but they're somehow like taken from like model changes.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:51.980
And it basically generates these things that run that you should like never edit because

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:53.380
that's probably bad.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.040
And it's probably going to screw up something down the road.

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.360
Something will get out of sync.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:56.780
Yeah.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:00.280
In Laravel and in Orator, you want to do the migrations.

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.680
The migrations are much more explicit.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:08.420
So what you're doing is you generate as this new migration and you, you know, add a couple

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:12.520
of table columns and there's like an up method and a down method.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:17.220
And the down method just reverses what you did in the up method, which is usually defaulted

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:21.320
to like a sensible default, like dropping the table, which is usually what you need to do.

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.000
And that's what I wanted.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.660
And then Orator also had that too.

00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:27.380
So that saved like a whole lot of time.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:31.760
So it just made sense to go with Orator and I used it and I integrated the migrations

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:32.740
process with it.

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.760
And I just really, really like Orator.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.920
I think it's a really great ORM.

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:40.480
So then I just incorporated it and everybody else seems to like it.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.660
So I guess something's good.

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:42.440
It looks pretty interesting.

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:49.560
I can certainly see how it goes with your philosophy of, you know, I wanted to look like this.

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:50.420
How do I make that happen?

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:50.840
Right.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:56.640
It's a little bit, a little bit SQLAlchemy-esque in some ways, but not in others, right?

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.060
Like the way you define the model and the table names and stuff.

00:55:59.060 --> 00:55:59.800
That's pretty cool.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:05.480
One of the things I like about some of your philosophies or styles here is you could go

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.260
and say, get a user.

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:11.620
You could say user.find and pass a user ID and that'll give you back the user or maybe none,

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:11.860
right?

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:12.680
Yeah, it's nice and quick.

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:17.520
Or you could say user.find or fail and give the user ID and you either get one back or I'm

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.580
guessing you get an exception if that didn't work, right?

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:19.840
Yep.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:20.100
Yeah.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.420
So what I'm using, say SQLAlchemy, SQLAlchemy has a first and it has a one.

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.580
Which one of those?

00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:30.040
He's going to throw an exception when it doesn't find it.

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:35.720
You know, I mean, probably one, but is one just the way I get the first one or is first

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:36.820
the way I get the first one?

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:37.420
You know what I mean?

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:39.520
There's just, it's just a little less.

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.480
It's very fluent.

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.620
Order is very fluent.

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:43.380
Obviously, once you get used to it, right?

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.080
First just gives you the first or none and so on.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:49.440
But this name is super clear and I really like the style of find or fail.

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:53.140
Because like I said, like when I write my code, I didn't write order.

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:56.460
I'll admit it was already written for me, you know, written, almost written for me.

00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:01.000
I felt like, but it reads like English and that's how I like to do it as well.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:01.320
Yeah.

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:05.960
You also have an interesting way of setting up relationships with decorators and properties.

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.120
How does that work?

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:07.280
Oh yeah.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.460
So I think this is, this is actually really cool.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:19.220
So in order, if you have a user and in articles, a user has many articles and then in

00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:20.720
article belongs to a user.

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:26.380
So what you can do is when you do like maybe user equals user.find1 and you get your user,

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:28.340
you could do user.articles.

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:30.700
And this is called a dynamic property.

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:36.440
Even though you created a method called articles and you decorated it with a has many relationship,

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.000
you fetch it by using this dynamic property.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:39.260
Right.

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.980
It basically is similar to the app property syntax.

00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:46.180
And it actually returns a collection of all the, all the articles.

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:54.600
Or what you could do is if maybe a user has one profile, which has one address, which has

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.620
one something else.

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:59.460
You could actually, when you fetch your user, you could do user.address.

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.060
Or user.profile.address.

00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:04.300
And you could just keep on chaining these relationships.

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:07.460
And then eventually you get down to what you need.

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:14.120
Or what you do is you do user with profile address, something else.

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.800
And then you actually, what do you call eager load?

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.700
And that gets rid of the N plus one problem.

00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:21.640
That's a big problem with ORMs.

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:26.560
And I think some people don't know what that is, what the N plus one problem is.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:29.100
You want to take a shot at describing that for the audience?

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:35.100
Because personally, I am a huge fan of ORMs or in the manga world, ODMs for documents.

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.600
But these classes that map back to your data, I think it's a huge benefit.

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:41.820
But this is one of the problems that you need to be aware of.

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.420
And it can be one of the performance problems.

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:46.140
So maybe tell people about this N plus one problem in ORMs.

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:49.400
So let's say you get a list of 50 users.

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.380
And you want to loop through all those 50 users.

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:56.100
And you want to get the profile of each user, right?

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:59.700
Because that first one where you get the list, that's probably a single query, right?

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:03.980
Users.find state equals California or something like that, right?

00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:04.920
And you get 50 results.

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:05.820
So there's your one.

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:07.400
There's your one in the N plus one.

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:07.800
Right.

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.180
I'll explain the problem first and then I'll explain the solution.

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:15.820
So the problem is if I loop through the user and I did user.profile, it's going to create

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:21.080
or it's going to fire a query for each time I use user.profile.

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.380
And it's going to fire a query.

00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.740
So that's where the N comes in because you're looping through all 50.

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.820
Now you have 50 plus one queries.

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.660
And now you have 51 queries.

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:30.100
Probably slow to do that, right?

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.320
It's probably not good to do 51 queries when you could do one.

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:33.640
Right.

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:40.780
So what you do is you do user with profile find one and that eager loads, which called.

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:42.240
So that's two queries.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:48.800
And what that does is it gets the user ID and then it does a where in on the other table.

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:53.600
And it basically saves that information basically in memory on that object.

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:58.780
So now whenever I do user.address, I already loaded that information.

00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:02.760
So I just fetch it from some kind of dictionary or something or some kind of collection saved

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.540
on that user object.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.940
So now it's only ever two queries that I'm doing it.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.440
So it gets rid of that N plus one problem.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.400
Yeah, that's perfect.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:13.060
And it's super easy to tell if you just turn on logging, right?

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:17.640
You could tell you have an N plus one problem because you're like, whoa, why is, if you turn

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.740
on logging to like every time you do a query, you show me what's happening going to the

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:25.740
database, you're like, I hit this one page and there's like 20 queries.

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.740
Why this should be one or two?

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.500
What is happening, right?

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.120
That's probably an N plus one problem.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:36.520
Yeah, I've gotten about 750 queries down to like 13 or something like that using like the

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.100
with statements.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.640
Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.300
That's pretty sweet.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:44.080
All right, Joe, I think we're getting long on time here, but this has been really fun.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:50.180
It's clearly an opinionated framework, but I also like that you can use these craft

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.920
commands to kind of bring in bits and pieces as you want to or not.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.720
That's cool.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.360
Yeah, thank you.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:55.800
Yeah, you bet.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.860
All right.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:02.280
So let me just ask you one really quick question, I guess, around the project itself before we

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:02.840
move off of it.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.480
So are you looking for contributors?

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.400
People do like take it for a run?

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.840
People to add issues, add PRs?

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.580
Where's it at?

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.960
Yeah, I mean, we're looking for contributors all the time.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:19.060
I mean, you could be a contributor by joining the Slack channel and saying like, hey, you

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:19.860
should have this feature.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:24.380
And then I'll probably, you know, either code it that night or maybe a couple days later or

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:24.840
that weekend.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.520
That's even contributing.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.160
I mean, you didn't code, but you still contributed towards the development of the framework.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.920
And Masonite's in a really unique position because it sort of is opinionated and it is

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.580
a Python framework.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:38.260
So it has a lot of people coming in from different ecosystems.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.940
Like people feel really comfortable coming from Ruby.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.360
People feel really comfortable coming from Laravel.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.240
People love it coming from Django.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.560
So when they come in, they have all these like really, really unique ideas.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.560
So if you're not even in the Python community, I mean, that's, I think that's even better coming

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.520
in because you're coming with fresh ideas that maybe people from the Python community don't

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.800
have yet or haven't seen.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:03.800
So yeah, just joining the Slack channel is huge to come in.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.780
If you know how to code or you go to a Python, that's great too.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:07.600
Yeah, that's cool.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.640
How old is Masonite?

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.560
So Masonite was developed, it started December of 2017.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:19.600
And then in six months later, we came out with the main release, which was June of 2018.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.680
So it's probably about, what is that?

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:26.980
Probably really only a year and a half old is really when it really started kicking off.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.180
Cool.

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:31.860
The reason I ask is a lot of these other web projects in the Python space are very old,

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.240
right?

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.620
They, they've been around since 2005 or 2008 or something like that.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:41.700
And as a contributor, if you want to participate in that, you're walking up to a highly polished,

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:46.780
careful, delicate balance of features and things and so many people depending upon it.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:50.640
And if you want to make a change, it can be really hard to do minor things, right?

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.420
So these newer frameworks, I feel are maybe better opportunities for folks to contribute

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.960
because it's somewhat newer, right?

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:01.860
And it's a little more dynamic and flexible and it's not so set in stone.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.620
Yeah, I think that's exactly right.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.580
And even the Masonite code in general is super, super clean.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:12.820
Almost every single method is, has doc strings that explain and where each variable comes from

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:13.320
and stuff like that.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.080
So it's really, really easy to contribute.

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:22.060
And since it's fairly new, although it has like a crap ton of features and people actually like are really,

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:26.560
really impressed that it's only, you know, a year and a half old and it has dozens and dozens of features.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.880
There's a lot of easy picking still that can be coded up.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:36.840
So there's even in the issues, I usually put good first issue or I list a difficulty, easy, medium, hard.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:41.160
I haven't done that actually with the latest issues, but normally I do that.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.400
So if you want to hop in and see what kind of difficulty you're at and then go there.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.740
Yeah, you can decide, oh, actually, this might be more than I want to spend to get started in this.

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:57.480
The other thing that is interesting and I noticed about your project is you're participating in the GitHub sponsor program.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:04.920
I don't know if that's the right name for it, but it's something to that effect where folks can contribute through GitHub to Masonite, right?

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:05.940
Tell people about that.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:11.220
So I think with that button that you see, that little sponsor button, it's really, I think it is called the GitHub sponsor button,

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.960
but it's really just a list of other links.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:23.040
It's really just a button and then you could post links to like a Patreon or some kind of like patronage service.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:29.220
So it's not anything crazy, but if you click on it, it'll show you the link to the Patreon page where you can either sign up to be a contributor.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:35.320
If you're a company and you want to sponsor, the documentation page gets, I think, around 10,000 page views a month.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.700
So if you want to go there, it's always good to contribute there as well.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:40.100
Very cool.

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.600
All right.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.400
Well, let me ask you the two questions before I let you get out of here.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.400
Now, I think astute listeners will already know the answer to this question, but that's okay.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.980
I think we kind of touched on it already.

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.280
But if you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:54.760
VS Code.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.180
Yeah.

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.300
That's a good one.

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.560
That's definitely got a lot of momentum behind it right now.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:58.960
Yeah.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:05.540
And then notable PyPI package that maybe you ran across or maybe Masonite depends upon.

01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:06.480
You're like, this thing is awesome.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.840
It doesn't get enough attention.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.820
Maybe tell people about something like that.

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:13.600
Like, first of all, just to get out of the way, you can pip install Masonite as a thing, right?

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.160
Yeah.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.580
So there's one notable package.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:16.980
Can I say my own package?

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.760
Like a different package that I created?

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:19.420
If you want.

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:23.460
Something that I created as sort of an extension is called Masonite validation.

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:27.540
I needed, again, something extremely simple to create.

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.500
So to create validation.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.160
And I didn't really see anything that was simple.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.400
I saw like, I think something's called pillow or marshmallow or something.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.160
It just wasn't what I wanted.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.300
So I created this validation package.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.820
And you could see it in the Masonite organization on GitHub that you could bring in.

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:43.140
And it's not just for Masonite.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.840
It's for any, it's for Django or Slack or anything.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.620
So you could pull it in.

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.960
It'll only pull in the validation part of Masonite.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.000
And you can validate dictionaries.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.580
You could validate multidimensional dictionaries.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:56.960
You validate, you know, JSON responses and stuff.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.200
It's a really, really cool package.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:58.560
Okay.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.520
That sounds really nice.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.200
All right.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:00.940
Final call to action.

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.560
People are maybe interested in checking out Masonite, interested in getting started.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.420
What would you tell them?

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:11.380
So if you go to the main GitHub page, GitHub slash Masonite framework slash Masonite, you'll

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:12.460
see a link to the Slack channel.

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:12.620
Yeah.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.340
And I'll link to that in the show notes as well.

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:14.600
Yeah.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.540
I'll link that in the show notes.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:15.780
Yeah.

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:20.020
The Slack channel, which is, I'm really, really responsive.

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:23.800
It's about, it's almost 350 people in that Slack channel so far.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.040
Everybody's really, really friendly.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:25.760
So you can join there.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:34.120
And then on Twitter, at Masonite Project, I post news and tips and tricks and stuff like

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.080
that on Twitter as well.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.100
So if you want to learn Masonite on Twitter, then you can join there.

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:38.540
All right.

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:42.660
Well, it looks like a cool framework and it has a really unique way of working with it,

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.040
I think.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.900
And yeah, congrats on it.

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:45.100
Yeah.

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:45.400
Thank you.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:45.680
You bet.
