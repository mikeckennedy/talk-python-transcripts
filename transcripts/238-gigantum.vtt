00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.020
Collaborative data science has a few challenges.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.340
First of all, those who you're collaborating with

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.000
might not be savvy enough in the computer science techniques.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.180
For example, Git in source control or Docker in Linux.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.740
Second, seeing the work and changes others have made is a challenge too.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.060
That's why Dean Klysis and his co-founders created Gigantum.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.300
It's a platform that runs either locally or in the cloud,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.200
and it spins up data science environments into Docker containers seamlessly on your local computer.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.100
And it syncs collaborative updates from machine to machine.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.300
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 238, recorded October 17th, 2019.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.860
Dean, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.620
Hey, how's it going?

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.740
Hey, it's going really well.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.780
It's good to have you here.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.640
Yeah, it's great to be here.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.480
Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun to talk about repeatable data science

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.920
and collaborative data science and stuff like that.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.120
And you and your co-founder have put a ton of work into turning this into some platform

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.220
that folks can use.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.040
And that's really great.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.440
So we're going to talk all about that.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.500
Before we get into it, though, let's just start with your story.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.700
How did you get into programming in Python?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.960
I was pretty fortunate early on.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.500
You know, my parents got us a computer.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.300
So I've always kind of had computers around.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.140
You know, I remember battling with my parents to get like dial up in the house.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.480
And that was like a huge deal.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.060
You know, I definitely was in the AOL era getting home, you know, from school and like

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.380
jumping right on.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.520
So like, like everybody.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.340
Yeah, of course.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.840
And, you know, the worst was when somebody would pick up the phone, right?

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.820
You're in the middle of something and they wouldn't know.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.860
They'd pick up the phone in some other part of the house and it would kill your connection.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.220
You'd be like, come on, I was downloading something.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.800
It took an hour to get a megabyte and you just killed it.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.220
That's why definitely overnight you were definitely like downloading stuff, you know?

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.620
And like, we definitely were the one phone line still.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.880
Like everyone, I had my GeoCities website packed with like our construction gifts, you know,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.980
all the staples.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.000
So, you know, that kind of got me going, web development, you know, poking around, if you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.680
would call it that.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.280
Then, you know, and then high school, I did a bunch of random programming classes and through

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.640
college, you know, kind of more like, you know, dabbling here and there.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.280
I took, you know, I had a visual basic thing, some Java.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.480
I was doing mechanical engineering at first and started doing a lot of MATLAB and then

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.160
picked up electrical engineering at the University of Rochester.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.080
And that's kind of like where I was started getting a little bit more into programming as

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.720
more of a serious thing and then just something I poked around at.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.160
And, you know, really because of my initial career path, I started at Northrop Grumman for

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.360
a little while before I went to Johns Hopkins, was doing like a lot of MATLAB.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.300
And that kind of got me started and then started using Python and, you know, was just

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.220
like, wow, this is amazing.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.860
Never looked back.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.000
Right?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.860
Like, why was I using MATLAB?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.920
Never looked back.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.060
And so, yeah.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.440
So especially when I was at Johns Hopkins at the Applied Physics Laboratory, I was there

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.960
for a while.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.100
Did a lot of Python, mainly, mostly Python development there.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.540
What kind of stuff were you studying there?

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.520
When I was at...

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.380
At Johns Hopkins, yeah.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.660
Yeah.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.360
So, like I said, I did my undergrad at the University of Rochester.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.820
I'm in mechanical engineering and electrical computer engineering.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.740
And then I did a master's at Johns Hopkins in...

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.220
Focused in robotics and control.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.840
Okay, cool.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.500
And then when I was at the Applied Physics Lab, that was as like a staff member engineer

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.980
there.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.400
And so that...

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.220
My time there was in this group called the Intelligent Systems Center.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.220
And it's this really wild place.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.580
They kind of took a bunch of neuroscientists, a bunch of computer scientists, a bunch of

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.700
roboticists, kind of like smashed us together in a building and, you know, hoped for...

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.840
novel things to happen.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.620
And it was, you know, really cool.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.900
Did a bunch of really interesting things with a lot of external collaborators.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.720
So working in a lot of applied neuroscience work, doing some high-resolution brain mapping,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.380
some things with the hospital.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.440
So doing some natural language processing and machine learning in the clinical setting for

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.280
quality improvement.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.420
So got to do a lot of really interesting stuff.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.260
And almost all of that was really in Python.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.940
And we would build these pretty large production quality systems.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.820
And often, you know, we would do it on Python.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.520
And then there would be little bits where there was something that was really computationally

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.240
intensive or whatever.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.680
And that little bit would be written in C.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.920
And we'd C-type bit.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.100
And everything else is just, you know, lots and lots of Python.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.500
So...

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.940
Yeah, that sounds like a ton of fun.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.060
I worked in some research groups with a bunch of cognitive scientists before.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.260
And there's a lot of computation for what, to me, kind of felt at first, like, almost like

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.920
psychology and stuff.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.340
And but it turns out there's a lot of computational stuff going on in those research groups and

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.220
in that discipline.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.980
If you're collecting some sort of data, you eventually need to do something with it.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.740
And this is like across all fields.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.560
You weren't...

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.120
You know, recently, I was speaking with a bunch of, you know, we're working more and more with

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.220
people in the social sciences.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.840
So, you know, people doing food science, people doing, you know, economics, obviously.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.560
But these places that you don't treat, think as traditionally as, you know, the hard sciences

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.880
as being so data-driven and data science-driven are just, you know, they're getting into it,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.140
too.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.580
And they're just all the same problems.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.580
Yeah, they are.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.840
One of my daughters is in their second year of college, and she's studying psychology.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.520
And she sent me a text yesterday.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.080
And it said, Dad, do you know what our studio is?

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.960
I'm like, what?

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.720
It's like, yeah, we're using this for my psychology class.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.220
I'm like, oh, okay, that's pretty...

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.800
Too bad it's not Python or Jupyter.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.520
But, you know, still, it's interesting how, like, prevalent this type of computing that

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.440
the platform that you built for and that we're talking about is across all the disciplines,

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.800
right?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.380
When I think of Python and who should be a developer or any language, but especially Python,

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.560
and who should become a developer and get these skills, I often, maybe you've heard me

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.140
say it, is that Python can be a superpower for what you actually do, not your job.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.380
It doesn't have to be I'm a Python developer.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.940
It can be I'm a, like you said, economist, and I'm really good at it because I know Python

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.680
and Jupyter or something like that.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.460
And I see that kind of spreading quite a bit.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.900
Absolutely.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.140
Yeah.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.540
The ecosystem has gotten so rich, and the tooling has gotten so good.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.660
You know, really, it's opening to everybody.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.880
And we do see almost this split between, you know, there's Python and, you know, Python

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.380
Jupyter and then RStudio.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.820
You know, it's kind of like, and it's often aligned with fields, like some fields use RStudio

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.660
more, some fields use Python more.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.420
So it's kind of interesting to see how that all has played out as well.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.020
Yeah, for sure.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.460
I think there's some good inner exchanges between the two environments as well.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.640
So when you're doing this research, one of the things that was a bit of a motivation for

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.400
you to create this project that we're going to talk about is that you had folks from all

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.560
these different skill levels, from these different backgrounds, these different specialties, trying

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.820
to work together, right?

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.280
And that's got to be a problem or challenging, rather.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.080
Yeah, so, you know, that experience at, you know, six or so years at Johns Hopkins doing

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.020
these research projects and helping run these research projects really was, you know, you

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.820
feel this pain that makes you want to do something about it, right?

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.140
And there was a couple issues that we kept running up to that were, you know, became very obvious

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:28.760
after we spent like loads of energy doing something, you know, and it's like there's this issue

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.100
with asymmetries, right?

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.200
So you have people that want to work together that have very different skill sets.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.380
And they also care about different things about a project.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.560
And so how can you make these people work together?

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.680
And when it comes down to like the technical asymmetries, it's like, even if you know how

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.000
to use Git, or you know how to use Docker, or you know how to use some tool that makes

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.560
your work better, that person on the other side of that exchange, if they don't know it

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.880
as well, like all the energy you spent is potentially wasted because you just can't work together.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.640
You know, and so as you start building, you know, we're seeing the science is getting

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.140
harder, as people are starting to say, you know, discovery is getting harder, teams are

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.640
getting bigger, teams are getting more heterogeneous to solve more complicated problems.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.780
And it just like compounds this issue of asymmetries.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.440
And, you know, everybody's contributions on these projects is important.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.700
That's why we're all working together.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:26.440
And so if we can make it easier for people to work together, to not need to learn every single

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.040
complex tool to be able to see something or interact with something or contribute, you know,

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.560
it's just going to be better. And so we definitely were going that route to start of,

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.620
no, everyone will just learn these complicated things. Like it's this is the way you do it.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.460
Like, why aren't you going to be so better off?

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.920
People should be building these Docker images.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.500
Exactly. If they just learn Docker and Kubernetes, what's wrong with them?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.180
Yeah, like, I know they have a day job. That's fine. I know you're a doctor, but you need to learn

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.180
how to run this Docker container. So you can run this training for me, right? Like it just,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.020
it took a while to like learn that firsthand that everybody's, you have to, you know,

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:05.460
everybody's time is important. Everybody's busy and you want us all just to move as fast as we can

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.620
together. And that was a big motivator for a lot of the design decisions we made. And, you know,

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.780
as doing this, we were coming, a lot of these collaborations were coming from this angle that

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:19.200
we were pairing with biologists, with neuroscientists. So our first big thing, we started working with

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.680
this lab at Harvard run by Jeff Lickman, Bobby Casturi, and a bunch of people there doing awesome

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.900
high resolution brain mapping stuff. So they're using electron microscopy to actually map the brain

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.880
at single synapse resolution. So you can see how every single neuron and every single synapse is made.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.120
And so that whole field in general has exploded. They've got all this awesome stuff coming out now

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.080
out of this program called IR microns, which is what, you know, we worked on as well,

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.540
where they imaged cubic millimeter of brain tissues. This is like two and a half petabytes

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.700
of image data, right? And it's that small, right? It's like a cubic millimeter, which is actually an

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.120
incredibly small part of the brain. Correct. And this was done at the Allen Institute in Seattle

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.480
is where that imaging was done. In 2011, when we started that, it was this one lab in Harvard

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.660
imaging it, we go up there, the data's on a hard drive, you know, and it's like beginning the

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.440
application of can we apply some engineering to these, to the, you know, the science and make

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.900
it better. And it was an interesting collaboration. We built some database systems that were like

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.180
optimized for this type of thing. You know, we learned a lot. And it was that idea of like,

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.620
well, can we apply these like things we know from like software development, from proper engineering

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.860
and help apply them to the science? You know, that was a very obvious thing that like that needs to

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.300
kind of happen in data science, right? Like software engineering has done all these awesome things.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.300
Data science kind of needs some of that help. So that was kind of one of the founding

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:43.100
things we wanted to do as well. Right. Because we definitely have a lot of folks coming into

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:49.740
the data science world, not specifically from the computer science side, right? They're coming from

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:55.580
all these other fields as we've spoken about. And, you know, it's probably a bit of a stretch

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:02.040
just to be doing the programming at all. Much less go, yeah, we're going to learn about like refactoring

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:08.240
and unit testing and Docker and all these other things. And so with this big influx of folks,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.120
right, like it's, it seems almost like there's two paths. One path is to say, well, we're going to

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.980
all work together. And so what we're going to do is we're going to use the simplest, lightweight,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:23.300
least structured world as possible. And we're just going to use we're all going to install Anaconda.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:29.380
We're all going to run Jupyter. And we're just going to try to just, you know, maybe we'll use

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.100
version control, right? Because we got to share the files, or maybe we'll use something in the cloud.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:38.260
And that's one option. Another one is like what you guys went after, which is to build a platform

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:43.200
that makes those things transparent, but also actually does a lot of that stuff like

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.800
versioning with Docker. So you get exactly the same stuff over time and things like this. Yeah.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:54.200
Yeah. So there's all these things that are required to do good data science that aren't actually data

00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:01.060
science. And so like, it's kind of unfair to expect these people to be required to know it like over time,

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:06.300
you will learn like this idea that, you know, it's right now getting into data science is like a step

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:11.520
function, right? It's like, you don't just slowly start, you have to make this leap. Chris Holgraf

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.120
had this quote on Twitter the other day. That's from the Pangeo conference that I thought was perfect.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.840
That was, you know, learning data science often feels like needing a pair of scissors to open a package

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:26.360
of scissors. You know what I'm saying? It's like, yeah, this is what we expect from people. And so what we

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.560
really wanted to try to do is like, can we make this more of a ramp? Can you click a button and

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.740
get started? And that's fine. And then eventually you're like, oh, I see this is doing Git stuff.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.300
And I just merged something. And then you can learn what that means. And you can get under the hood.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.160
And you can write your own Docker snippets that get inserted in your Docker file if you want.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.440
But if you want to use a package manager, you can click some buttons. And you know, with time,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.140
you become more skilled. And it like, let's just say symmetry map,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.820
be a little bit less crazy. So that's a great segue, I think, over to this project that you guys

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.720
built called Gigantum. It's sort of the project to solve this problem that you've laid out for us,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.440
right? Yeah. So we kind of had the opportunity to, you know, get a little bit of money to try to start

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.440
this. So we were able to kind of, you know, quit day jobs, 100% effort to work on this project.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.840
It sounds like a dream, honestly.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:19.820
It kind of was. We spent so much time working on this project at Putt Hopkins that was just coming to its

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.440
peak. It was kind of hard to, you know, I left right around this time. It was kind of hard to do that.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.380
But like you said, it was just perfect to go and have an opportunity to go do this thing you've been

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.920
whining about for six years that someone needs to go fix this thing. And you finally have an

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.840
opportunity to maybe contribute and do it.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.040
You can like, you can work on one project like at Johns Hopkins and make that project great. Or you

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.100
can work on something like this and you could sort of meta solve it for the world, right?

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.900
Right. So fingers crossed. That's the plan.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.580
That's the plan. All right. So tell us about it.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.620
So yeah, what we built is this suite of tools that, you know, helps people of different skill

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.440
levels do like transparent, reproducible data science way faster and easier than they could

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.940
through kind of automation and ergonomics around all those, like I said, all those things that you

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.920
need to do good data science, but aren't data science. So the core of it is this thing we call

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:12.440
a gigantic client. It's open source, MIT licensed, basically web application. So you can run it anywhere

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:19.760
that manages a data science project or a data set. And so when I say project, that was another thing

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.720
that we felt was kind of the first thing that needed to be solved was there was no real, no real

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:29.380
currency in data science. There's no standards. There's no, there's no way to make an exchange with

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:34.100
another person because, you know, there's no standard way that you represent your environment

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.840
or your data or organize things. There's no easy way to ship it up, pack it up and ship it.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.500
Yeah. Just because you have a Jupyter notebook, that's not potentially enough. You also need the

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:48.680
libraries that notebook is going to depend upon. So something like a requirements file,

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.560
if you have data, right, you've got to package that data. Somehow all these things need to go

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.580
together, right? Like the read me about it and so on. Yeah.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:03.000
To make a project that's reproducible, but more importantly, kind of transparent so somebody

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.700
could understand what you did, why you did it, how you did it. You know, you need to bundle together

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:13.820
the code, the data, the environment, like you said, a read me, the work history, like who did what,

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.480
when, and you need to bundle that together. You need to track that and make it be automatic. So

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.960
that's what we did it. So the big thing that the client does is it tightly integrates with

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.780
Jupyter and RStudio. And it kind of gives you this interface, lets you upload your data,

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.780
drag and drop your code, build your environment. So you configure your environment. You can drag and

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.680
drop a requirements.txt file. If you got that, you can use package managers like PIP, Conda,

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.560
Act, or you can write custom Docker if you want to get under the hood. You know, it's really important

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.640
that it's that flexible because people really, you know, not every tool people need to use is sitting

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:52.180
in some package manager as well. And so the ability to be able to really build whatever you want was

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.960
really important. And so by putting that all together, the client then versions this all in

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.640
unison lockstep. So at any point in time, you can roll back and get the same environment, the same data,

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.860
view of your data, code. And because these tight integrations, what's really cool with what we've done is

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:13.960
as you are running your codes, you're writing in your Jupyter notebook, you execute some cells, we will detect

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.900
that that happened. We will automatically create a version. We will automatically generate some metadata to

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:24.400
like, let you know what you were doing. If you generate a figure, we kind of extract it and recompress it and save it,

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:30.600
so that you can get this visual history of what you've done as well. So it's not just about, you know, making this

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:36.780
thing easy to share, but it's kind of making it a little bit more intelligible. You're not looking at like some git history,

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:42.480
where it was just like, ran my code, ran my code, fixed the bug. Oh, crap, what's going on? It's like,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.880
created this figure, change these parameters, right? And that's going to be getting a lot better with time as we kind of

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.420
push on that.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:55.340
Yeah, that's really cool. And it's worth pointing out, I guess it wasn't obvious to folks, everything you've talked about so far

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.000
runs locally on your machine, 100%. Right?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.460
Right. So yeah, like I said, the client's designed to run kind of wherever, just a web application. So you can run on your

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:12.120
laptop, you can run it on a server in Amazon, we have lots of users that like to do that, right? They run on their laptop, they sync it

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.400
to some GPU instance or whatever, they do some training, they sync it back to their laptop and keep on working and only pay for

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:24.880
like a little bit of cloud time. You can also run it in our cloud. So you can click a project and play with it there

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:31.440
as well. It's an easier no installation. Because like I mentioned, this does require Docker. So you if you want to run on

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.900
your laptop, you have to install Docker on your laptop. That's gotten a lot easier.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:43.280
It's so much easier. It used to be really like quite, I hope I can make this work sort of feeling. But now it's like on the

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.000
Mac, you download the Docker Mac app, you double click it, it runs in the menu bar. And that's pretty

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.060
much the extent of it, right? Like you don't really have to know more. So it's pretty easy.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:57.260
Yeah. And Windows is getting a lot better. And Windows, there's some really awesome advances

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.640
coming out of the Windows team. Oh, yeah. Windows subsystem for Linux 2. It's gonna make Docker

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.680
containers run essentially almost native on Windows. It's gonna be great. It's gonna be coming out.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.720
Maybe tell people about the Windows subsystem for Linux, just what that is real quick.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.520
they might not be aware of it. Sure. So there's a version now that you can get if you've got Windows

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:21.120
that lets you effectively run a Linux kernel on Windows, like a shipping a Linux kernel with Windows

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:27.920
now and you can install Ubuntu and fire it up right there in Windows. And it's not really using a VM. So

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.040
in the sense that it was before. So if you install Docker desktop, which is Docker's product that you should

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.200
install when you're running on your laptop, it's got like little applique, like you're describing,

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.160
you know, that's going to run in a virtual machine to give you that Linux environment.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:48.120
So Windows subsystem for Linux is pushing all of this way farther down closer to the operating system

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:53.940
so that it's really almost like native performance. And this WSL 2 or Windows subsystem for Linux 2

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:59.680
that's coming out is just a much, much better version of that that lets you run Docker inside of it,

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.280
which is what's really exciting. Right.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.640
And so, yeah. So thanks for the sidetrack. Yeah. So you were talking about it's pretty easy to run

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:10.600
Docker on your machine now. Yeah. And we do like, as we talked about asymmetries, like installing software

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.040
on your computer is a thing people don't really do as much anymore and it's daunting. And so we do have

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:21.440
a desktop app that helps walk you through the Docker install and configure our stuff and just get it all

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.100
going for you as well. So you just kind of download that, double click it, and it should hold your hand to

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.500
the point where you just got a Jupyter notebook open. And that Jupyter notebook is running in a Docker

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:35.240
container in a Git repository for you. Yeah. When I was playing with it, that's how it worked. I

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.180
downloaded the app. I ran it. It just said, you know, please wait. We've got to download a bunch

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:44.240
of data because we're downloading, you know, Ubuntu or something like that. And it was fine. I just

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.160
chilled for a minute. And then, you know, you're right. I was right there. First thing it dropped me

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.840
is into Gigantum, the web app, which is a little bit like a Jupyter lab feel, a tiny bit. It shows you

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.100
like your projects and your data and stuff. And then you can actually launch or create new projects,

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.120
which then launch into Jupyter or RStudio, like, and so on.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:10.020
This portion of Talk Python to me is brought to you by Linode. Are you looking for hosting that's fast,

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.740
simple, and incredibly affordable? Well, look past that bookstore and check out Linode at

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:22.000
 talkpython.fm/Linode. That's L-I-N-O-D-E. Plans start at just $5 a month for a dedicated server

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.500
with a gig of RAM. They have 10 data centers across the globe. So no matter where you are

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.960
or where your users are, there's a data center for you. Whether you want to run a Python web app,

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.120
host a private Git server, or just a file server, you'll get native SSDs on all the machines,

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:43.120
a newly upgraded 200 gigabit network, 24-7 friendly support, even on holidays, and a seven-day money-back

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.100
guarantee. Need a little help with your infrastructure? They even offer professional

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.820
services to help you with architecture, migrations, and more. Do you want a dedicated server for free

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.160
That's really the client. And like I said, we have these apps that help run the client for you and

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.960
make it real easy. So you could run on your laptop with our desktop app, or you can run it on a server.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.600
We have a CLI. So if you prefer the command line, there's a little CLI version that you can just be

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.600
like, install Gigantum, run it. And so that's good for when you're running on some remote resource.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:22.740
And then we have our gigantum.com. There is this hub, which lets you sync and share your work and

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.660
preview other people's work and play around. And that's kind of how you can collaborate and move

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.980
things around from computer to computer, find content, find examples. That's kind of our,

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.880
it's a very decentralized system in that you can copy things wherever you want. And it's kind of like,

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.740
then there's this central piece where if you want to, you know, put your stuff in one place,

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.760
that's where it goes. Yeah. And you can synchronize across that. So a lot of cloud

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.680
systems, you log in, you run your code there and it just stays there, right? I'm editing there and

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:58.500
you're in that cloud for this project or whatever. But at least the desktop client version, the way it

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:03.720
works is it kind of synchronized, you can synchronize it up to the cloud and other people can download it

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:09.100
locally and run it and so on, right? And basically behind the scenes, seamlessly uses Git to keep

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:14.480
everything in sync, right? Yeah. So we're using Git or using Git LFS, which is Git large file service.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.900
So it's like when files get over a certain size, Git explodes. And so this is a way to handle

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:24.100
files that are bigger. And then when files get even larger, we use a different service that we've built

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:29.820
and that all is transparent. So you upload your data, we'll use LFS if we need to use it, we won't,

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.300
we'll use regular Git if we don't. So that's kind of managed as well for the user. But yeah,

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:39.020
so that lets you this idea of being able to sync versus like you said, having your code right there

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:43.860
in that platform, it lets you move it around wherever you want and put it on the right resource

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.140
to do what you want to do.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:51.920
Yeah. I was looking over at your GitHub organization for Gigantum and you have a bunch of different

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.320
projects there. And it looks like the stuff that you're talking about is open source, not necessarily

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.580
the cloud because a lot of SaaS providers, well, almost every SaaS provider does not open source their

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:07.140
SaaS thing. And that makes a lot of sense. But the Gigantum client and a lot of that stuff seems to

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.140
be open source. Is that the right reading of that?

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:14.800
The client is open source, MIT licensed. Also our desktop application and our CLI are there.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.640
We've got some other smaller packages we've built for various reasons as well. And that will always

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.300
be the case, right? The whole idea is this client, the actual workhorse of the whole thing

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:29.480
is free to use, lets you use it wherever you want for however long you want. And then it's only,

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.620
you know, like you said, we do have this somewhat proprietary piece, which is our

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:37.840
cloud infrastructure that lets you run a compute in our cluster and all of that sort of thing.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.740
Yeah. Okay. Interesting. So let's maybe talk through creating a project. I think that'll give

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:48.000
people a sense of what Gigantum offers and like why they might use it and so on.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.260
Sure.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.400
So yeah, go ahead and take us through it.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:54.180
When you create a project, effectively you're creating this specially formatted Git repository

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:59.500
with a bunch of extra information in it. So you start by running the client. Again,

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.280
like we just talked about, you could run it on your laptop, you can run it wherever you can

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:07.260
run it in our cloud. You create a project and you choose a base. So all projects start from

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:13.300
some base container. So we build a handful of them and have them available. So you can use Python 2,

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:18.100
Python 3, RStudio, Jupyter, JupyterLab. You know, they're kind of different configurations.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.220
We've got some that have CUDA support. If you want to do deep learning with GPUs,

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.280
we have some that come prebuilt with a whole bunch of data science packages.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.840
It's kind of like, you know, choose what you want there.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.060
Yeah, I could choose, you know, like, for example, if I pick Python 3, it says, do you want like

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.840
the full on data science workstation Docker image? Or do you want like the bare bones

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:44.560
just as Python 3 on it? Why would I choose one over the other? I mean, first impressions are maybe if I

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.660
choose the full on data science one, like it's another gig download or something like, but what

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.580
are the, why would you choose one over the other?

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:55.760
Yeah, basic. I mean, really, it just comes down to disk space, right? Like the pre-baked one has

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:02.360
a ton of packages that are kind of this somewhat community agreed upon set of things that are,

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:07.560
you know, core data science tools in Python. And so it's much larger. And then the minimal one is

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.700
obviously smaller. And so let's say, if you know what you're doing, if you were doing something where

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:16.860
you only need, you know, a couple packages, then maybe you just install those yourself. But if you,

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.760
you know, quick start, I just need requests and pandas. That's all I need. I know it.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.500
Yeah, something like that, right?

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.620
Then you don't need the rest of this. Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.800
Cool. Okay. So you pick one of these base images and technically it's a Docker image,

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.000
but people don't really know that. Like they don't need to know

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.820
that. They just need to know, I get a Linux operating system that has these capabilities,

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.240
right?

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.520
Yeah. I get a Linux operating system that has Jupyter and ready to go for me basically.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.680
And once you get the project created, you can augment this environment. So like you said,

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.640
if you want to install, you know, pandas and requests, you click on an environment tab. There's

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.320
a little widget there that lets you enter in the package name. If you have a specific version you

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.500
want, if not, it'll look it up for you. And that's an important thing to like all packages that get

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:04.480
installed are automatically pinned to a version. So there's none of this just install the latest every

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.340
time you run. It's no, it installed a specific version. And if you want to upgrade it, you can

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:12.580
upgrade it right there in the UI and it lets you know that there's an update available, but everything

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.080
is pinned.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.480
That definitely feeds into the reproducible science, reproducible computation side of things,

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:18.700
right?

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:25.320
Right. Making things reproducible is kind of a side effect of what we wanted to do, right? Like that

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:30.040
should just be the default world we want to live in where you're, we started talking about this as a

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.720
reproducible work environment. It's not, I did something and now I want to be able to do that

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.420
exact same thing later. So I do a bunch of work to make it reproducible. It's because I did this the

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:45.600
way I did this from day one. I can at any point in time reproduce that. And it's just, it's even if

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.760
you're not sharing with other people, your future self, like going back to a project you worked on

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:55.960
six months ago is like incredibly challenging. And so, you know, where were those files? What

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.600
virtual environment was I using? You know, where is it? And just having that taken care of,

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.200
it's just one less thing to worry about.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.140
Right. So the first time that you go through this project process and you pick a Docker image,

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:12.160
obviously underneath the scenes, it's doing like a Docker build, which might do a Docker pull and

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.880
download some of the various container images. I would guess the second, third and fourth time,

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.480
those are like just cached and nearly instant. So that's nice, right?

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:26.460
Yeah, absolutely. So we take advantage of the Docker caching. So if you reuse the same environment,

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.060
build almost instantly, all that kind of stuff is really nice.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.320
Yeah. So it goes in, it creates the Docker image and it runs through all the startup, which is like

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.980
pip install or condo install the things that are associated with that. You can even watch it build.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.180
Like I watched the little installer screen because I was just sitting there waiting like,

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.920
oh, let me just watch the build. If I go like, yeah, a bunch of pip install, just like I thought. Right.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:52.540
So that's all pretty good. And then it basically, once it's all done, it launches that and it drops you

00:27:52.540 --> 00:28:00.560
into a web app pointing back at localhost, some port, 8000, 8888, something like that, that goes back to

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:07.100
this web view into your workspace. And that's really the view of Gigantum that people see, right? That's

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.420
what they perceive it as, I would guess.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:13.000
Right. So that's where you can see, you know, if there's a readme, you can see the environment

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.600
configuration, you can upload. If you've got existing files, you know, that's where you would drag and

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:22.840
drop some notebooks or drag and drop a bunch of data. And it kind of gives you that organization

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:29.760
as well. You know, we kind of wanted to not so much in like, you know, enforce this and say,

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.540
this is how you have to organize things. But at the end of the day, we decided it was important,

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:39.320
like having starting to build some expectation around how things are organized, not only makes

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.880
building the software easier, but it just builds this intuition into what people, when you open up a

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.120
Gigantum project, you know where the code is, you know where the input data is, you know where the

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.620
output data is, at least you have that much, and then you're free to organize it however else you

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:57.220
want, right? But that's kind of how it's broken apart is you have these different bins, you drop

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:02.920
your data into your code into. And then there's we touched on a little bit as this activity feed. So

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:08.180
this is the history of everything you've done. So you'll see if you add a package, there'll be a

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.320
little entry that you change the package, if you add some files, if you delete some files,

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.060
if you run code. So everything you do, the system's constantly monitoring it. And it's

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:21.980
automatically making Git commits for you under the hood. And that's visible in that project view as

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:26.460
well. If you want to share with people, you can like push it to the cloud and give them a link and

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:31.280
they can download it or you can invite them to it or something like that. Does that include their history

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.440
in your local version as well? What's the collaboration look like around that?

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.300
Yeah. So if two people want to work together on a project, you know, someone creates it,

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:43.300
they publish it. By default, everything publishes privately. So only you will be able to access it.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:47.960
You're going to have to add a collaborator. And we've got permission model where you can add

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.100
somebody as an administrator, they can have read write, and they can have read only access. And that

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.640
kind of limits what they can edit, what they can see. But if they're able to write to the project,

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.960
they're able to run the code, make changes, change packages, whatever they want to do.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:09.120
And when they sync and you sync, we deal with that Git operation of fetch, pull, merge, push. So,

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:14.680
you know, by clicking sync, we're doing all of that for you. And you'll see in the activity feed,

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.260
your changes interleave together as well. So you'll be able to scroll and see,

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:23.080
oh, they changed this package or they added this data set or whatever.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.300
That's interesting. So if they like, they sync it down locally, they jump on a plane and they're

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:32.180
like working on the project. Maybe they change some of the code, they make some comments, they edit the

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:37.100
readme, whatever, and they get back and they push sync. It doesn't just sync like, well, here's their

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:43.620
commit message and their commit that actually goes into Git, but it actually syncs that activity back

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.460
in like a richer way.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.460
Yeah, everything they did, you see.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:53.520
Which, you know, is interesting. We have more features coming around this, particularly in the activity feed

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.960
around searching and filtering and changing views on that data because it's this rich set of information

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.440
that we've never really had, to be honest.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.240
Yeah, like how are people expected to work with it? What questions do they have?

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.920
Right. So like a common one we want to be able to make real easy is like, give me all versions of like this figure

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:16.620
or this cell, you know, so you can see as things change visually instead of trying to somehow do

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.240
Git diffs over and over or something crazy, right?

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.300
Yeah, I like it a lot. The activity feed can get pretty busy because it has like executed cells

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.520
and stuff like that. But yeah, so maybe some filters for like important, whatever you deem important.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.600
Like you guys just define important, like a figure was created or like code was changed or something like that.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:40.360
Yeah, yeah. That's definitely something we're working on improving is the having a small lightweight model,

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:45.880
especially around text output of saying what's important, what's not and making that very streamlined.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.200
So yeah, for sure. Let me think about this idea with you for a second here. One of the things that's

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:55.700
cool is it launches into JupyterLab, right? And JupyterLab is nice. It's sort of the premier way to do

00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:03.960
Jupyter things these days, right? And it gives you more than just the notebook. It gives you like GUI access to the file system.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.560
It gives you a terminal. It gives you like a markdown editor, other stuff like that, right?

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:15.500
So maybe I could fire up my project and I'm like, oh, I realize I need, I don't know, some library.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:22.760
I need this version of OpenSSL or I need to install, I don't know, something that I've got to do on Linux.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.480
Maybe I drop into the terminal, which you can do from Jupyter, right?

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.240
You can go and configure your environment and do all the things there, which is cool.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:36.300
What's the right flow? So maybe I've done that. I've created a project and I'm like, oh, I had to drop into the terminal and do this.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.980
Now I want to share this thing with people. What is the right

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.880
way to sort of record that that happened?

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.840
Should I go back and make an equal change in like my Docker config

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:56.580
on my project in Gigantum that would have had that effect of what I did in the terminal and then I could push that out?

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.620
Or do I create a new project and start over? Like what's the workflow there?

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:06.040
Yeah. If you go in and edit that runtime environment, you know, it's going to be lost effectively.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:12.660
So you would have to go back to the Gigantum client and just go to the environment tab and add that package or whatever.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:21.260
This is a really common thing we've heard is, you know, it's really annoying that you have to like remember to do that because that's a very common workflow.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:25.240
It's like I'm doing in the middle of something. I don't know how to do something. I look on the Internet.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.300
The Internet tells me what to do.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.360
Yeah, exactly.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.840
The Internet says install this package and I need to do that right now.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.600
And that means I have to shut everything off because I need to edit this Docker container.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:41.420
So that's something we're very much thinking about making a better experience of like being able to edit the runtime environment.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:50.140
But then when you stop, have that edit persist back because it's so common and it's like such a common way that people drift their project.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.900
Right. Like you you start all good at day one.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:57.940
You write your requirements.txt file, but then you just like get into it and you drift.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.720
Right. Right. Right. And it might not even be a Python thing.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.780
It might be some apt install type of thing.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:08.460
Right. Right. Or like I changed this environment variable in Linux so that it would work.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.820
Right. And so how do we make that better?

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.400
We've got a bunch of ideas that we've you know, we're starting to work on and and we do.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:25.920
You know, one thing that's been really fun in getting into this project is going from being this researcher mind of like just building tools to get it done to more like product development.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:31.200
So like this is something we know we want to solve, but like we've got ideas, but maybe our ideas are wrong.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.780
So we actually try to like do some user testing and that type of thing and like test it out before we build it.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:47.600
So, you know, more complicated features like this where it's not obvious what the right answer is takes a little bit more time because you have to actually like not just build what you think because, you know, it's right.

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.300
So that's been that's been really fun and interesting.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.460
It's definitely something we're going to be focusing on because we hear it.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.700
You know, it's one of those things where people are like, man, this is really annoying.

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.900
And those are the things you want to try to fix.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.980
You know, yeah.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.060
Go where the pain is and solve it for people.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.480
That stuff.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.320
That's almost always a good business opportunity.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:03.760
Right.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.100
Yeah.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.360
It sounds really hard to me, though.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.240
Like, how do you capture what people randomly did as they flailed about on the command line in a terminal?

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.200
So I'm not really saying like you must do this.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:21.540
I was just wondering like, OK, well, what is my proper if I were to correct my just bouncing around on the terminal?

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.780
What would I do in that platform?

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.040
Right.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:24.340
Yeah.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:24.540
Yeah.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.760
And so it would be you'd have to go to the environment tab and edit it yourself.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:37.100
But it's interesting because of these tight integrations and because of the, you know, the architecture of Jupyter and Jupyter Lab, which is really cool in that it's basically under the hood.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.220
They've got this pub sub architecture.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:43.360
So there's just messages flying around of like everything you're doing in the interface.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.340
We can listen to those messages.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.800
And that's how we're built this tight integration.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.240
So that's how we know when you executed some cells and you produced a figure.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:36:00.540
There's this under the hood in Jupyter, there's this pub sub architecture that's emitting messages that are containing what you're doing and containing the figure.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.040
I mean, we're able to scoop all that up and analyze it.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.780
And that's how this auto activity is happening.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:05.260
I see.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.720
OK, so you probably could capture like an apt install such and such.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:08.980
Yeah.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:09.880
Potentially, right?

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.820
I mean, yeah, maybe editing files is tricky.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.020
But some of the command line options, yeah, for sure.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:18.800
It seems like you could say, hey, it looks like you installed Nginx.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.780
Did you really do that?

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:28.320
Because if you did, we're going to need to put that into the config for Docker because that's like a Linux wide thing that you need to have possibly to keep working the way you are.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:28.500
Right.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:28.720
Right.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:28.940
Yeah.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.160
Right.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:29.380
Nice.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.960
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Tidelift.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:44.260
Tidelift is the first managed open source subscription, giving you commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:53.020
And with Tidelift, you not only get more dependable software, but you pay the maintainers of the exact packages you're using, which means your software will keep getting better.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:37:00.260
The Tidelift subscription covers millions of open source projects across Python, JavaScript, Java, PHP, Ruby, .NET, and more.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:12.280
And the subscription includes security updates, licensing, verification, and indemnification, maintenance and code improvements, package selection and version guidance, roadmap input, and tooling and cloud integration.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:17.540
The bottom line is you get the capabilities you'd expect and require from commercial software.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:25.960
But now, for all the key open source software you depend upon, just visit talkpython.fm/Tidelift to get started today.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:32.740
Maybe we could talk a little bit about some of the projects you have on the website.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.680
Actually, before that, let's take a step back.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:47.860
So at the time of the recording, basically, your cloud is kind of like a synchronization, bookkeeping location, but you're just about to roll out the ability to run the code on the cloud as well.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:53.400
If you don't want to install the client and run Docker, maybe just tell us what's the story around that.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.360
And then I'm going to talk to you about some of the demo apps you got out there.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:56.580
Sure.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:56.760
Yeah.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:03.820
So this has been a really big effort to basically, from the ground up, completely rebuilt our cloud platform for this big change.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:12.300
And so what we're adding is when you sync a project to Gigantum.com, it now becomes much more interactive and rich.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.180
You can preview files.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.320
You can look at the notebooks.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.740
You can see the activity.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.660
All those sorts of really useful things right there just on the website.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:26.620
But then you can also, like you said, you can click a button and launch that JupyterLab instance right there in the cloud.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:33.700
And that's going to let people with zero install play with their projects, explore other people's projects.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:39.360
You know, we've really found from talking to users, there's all different reasons you do different things.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:45.660
And so, like, if you're just quickly looking at somebody's project or you see some link on Twitter and you're like, what is this thing?

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:51.100
And you look at the thing, you know, you're not going to then go install Docker on your laptop just to, like, see what the thing is.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:51.340
Right.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:39:04.080
And so, again, this idea of asymmetries and it's what you actually care about really brings that barrier down to being able to just click a button, play with somebody's code or, you know, do something real quick with your code and your data.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:10.760
We also are going to allow some anonymous use as well because I think that's really useful to just be able to, like, I just don't need to sign up.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.360
I don't need to log in.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.520
I just want to see this thing real quick.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.240
What is this?

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.460
And so that's going to be a big piece of it as well.

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:15.720
Right.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.800
Maybe you just want to read it, but, like, it's got to execute it, right?

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.040
Like, you want to just see what is this thing?

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:27.100
I just want to see the output and maybe I just need to run it real quick to get fresh data or something like that, right?

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:27.400
Right.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.140
And it's going to just let you do that right there, right there in the platform.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.740
So we've been working real hard.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.460
It's really interesting new stuff.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.820
It's a mix of, you know, under the hood, Python and Go.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:37.980
It's on Kubernetes.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.780
It's the main orchestrator for all the containers and everything.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.560
Yeah, okay.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.360
That sounds really...

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.160
Very excited about it.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.140
Yeah, that sounds very exciting.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.140
It's a cool addition to the project.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:55.240
You know, there are some places that will, like, give you this read-only executed view of these Jupyter Notebooks.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.140
And honestly, I don't know how they work super reliably.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:01.080
But there's things like Binder and there's...

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:05.540
Even if you go to GitHub, like, they'll run some Jupyter Notebooks for you there.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:05.860
Mm-hmm.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:13.540
It sounds to me like those can't have, like, a complete underlying environment configured for that notebook, I would guess.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.280
Is that right?

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.460
For GitHub, they're doing, you know, kind of static rendering of the notebooks.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:28.200
So if, you know, what's nice about Jupyter Notebooks, well, depending who you talk to, this is nice but also annoying sometimes, is, like, everything is in the notebook, right?

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.640
It's this big JSON document.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.680
And all...

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:35.880
The last state of your notebook, if you ran your cells and you've got figures, it's there.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:41.680
So you can run it through an awesome tool called NB Convert, which will turn it into, like, an HTML page, for example.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.160
Yeah.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.740
And then you can view it on the web.

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.820
So we do that on the website.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.480
So you can view previewed notebooks.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.180
And you mentioned Binder.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:55.560
So Binder's a great tool that lets you take a Git repo and click it and execute it.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:02.560
So it actually gives you a working Jupyter environment as long as you've configured your repository in a certain way and you've got all your package dependencies and all of that.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.720
And so that actually gives you an interactive version, kind of similar to what we're doing, where you can get an interactive version.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.540
You can actually edit.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:16.960
I would say, like, kind of the one difference is because of how we build things, you know, to put it in Gigantum means that that environment's correct for that notebook.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.820
So you'll be guaranteed to be able to run it, to render it.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:28.860
And because we have that environment, especially like in R, to render some of the R notebooks for previews, you kind of need that actual environment as well.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.040
Right.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:34.180
So having that around, it makes it a little bit easier for us to be able to render these things for WebView.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.240
Yeah.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.300
Give me this project.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.360
And you literally have everything set up in a Docker container, right?

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:41.640
Yeah.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:41.960
Yeah.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.180
Yeah.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:42.620
Super cool.

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.000
Let's talk about some of the demo projects.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:52.520
There's something just fun about going around nice written notebooks and just clicking through them and watching them do their magic.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.080
So you guys have some of those up on the site.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:01.320
Like you mentioned the Allen Brain Institute before about the measuring the millimeter Cuba brain.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.180
You've got some stuff like that up there that people can explore, right?

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.420
They have an SDK, so they have like a little library you can install with Python.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:11.880
It lets you access some of their data sets and visualize the data and play with it.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.800
And so there's an example project that kind of shows you some examples of how to do that.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:23.180
We have some other examples for doing things like transfer learning and some NLP tasks, some plotting.

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:27.100
So like a lot of people do, there's some great geospatial plotting libraries.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:33.540
So we're working to kind of build some of these examples that are very obvious that, like you said, you're a new user.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.420
You just want to get started, dip your toes in.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.080
Sometimes that's hard to just, what do I even do?

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.120
Or what can I do?

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:45.180
Like I don't even know what's possible that I could do if I had the data and the skills, right?

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:45.460
Right.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:51.740
So having something that you said is like organized nicely and simple, you can click, run, get your feel of what's going on.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.860
We have a bunch of those going up as well.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.060
Yeah.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:54.340
Yeah.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:54.660
Awesome.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.880
We can put some links just in the show notes for people to check out.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:06.820
So one thing I did want to talk to you about while we were on these things is I recently had the folks from Doc Assemble on.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:12.040
And you probably don't know what Doc Assemble is, but Doc Assemble is a project.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:20.560
It's a web app with a bunch of cool features for like a super advanced survey monkey type thing.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:27.560
If I want to interview a bunch of people, collect the data, have a lot of flow control and only ask questions conditionally and so on.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.780
There's a really cool project that does that.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.080
And the way they, it's for mostly for lawyers, but it can be used for anything.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:39.020
And the way they do that is they have one or more Docker containers that work together and they deliver those.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.300
And some of the feedback I've got from multiple people was that's really awesome.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.260
It's super hard for me to work with Docker.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.780
This is not making it better.

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:57.860
It might be worse for me than installing, just installing like Postgres and Redis and Python.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.800
Like this might actually be harder than those things, trying to get multiple containers to talk to each other and stuff.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:08.600
So the reason I bring that up is it seems like what you all have done here is doing the same thing.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:14.720
But the way that I experienced it as a user was, well, I have to have my system be Docker capable.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.660
So I had to install Docker, the app.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.380
And then I double clicked your app.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.300
It gave me a cool progress bar, which took a minute or two.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.300
And then it was working.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.020
Right.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.940
And that feels like a great way to use Docker.

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:25.600
So I don't know.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:33.360
What are your thoughts on like trying to deliver products to users through Docker or shipping with Docker just in general?

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.740
What's your experience there?

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:43.160
Yeah, that's an awesome question because very early on, it was like something we kind of battled with for a bit and then made this decision like this is the way we want to go.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:43.400
Right.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:48.760
So you mentioned, you know, Conda as a way to package all your code and data.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.080
You know, people use that a lot as a way to manage their environment.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:55.700
And we were like, well, should we reinvent the wheel or should we go with something more complicated?

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.740
And it just really came down to not everything's in a package manager.

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:06.460
And you really the only real way is to right now that we see is you need to put everything in a container.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.420
That's the only real way you'll be able to bundle everything up.

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:15.340
And then you go and you look at the space and Docker is the provides the easiest user experience for that.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.860
And so that's the decision.

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:17.040
Right.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.920
We're going to go with Docker.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:25.880
And when we started this, the experience wasn't perfect, but we're kind of making this gamble that we're going to meet Docker when they're ready.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.740
We'll be ready.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:27.160
Right.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.980
And so they've really been spending.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.620
I'm going to schedule where the puck is and I'm pretty sure it's going to be in the place we want it to be.

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.280
So let's try that.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:33.860
Absolutely.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.240
That's definitely what happened.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.000
And so we're feeling pretty good.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.120
Like Docker desktop team, they've been doing an awesome job just building these tools, making them more robust.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:52.100
Like they've been focusing super heavily on performance fixes because there were also disk IO problems with Docker on your laptop for a while.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.320
So they've been working super hard on making those better, making the installation process better.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:04.480
And so we think, you know, if a user can get Docker installed on their laptop, we can, they don't know how to need to know how to use Docker, how to make everything work.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.420
We can do that.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:05.720
Right.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.900
But it's just, can we get Docker on their laptop?

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:15.480
And so we've been testing with that recently because we didn't actually think that was an issue at first.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.100
It's one of those things like it's an afterthought for you to install Docker.

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.860
So why would people have problems doing this?

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:21.860
And that's like so flawed.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:22.120
Right.

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.720
It's something that no one even did.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.600
The user might even know what Docker is.

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.580
And you're like, hey, go install this crazy thing.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:33.720
So what we've recently been working on is we've this new version of our desktop application, which is very lightweight.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.480
You double click this thing.

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.640
It helps you install Docker and answer.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.980
The other thing, too, we found a lot of users just have questions like, why do I need Docker right now?

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.300
How much disk space?

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.400
What is this thing doing?

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:52.980
So even just like right there as they're walking through the Docker install process, let them know what's going on, help them do it.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.580
And then there's nothing to worry about.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:47:00.260
And so that's kind of this this handholdy approach where we like we tell you what to do.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.400
And then since we're on the computer already, we can wait until you've done it.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:07.640
Like until you actually install Docker, we know you haven't installed it yet.

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.440
And as soon as it's working, we're like, great.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.900
Now we need to adjust your memory and your CPU to make it work right.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.260
And then we can do that for you.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:14.500
Right.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:18.920
Instead of having to read, you know, our previous installation process was like, it's easy.

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.020
It's three steps.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.620
And then you click on it and like step one expands to like this bulletin list.

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.520
And you're like, well, it doesn't seem very easy.

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:25.860
Right.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.920
And that's not just three.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.740
And that's really.

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:28.600
Yeah.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.800
So really, it's about that.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:37.900
You know, I do think that delivering this application in a Docker container is an interesting way to do it and the right way to do it right now.

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.960
It lets us also like we deliver our application in a container as well.

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:51.260
But it's just really just working on the ergonomics a bit about around the installation process and making it very streamlined and kind of a closed loop.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.740
This is what we've been trying to do with our desktop application.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.300
It's not like follow these instructions.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.380
It's like we're here.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:57.940
Let's get from A to B.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.500
And once we get there, then there's nothing to worry about.

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.440
Yeah, I think it's a pretty polished process.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.680
And it worked pretty seamlessly for me.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.300
So, yeah, nice work on that one.

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:14.620
One thing I do want to talk to you about on this, of course, is business models, lock-in, things like this, right?

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.940
Because what you guys are building is really cool.

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:22.900
However, when I go to the site, it's in beta mode and it doesn't have like a pricing.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.180
And it doesn't have an obvious way that I'm going to get charged.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:32.280
So I always wonder about companies when there's, is it going to be a paid product?

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.320
Is it going to have like a premium angle?

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.720
Just, you know, just give us a sense of like where you guys are going as a business.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:49.340
Because not just is it interesting as a user, but as just observers of the open source space, how are companies doing open source plus business, I think is an interesting view.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:59.320
This was, again, one of these conscious decisions where like we think we can do this this way because it'll help us keep this whole endeavor sustainable.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:07.640
And we're living in this world of like movie pass a bit where just free money is just given away, you know, freely.

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:15.060
And we really wanted to build something that we hope we can make sustainable by actually trying to build a company around it instead of just an open source project.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:26.300
So that was kind of why we did it this way in terms of like how would we plan to monetize the core platform, the core piece, this client, like all that stuff, MIT license, free forever.

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.460
So we're not like going to try to ever charge for use.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:32.080
You know, you working on your on your local system.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.300
It's like it's yours, whatever.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:33.700
Right.

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.740
Where the monetization is going to come in.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:36.880
You have a six core laptop.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.600
So we're going to charge you $10 per core per month.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.760
It's like, no, what is this?

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.280
This is not Oracle.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.800
Exactly.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.660
This is not Oracle.

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.920
Yeah, that's like the motto, right?

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:47.180
Okay.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:50.640
So the desktop experience is basically going to be free.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.220
Is that my hand in that right?

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:52.460
Correct.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:52.860
Okay.

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.240
And also, like I said, you can run that desktop experience.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:50:03.240
You can also run that on your own Amazon, GCP, DigitalOcean, Azure, whatever it's or, you know, you need more compute horsepower.

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.040
It runs on whatever you put it on.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:06.220
Right.

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.180
So that's free forever.

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:15.880
Our hub that where you sync to, there's always going to be this free tier where we're going to allow you to store, you know, something like five gigs for free.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:16.920
Get a certain amount.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.200
If you sign up, you get a certain amount of compute per month.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.500
That'll kind of be like a refreshing quota every month that you can just poke around for free.

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.080
And then there'll be like a little bit of a tiering on that.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.240
That's when you actually end up paying.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:34.780
So if you need to store 50 gigs, 100 gigs, whatever, you'll have to, you know, pay a little bit of money per month for that.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:38.660
And then there'll be an on-prem enterprise offering.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:47.060
This idea where people want to use this, but they've got restrictions because, and this is moving more out of academia towards like industry a bit.

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:51.380
But like, you know, you can't put your data in somebody else's cloud for whatever reason, whatever.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.840
You want to control everything.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.240
Sure.

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:58.540
Similar to like GitHub Enterprise, that kind of model and customer base.

00:50:58.540 --> 00:50:58.880
Correct.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.880
Very similar to that.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:00.140
Okay.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:03.640
And so that's the plan for, you know, monetization of the platform.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:14.040
With, you know, our goal to our core, right, is to try to make this as an effective tool for people to use that, you know, isn't something that you get locked into.

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:15.300
And then you screw it.

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.580
I guess that's a good place to talk about like lock-in.

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:25.460
Fundamental principle kind of as we built this, right, is this under the hood, if you look at what's going on, it's just a bucket.

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.480
It's just files.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.440
It's just a repository, right?

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:34.040
We don't have some complicated database that you have to export your stuff out of.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:37.760
Like, we're built on top of Git, built on top of Docker.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.640
You know, we've built our custom extensions on top of it that you do not need.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:51.100
So if you want to take your stuff and pull it out of Gigantum, like you click the export button, all we're doing is just zipping up the thing and giving it to you as a single archive, right?

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:57.800
But you can go in your file system, take your files out, take your Docker file out, and do whatever you want with it.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.640
So there is no real lock-in in that sense.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.260
We're keeping it all built on top of these standard tools.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.280
It sounds really good.

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:17.280
And so I'm looking at my home directory in my MacBook here, and I see a Gigantum folder and then my username and then more username and then probably my Gigantum username.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:24.220
And then lab books and other things that are basically the projects that you guys have.

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:28.480
And it looks like you just get cloning that stuff into those subdirectories even, right?

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:33.880
So I have – and the file formats are things like Jupyter Notebooks and text files and whatnot, right?

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.860
So I could just take those and run with them if I wanted.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:42.800
I mean, you would lose the activity stream and collaboration, but you would still – you could just grab the files and go if you need to, right?

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:43.600
Absolutely, yeah.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:48.900
And so you'll see how we've done this activity, this – you know, the thing that's the rich layer on top.

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.420
It's really built on top of the Git log.

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:56.460
So, you know, when you do Git commit and you type a message, that message is getting written into the Git log.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.260
And so what we are doing is we're auto-generating that message.

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:05.280
And then if you'll see, there's kind of like a new line, and then there's some cryptic messages below that, some like random text.

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.820
And those are pointers into this like Git compliant data store we've built.

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:16.680
And so you can lose that extra rich metadata of like the figures that were extracted and stuff like that.

00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.180
But at the end of the day, every Git message is still there.

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.360
The history is still there.

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:26.840
It's just you lose a little bit of the automation, a little bit of like the rich history if you pull it out.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.200
But it's trivial to pull out.

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.940
And that's kind of – was intentional.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:30.560
Sure, that's cool.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:38.560
So if people want to try it out and they use it and they decide, well, I don't want to necessarily be committed to this thing, they could take their code and run, it sounds like.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:39.140
Yep, absolutely.

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:45.140
It's not like a Gigantum notebook that's not really a Jupyter notebook underneath or something.

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:45.520
Right.

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:51.900
One of these principles is we just wanted to keep it as close as possible to the originals, you know, these core technologies.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:58.460
We want to get out of your way, you know, and let people just click a button, get into Jupyter, get in our studio, do what they're used to.

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:01.020
Don't try to really change these flows too much.

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:01.400
That's cool.

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:09.300
As maybe a Git power user, maybe I like really want my stuff in GitHub in some project there, even if that's not the primary.

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.960
It's not a primary source, but like kind of a copy in Git.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:21.760
Would it be reasonable to drop into that local Git repository that Gigantum is creating and then create a new origin, like a remote branch and push to that one?

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.380
Do I just get it up to –

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:24.360
Yeah, you could definitely do that.

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.340
The only thing to keep in mind there is because we are doing Git LFS.

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:35.580
So if you've got a lot of LFS data, it's going to use LFS to push that to GitHub and GitHub charges you for LFS.

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.400
Right.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:44.480
So that's kind of the one thing to think about if you want to try to do a mirror to GitHub is that they might start charging you money at some point for your usage there.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.400
I think it's one gigabyte tree or something like that.

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:46.660
Okay.

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:53.020
But in general, I could mirror it to another Git repository and periodically sync that if I wanted, right?

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:53.440
Absolutely.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.760
Yeah, I like that.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.260
That's a pretty not super locked in lock-in story.

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.120
I like it.

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:58.980
That's the goal.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:02.500
You know, we want to make it easy to pull stuff in to Gigantum.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.640
We also want to make it easy to push stuff out, right?

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:12.440
Like the idea of building these walled gardens is kind of where the data science world has gone a bit with these massive cloud-only platforms.

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.460
There's only so much utility to that.

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:20.280
Again, if you want to work with somebody who doesn't have access to that thing or doesn't want to use it, right?

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:26.280
So being able to – even if you lose some capability, like being able to move things around is just in everybody's best interest.

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:26.640
Yeah.

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.920
Something that really bothers me a lot, I don't know.

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:37.720
It might be that I don't go to like a giant office building that has like a floor with a bunch of cubicles and I sit down and want to work and that's how I work.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:43.380
But like I work more sort of freely as I like roam about throughout my life, right?

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:47.600
Like, you know, I might decide I want to go to a coffee shop because I'm tired of being at my house totally alone.

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.220
And I'm going to go crazy, right?

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:58.820
But the thing that I think drives me crazy about a lot of the cloud stuff, and I'm not thinking just the notebooks, but also like AWS or Azure.

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:10.740
If you're like bound in deeply into all those services, like working disconnected on an airplane, at a conference, on a business trip, at a coffee shop, it's super hard to like just keep working, right?

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:19.980
But it sounds like what you guys have here is like I could go and go on a camping trip and do some data science if that's how I want to disconnect and come back and it would totally work, right?

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:23.340
Yeah, you come back, connect to the internet, click sync, and there you go.

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:24.120
I really like that.

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.520
I think that's quite a compelling option actually.

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.080
So super, super cool.

00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.720
Let me just ask you something really quick.

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:33.180
We don't have a ton of time to spend on it, but you get to see a lot of folks.

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:38.100
And maybe that's also another final question is who is this for?

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:43.660
If I am a professional data scientist at an insurance company, is this for me?

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.480
If I am a professor, is it for me?

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.320
If I'm teaching a class, is it for my students, right?

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:49.880
Who is this for?

00:56:49.880 --> 00:57:00.260
Today, I would say because of what we have, it's maybe not for like you at an insurance company yet because they do need these very enterprise-y features we haven't built yet, right?

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:08.500
So it's really, you know, that's where we went ahead because we think that's, you know, a huge space where data science is kind of taking over industry like it is everywhere, right?

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:22.140
But right now, you know, if you're a student, if you're someone who wants to get into data science, you know, if you do data science for research, academic research, publishing, you know, this is kind of the core people we've been working with to start.

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:28.320
We have one of the co-founders, Randall Burns, is he's a computer science, chair of computer science at Johns Hopkins.

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:31.780
And he, you know, he ran a course inside Gigana.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:32.980
And we learned a lot from that.

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.020
We've kind of made some changes.

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:42.280
Like running courses certainly is reasonable because you can deliver to your students both like notebooks, but also the environment, right?

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.880
And they don't have to install stuff.

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:48.980
It seems like it would be really good for teachers actually, you know, assuming there's enough teachers on Docker.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:49.420
Yeah.

00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:49.740
Yeah.

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:52.360
That's definitely, you know, target audience.

00:57:52.360 --> 00:58:04.040
But right now, you know, users have been very academic focused, but we've started to get lots more in smaller industry, you know, commercial interests because it's just a different way of doing things.

00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:09.420
And it's like a bunch of small teams working distributed, you know, just kind of set up to support that.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:17.460
So we're definitely thinking about moving there and building things, you know, more for kind of like an enterprise-y use case.

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:24.780
But, you know, for today, it's really if you're doing something in Jupyter, you're doing something in our studio, we think we can make that easier basically.

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:25.820
That's cool.

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:26.240
All right.

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:30.160
Well, it seems like you've built a pretty cool environment and I like it.

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.900
Let me just ask you really quick.

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.880
What are some of the trends you see in data science and scientific computing?

00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:39.000
Because you're interacting with all these different folks from these different environments.

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:42.980
Like, what should people maybe be paying attention to in that space?

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:43.300
Yeah.

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:49.680
So we see a lot of interesting stuff and it's definitely changed over the course even of us starting this project.

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:58.840
One thing that's very obvious, at least from our users and all the people we talk to, is this really this move towards the open source languages, right?

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.020
It's Python.

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.520
It's R.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:04.160
It's much less MATLAB, right?

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.180
It's these things people are moving.

00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:09.260
And it's because the communities are there.

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.180
The tooling is there.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.680
The libraries are there.

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:15.140
I believe it's been interesting to see.

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:18.620
And so that's kind of also a conscious decision for us is that's what we're supporting right now.

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:21.200
Like we don't support, you know, MATLAB out of the box.

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:29.880
We don't support SAS or some of these other things because not running through a web app is hard, but also dealing with licensing is hard.

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:34.120
And we're just seeing people more and more be like, yeah, this is hard.

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:40.820
And I can get this great environment in Python, this great ecosystem of tools and this great community of support.

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:48.860
And so I think as you see increasingly more and more stuff getting published that's built on Python tooling and R tooling.

00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.200
And that's been really, really apparent.

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:51.960
Yeah, that's great.

00:59:52.040 --> 01:00:08.920
Another thing that we're starting to see a lot more of and it's something we were obviously like predicting a bit, not necessarily predicting, but banking on, right, is this idea of hybrid architecture in terms of, yeah, you use the cloud a bit, but you also have local resources that you want to run your compute on.

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:13.640
And we're seeing people want this more and talk about it now as if it's like this great idea.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:26.780
And if anybody really starts doing like legit machine learning, like deep learning where you're training a lot, like you very quickly realize how expensive GPUs are to use in the cloud.

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:32.540
I mean, if you're paying, like if someone's paying the bill for you, you don't notice, or if you got a bunch of credits, you don't notice.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:37.040
But like eventually you realize that, wow, this is really expensive.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:44.420
And so we're starting to see a lot of people that got started doing their machine learning in the cloud because it was so easy.

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.500
And then they realize it's really expensive.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.760
And so they're buying GPUs.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:55.940
And this is also kind of crazy to, you know, there's some interest, like Lambda Labs is an interesting company in the US that's building GPU boxes, like workstations.

01:00:55.940 --> 01:01:04.560
And, you know, but there's not much around this like turnkey GPU local thing, but it's people are, I think, want that because it's expensive.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.680
And it changes the psychology a bit of doing your work, I think.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:14.080
When you're not worried about paying for every cycle, it changes how you work, right?

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.600
So I'm definitely thinking that's going to be a larger trend.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.620
I think the cloud is this great thing that gives us all these awesome capabilities.

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:28.600
But I do think this, at least for the near future, it's going to be, you know, we have so much compute power locally.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.940
It's, you know, you're going to want to run distributed.

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:33.860
You're going to have jobs you want to run on your laptop.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.860
You're going to have jobs you're going to want to run on a server.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.280
You have jobs you're going to run in the cloud.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.900
And we just want to make that easier.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.480
And we see that being a trend.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.940
Yeah, my laptop has a core i9 with six cores.

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:47.020
Each hyperthread is a 12 and 32 gigs of RAM.

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:54.480
Like that probably solves most people's computational problems unless you're doing like truly big data or massive machine learning.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:54.780
Yeah.

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:55.160
Right.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:02:01.700
And it's like, especially with some of these great libraries that are coming out and Dask and all the stuff that like Rapids, all these things.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:08.240
It's just like you have all this power, but you're using your 12 cores to run Chrome, right?

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:13.280
Like that's what if you want to use a cloud platform, I mean, you may need some of most of those cores to run Chrome.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:17.320
But like that's like the value proposition people are being sold as.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:30.060
And I think, you know, right size for the right job is going to be the way that people are going to go because they're going to realize as more and more stuff gets more and more computationally intensive in all these different fields and all these different industries.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.520
You know, not everybody has incredible amounts of money to just, you know.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:34.800
Yeah.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.700
It totally makes sense.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:39.620
Now, are you guys thinking you're going to have this run it in the cloud for free thing?

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.700
Are you thinking of having a premium offer there?

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.820
Like I really do need to run this on a GPU for an hour.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:49.940
Can I just push a button into your platform and make that happen and pay you $10 or like what are you thinking there?

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:50.260
Yeah.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:53.320
So right now at launch, not yet.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:59.040
That's something we're definitely playing with and trying to learn how people want that to work.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:09.260
I think that's the kind of why we built some of this was, you know, also some of the some cloud platforms, this pricing model of, you know, I pay the same thing every month forever.

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.680
It's not really how people work either.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.120
They need bursts of compute because they're late for a paper deadline or they're running something now.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.660
But then they're like not doing data science for a month because their job is like more than just that.

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:20.820
Right.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:25.640
And so, yeah, how can we provide that in a good way is something we're playing with for sure.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.960
And then making that easy to being able to like scale up without having no anything.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.620
If you know how to do your own Amazon stuff, then you could do it yourself.

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:38.420
But sometimes, yeah, it's just can I click a button and solve this problem and go away is what people want.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.020
So sure.

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:39.480
Yeah.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.620
And I guess if they're right there in your platform, they can click a button.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.020
You would want to make that possible.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.700
But no, it sounds like a great platform.

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:49.480
And I like the sort of trend back towards like I can mostly work local, but not always.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.620
All right.

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:54.540
So I think we'll leave it there for the data science gigantum conversation.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.340
It's been really interesting.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.540
But before you get out of here, let me ask you the final two questions.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:00.960
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.800
I use PyCharm.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.200
We like PyCharm a lot.

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.220
I especially like, you know, started using PyCharm a long time ago.

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.520
So I've just always used that really.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:13.840
I know a lot of there's a lot of VS Code love right now, but I do love PyCharm.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.520
And their Docker integration has been really convenient for us, too, because, you know, we're building in Docker.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.840
And so what's real nice is we've got like all of our build tooling.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:27.020
So our application that runs in Docker, you know, I didn't have PyCharm connect to that.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:34.800
So when you run a test or want to debug code, you're running it in the actual productionally built, you know, container and everything.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.120
So that's real, real convenient.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.460
So we enjoy that a lot.

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:38.080
That's a good one.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.360
The notable PyPI package?

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.840
Recently, I've been using a new, we use GraphQL for our APIs.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:48.420
That's a way to write an API that is really interesting.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.720
And so Graphene is the big library we've been using a lot.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:57.900
But I started using a new one recently called Ariadne, which is a schema first GraphQL library, which I like a lot.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.600
So you write your schema and it like makes it real easy to just wire everything up.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.580
And it's all asynchronous, which I've been playing a lot with.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.120
That sounds cool.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.580
I love all the new Python 3.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:11.620
I've been really getting into a lot of the asynchronous Python and typing and like mypy.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.260
All that stuff has been awesome.

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:15.080
So I like this library a lot.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.020
I've been playing with it a lot lately.

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:16.860
So it's been good.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:17.820
Oh, that's a good recommendation.

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.720
And I hadn't heard of it.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:18.980
Awesome.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:19.800
All right.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.160
Well, Dean, final call to action.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.880
People want to check out Gigantum and this kind of stuff.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.780
What do you say to them?

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.660
Just, you know, gigantum.com.

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:27.760
Check that out.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:33.940
That's where you go to learn about what it is, to explore people's projects, to just click a button and try it out.

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.600
It's kind of a place to go.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.080
Right on.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.020
All right.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.220
Well, thanks for sharing what you guys are up to.

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.120
It's been good to talk to you.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:40.400
Yeah.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:40.880
Thanks so much.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.360
It's been great.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:41.680
You bet.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:41.980
Bye.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.120

This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.940
Thanks so much for listening.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:52.980
I really appreciate it.

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.760
Now get out there and write some Python code.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:07:15.360
I'll see you next time.
