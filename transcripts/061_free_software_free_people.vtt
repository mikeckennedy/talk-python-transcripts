00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.580
How often do you read some news headline about free speech denied and human rights being suppressed

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.620
and think, that sucks, but there's nothing I can do about it from my distant place?

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.800
I guess you could vote slightly differently in your next election, and maybe, just maybe,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.720
it'll have a small impact in four years' time. Well, if you're a technologist or developer,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.860
you have way more power than you realize. Still, the challenge is, could you use your skills to

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.920
make a difference? Maybe you could remove a layer of surveillance or add a layer of anonymity to

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.460
the affected people? If the answer is yes, and it probably is, actually, then the question becomes,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.340
what would you do, and even should you act? This week on Talk Python To Me, you'll meet Pete Fine,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.160
who spent two years of his life helping others using his technical skills. His story is both

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.080
inspiring and amazing. This is Talk Python To Me, episode 61, recorded May 12, 2016.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:21.400
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.160
and the personalities. This is your host, Michael Kennedy. Follow me on Twitter, where I'm at,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.160
the show on Twitter via at Hired underscore HQ and at Snap underscore CI. Hey, everyone. I have a few

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.040
things to share with you before we talk with Pete. First, one of the listeners suggested that I put all the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.320
episode transcripts on GitHub, and I thought, why didn't I think of that? So now you can find all

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.500
the transcripts at github.com/mikeckennedy slash talk dash python dash transcripts. And of course,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.460
now that there are over 50 hours of interview text online, the question is, what will people do with

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.420
it? Well, almost immediately, Anthony Shaw from Sydney sprinkled some data science dust on them and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.060
answered the burning question of peak Talk Python awesomeness. That's not which show was most awesome,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.400
but rather, which show did I say, oh, that's awesome, the most on? You can check out his GitHub

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.020
gist and a cool graph actually showing this over time. I'll put a link in the show notes.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.540
Now, let's talk with Pete.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.540
Pete, welcome to the show.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.400
Hi, thank you.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.260
We have some really interesting stuff to talk about today. And to be honest, I'm really thrilled

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.040
to talk to you about it because you've really done some amazing work and you've helped a lot of

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.040
people. And I'm excited to dig into it.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.060
Me too. Thank you.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.640
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.960
So before we get into all the work that you've been doing, though, let's just start at the beginning.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.320
Just tell me how you got into Python, how you got into programming. What's your story?

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.560
Yeah, I've been programming since I was probably about 16. I think I took a class in high school,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:15.400
between Pascal and C++ maybe. And then a bit at the university. Maybe about 15 years ago,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.760
somebody who's become a very close friend introduced me to Python at a job I was working at,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.120
modeling interest rate derivatives or something, which is a long time in my past. But once I found

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.080
Python, which is probably like 2002, I just kind of never looked back. 95% of the code I've probably

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.960
written since then has been Python.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.020
Just Python. So once you kind of got into it, you're just like, oh, wait, I found my place. This is it.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.200
Yeah, exactly. It's just like, why would I use anything else? And I can see, I see using other

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.000
languages and I, you know, do a little bit in other things sometimes. But, you know, I've heard that

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.100
Python is the second best language for everything. In the real world, you're kind of trying to do more

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:07.000
than one thing. You're, you know, bringing together a web front end and a database or like a mobile app

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.180
in a search engine or whatever. When you have to start doing more than one thing, you know, or three

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.740
things or four things that having something that's the second best at all of those makes getting that

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.220
total thing you're trying to build much easier. And so, yeah, I've just always kind of stuck using

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.840
Python and I've been really happy, happy with it.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.120
Yeah, you know, it's, you can almost pip install everything, right? You know, like, I need to do that

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.200
thing. Let me try pip install, pi that thing. Oh, look, it worked.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.420
Exactly. The library is great. The ecosystem is great. The community is great. I've gone to PyCon

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:48.960
since, I don't know, 2007 or 8, whatever the last year, the second year in Dallas was. And when it was like

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:57.000
700 people and I want to be part of that community to kind of evolve as a language and, you know, set of

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.260
folks.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.680
Yeah, it's cool to watch it grow, right? And this year it's in Portland and I think they have a pretty

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.640
big location. I don't know what the capacity is, but it's been sold out for a while. And sadly, people send

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.180
me messages and say, Michael, can you help me get, get a ticket? I'm like, I really don't have any

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.180
leverage. I'm sorry. I wish I could get you a ticket.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.700
One of the things that I mean, like about the Python community in particular is, is the kind of

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.200
spirit of, of, of copying and, and doing things yourselves. I mean, there's like, I mean, I can't

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.620
even think probably a dozen regional conferences. Absolutely. I recently moved to Pittsburgh.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.960
Ohio, Ohio, Texas. Yeah. Yeah. I lived in Chicago for many years and never made it to

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.700
high Ohio, but I moved to Pittsburgh recently. And I'm just like, I'm like, Oh, this is like

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.800
close, close by. And so I'm excited. I'm excited to go. I'm excited to go to Portland too, but

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.480
it's cool that like other, you know, languages, other open source things like they don't do that.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.380
They don't kind of spawn these sort of local.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.060
Yeah. They just have the one conference or something like that. Right. Absolutely. Yeah.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.760
So speaking of PyCon, I think that's a good way to segue into how I got to know you. And I

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.900
watched an amazing, inspiring talk that you gave at PyCon 2015. And I'll be sure to link to that in

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:21.960
the show notes. It's on YouTube and it was entitled free software, free people. So give us the background

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.080
on what you were doing at that time. And maybe we can talk later about what you're doing sort of these

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.460
days.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.740
My talk at PyCon last year was called free software, free people. And what's about my time is what's

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.880
called a hacktivist or an internet activist from probably about late 2010 through 2014.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:48.620
Doing everything from organizing protests to helping people circumvent censorship and surveillance all around

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.360
the world, most often in the Middle East for the Arab Spring.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.460
That is super inspiring. That's awesome. Long ago, when I thought about technology, I thought about how it's going to

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.640
open up the doors and make everything great. But there's sort of a there's two sides of technology. In a lot of places,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:15.380
technology is used to stifle people, ideas, and so on. Right. And especially the dictators of the Middle East during the Arab

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.200
spring, for example.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.140
Yeah. For as a technical person as I have a really sort of complicated and sort of I try to be deliberate

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:31.300
about how I use it. And that that ethic was certainly up on play when I was doing this work in the Middle East.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:37.740
Yeah. I mean, so I worked with a group called telecomics, which was basically like an IRC network,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:44.620
which is sort of people probably almost certainly familiar with Slack these days as a group chat, but Slack is modeled after

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:53.820
a much older chat network called IRC, which actually predates the web, goes back to 1994, and has a long history of being

00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:05.040
source of communication support and activist communities. It was some of the first source of news out of

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:13.700
Moscow after the counter coup after the Soviet Union fell, also during Bosnia and Sarajevo. I learned all this stuff later. Like I was just hanging out on free

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:21.120
node with all the other source people for a couple years and then stumbled upon this group of what have become called

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:34.800
hacktivists called telecomics, who ran their own set own network, their own set of servers, mainly located in Sweden, Germany, and was a group of about 200 to 300 humans and machines.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:57.460
That were sort of an active part of this IRC community. And we did everything from like kind of advocacy work, which I mean, like working to change, change and influence policy to technical hacking, like network scanning and helping people use and install tools like Tor and, you know, configure SSL to stuff I like to call media hacking, which was basically getting the

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.460
getting the mainstream press to pay attention to things that we thought, thought were important.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.120
Censorship or surveillance or some kind of the policy, policy positions.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:19.880
Well, to a lot of people, like they hear stuff about encryption or, you know, it's after the whole Snowden thing, it's way higher on people's mind. But before then, it was just like, you know what, that's like some technical mumbo jumbo.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.940
I don't care about this stuff.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.540
Yeah, it's technical mumbo jumbo.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:35.480
But so that's a really actually important role to make people that actually have influence on politics, pay attention and they get it right. Sometimes they get it wrong. Right. We can look at a lot of examples where they get it wrong.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:50.120
Yeah. The stuff we're able to do using using encryption to help people exercise free speech rights in places like Syria and Egypt, where if they got caught, they got, you know, thrown in jails and nobody heard from them and they got beat up.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:10:05.940
Using those same kind of technologies, I think, that our politicians want to, you know, have access to is really scary. Like, because the countries that these people are in had that kind of access.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.620
And we saw what they did with it, right?

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:19.820
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And just that's a, it's not a tool like a gun. It's a tool that tells you where to point your guns. And like that can sometimes be almost more effective means to control.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.920
Right. Or who needs to disappear tomorrow or some other terrible thing like that. Yeah.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:44.080
Yeah. Yeah. And so, you know, I mean, I'm not like a cryptographer. I'm not like even really a big security or network dude. And so like there were those kind of people around telecomics, along with people who were not really technical at all. People who were artists, people who were journalists, people who were just, you know, gardeners. And, you know, like.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.880
They just wanted to help out however they could, right?

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.300
They just want to help out. Exactly.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:53.740
And so kind of putting the, you know, so like putting those skills together, we were able to just help out people.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.480
I mean, really just people came, came to us and asked for, for help saying like, I can't get on Twitter.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.140
Like these terrible things are happening. They're going around my neighborhood and beating people up.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.380
Like I have some pictures and like, I can't get on Twitter. Can you put them on Twitter?

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.480
And so we're like, we have to tell the world about this.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:19.040
Yeah, exactly. And just, it's, it sounds in Egypt, some of exactly actually what we did is just, you know, people found us and just, you know, they couldn't access their Twitter accounts.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:25.940
And we spoke for them. We use our Twitter account to act almost like a proxy, you know, like we were human proxies the same way there were network proxies.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:26.940
Yeah. Yeah.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.300
Yeah.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.460
A little bit of sneaker net almost to cross the air gap or whatever.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:42.720
Yeah. Yeah. There were, there totally were sneaker nets in Syria. Oh my gosh. Yeah. The Syrians like had total, had lots of, some sort of crazy sneaker nets out going on. I don't want to, I didn't really know, know that much about, but you know, also.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:12:11.420
We worked with guys a long time in Syria, like nine, 12 months, you know, and this is like in 2011 and 2012 before things got really terrible there. Like people don't need internet in Syria now. Like that's just not, I mean, it's, it's such a minor part of what it is. But, you know, back then it was like some people were getting beat up. Some people were getting shot at, you know, protests were getting shot at a little bit, but it was, it was, you know, the censorship and surveillance was much more of a problem.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.620
And it wasn't nearly as violent.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:34.880
Sure. Well, back then, just looking from the outside, it feels like there was still a public case to me be made about whether it's bad or not or how bad it is. And now everybody knows that it's bad and they just don't know what to do about it. But it's not like the fact it's bad needs to be told. Like everybody knows it's bad and we don't really know what to do about it, I guess.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:41.400
Yeah. I mean, I don't, I mean, I didn't know what to do about it then either. I mean, like, I just, I didn't have any great,

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.660
political insight to what, what was going on and what should be going on in these guys. It's not my country.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:56.080
People asked for help. Like, this is the thing, you know, like we have this internet and people came and we found each other, you know, in the secret back tunnels.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:02.800
And I was in a position to help and that's what I did.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.260
That's awesome.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:12.740
Yeah. And sometimes, well, I mean, I guess, I don't know. Sometimes people ask for things and we're like, no, that's like not the kind of thing we want to help you with. And like, we, you know, ignored them till they went away.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:18.200
Yeah. I guess you've got to, it has to match your mission, right? You can't just be doing whatever out there.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:32.120
We just telecomics just did communication support. Like we did censorship and surveillance, you know, it was free. Basically, you know, free speech is kind of the driving scene of somebody, you know, people come by and they're like, Hey, can you help us make bombs? We're like, no, we can't go away.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:50.580
It's not that complicated. You know, there's nobody. I'm like, I don't know how to be bothered. What are you guys doing here? Like, just like go, go find some other IRC network and bother them. Like, it's just, yeah. And so you must've gotten the reputation about that's where people to go get help from the outside or whatever. Right. And so they show up.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:56.180
We had, you know, and that was just rare. I mean, it's just like, but mainly it was people asking for help.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:14.060
Ah, wanted VPNs, wanted help setting up tour proxies, help publish anything. You know, I mean, you had some long-term anonymity is complicated and hands-on work. You can't just like give somebody tour and be like, have a nice day.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:25.540
Like there's a lot of ways that, you know, if you have say some photos or some PDFs or whatever, somebody gave you tour and you went on and set up a Twitter account instead of an email account.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:36.920
Like there's a lot of ways you can still give away who you are. It's really, it's like, it's really kind of like the one thing I kind of, I mean, just, it's, it's such a human and machines.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.620
You know, it was, you know, like, like working together, make these things possible.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.720
Like that's when I said, like, you know, there's like 300 humans and bots, like there's websites, there's servers.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:55.100
Like the main server I found out was like a, at, like at the end of all this was a 686 or something.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:00.760
It's like some old, like 16, like, like maybe like six, I don't even remember.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.500
It was an ancient, ancient machine that was running the IRC network.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.020
It's just, it doesn't take.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.400
It's 16 bit.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:06.820
What are you talking about?

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.840
Yeah, I just, I don't know.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:16.820
It was ancient, it was something like ancient 32 bit Linux install that, you know, happened to be located at an ISP data center in Sweden.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:22.700
Because those are some of the people that were like in this, this network of, of folks.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.020
Yeah.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.360
Somebody's like, Hey, I got a server.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.180
Yeah, sure.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:25.880
Somebody's like, sure.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.580
I have an old server.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.160
Like there was no money involved.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.820
There was no mailing address.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.440
There's no like board of directors.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:39.580
Like literally it's just a bunch of people like bootstrapped an IRC network and started hanging out on it and like put up some websites and found some friends.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:39.980
Yeah.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.360
Yeah.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.000
Yeah.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.140
And so the appeal for me for finding that coming from working in open source communities, I was like, Oh, I get how this works.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.940
Like I get this, how this works.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.840
Like you want to build a project, like you just go find some people and you go do it.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:05.880
And like the things that succeed, you know, like you can't, can't get any of these, whether it's like an open source project or like helping people evade censorship.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:16.940
Like it takes a lot of hands, but you can't like the things that succeed or not, it's not merely just good ideas or good technology, but like there's people involved here too.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:22.580
Like that's the one thing like in three years or so of doing this like full time.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.080
And then some, I didn't have a job.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:32.220
Like I had a couple of periods where I worked like, you know, 16 hours a day for like three or four weeks on end.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:39.140
And like the one lesson I take away from this is just how important the people are in this.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.100
Like, like your users, your collaborators, like just people had great ideas.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.460
And like, I had great ideas.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.420
I'm like, I couldn't find anybody to help me like, so those things didn't get done.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:52.980
And so like I went and helped somebody else and that's just crucial.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:53.380
Yeah.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:59.160
I think it's easy to confuse our use and need of privacy with others.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:16:59.380
Right.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:07.760
So for example, if I want to go to Starbucks and I'd want to feel a little bit better about using the public Wi-Fi, I might fire up a VPN to go do something.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:13.960
But that's not the same as like the consequence of me getting that wrong is pretty low.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.960
Exactly.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.900
Yeah.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.440
Versus if I'm in somewhere where there's actual turmoil.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:19.840
Yeah.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:34.520
Turmoil or just police state or surveillance state or like a government that is listening, you know, to what you do on those open networks and how often they go send, you know, guys with guns and nightsticks around to your house.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.860
If you do it wrong.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.100
Yeah.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.080
Yeah.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.420
Yeah.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.340
That's definitely a higher consequence.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.100
Yeah.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.620
So tell us some stories.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.180
Sure.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.900
There's a couple of things that you talked about in your talk that were really interesting.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.820
One involving modems and another involving like filtering, monitoring.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.040
Sure.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.740
Hardware.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:18:08.600
So I stumbled across telecomics in January of 2011, maybe about a week before the Egyptian revolution kind of got publicly rolling.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.760
So people may remember the Jan 25 hashtag.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.700
So I kind of stumbled on telecomics about Jan 20.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.820
You know, so at that point, Twitter was blocked in Egypt.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:26.220
We knew there was kind of various degrees of surveillance, but like things were still largely operable.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:35.780
And so this, this was this period where we get people who would find our IRC network and come on and like share stories and photos with us about what was, what's happening.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.260
And we would retweet them using our like collective telecomics Twitter account.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.460
It's kind of acting like human proxies.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:51.300
And some of those people would stick around and we would help them set up technical proxies like Tor kind of VPNs or even just basic HTTP proxies.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.500
I got involved working on a ham radio project.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:12.380
So we didn't see, foresee that the, you know, entire internet was going to go down, like, which happened basically on January 28th that the Egyptian government like turned off 95% of the routes into the country.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.160
So we didn't see that.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:21.900
I'm not going to say we foresaw that, but like just, we were throwing like a lot of, a lot of things against the wall and some of them stuck and some of them didn't.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.660
And somebody threw out the idea of a ham radio.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.920
So amateur, amateur, like long wave or short wave radio.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.980
If they're going to turn off the internet, let's just go old school on them, right?

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.360
Yeah.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.160
And so I don't, I'm not a ham.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:44.220
Some of these guys, guys were, but like I had an interest just in amateur radio and pirate radio and like from a media theory and like communications history perspective.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.460
And so I was like, okay, well, I'm new here.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.500
Like, let me try work, like helping out with this.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.960
And so I ran around the internet and tried to find people to help.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.780
Like I Googled up ham forums and we tweeted about it.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.700
And I don't try to remember what else.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.200
Oh, I ran around, I found like other IRC networks.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.980
Like there was like a amateur radio channel on Freenode and like Fnet and like kind of just different.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.500
I just kind of like dug around for a couple of days and like bugged people to come help.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:17.120
And like, you know, it went from five people to 130 in like three days or something like that.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.200
Yeah.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.140
Well, and part of it was, is just like spectacle of it.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.100
If just, this is like, Hey, this is this cool thing we're doing.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.780
Like if we're just like, you know, like that people are like, Oh my gosh,

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.420
they're going to use amateur radio to save Egypt.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.160
That's so cool.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.880
Like here, we'll write a little blog about them or write a press story about them.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.400
Like there was value in that as well.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.460
I mean, like it was legitimately helpful, but like, you know, that aspect in just getting like,

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.840
Hey, like, come on, get some more people.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.780
Come help.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.500
Like, you know, it just, right.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:54.180
So like, it turned out not, not to be, not to be actually the most best way of kind of maintaining

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.980
contact in, in Egypt.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.060
There were only probably about 130 licensed radio operators in Egypt.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.900
They were mostly the ex-military, like that just technology just kind of wasn't, wasn't available.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:21.000
This episode is brought to you by hired hired is a two-sided curated marketplace that connects

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.580
the world's knowledge workers to the best opportunities.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.700
Each offer you receive has salary and equity presented right up front, and you can view

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.060
the offers to accept or reject them before you even talk to the company.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:36.200
Typically candidates receive five or more offers within the first week, and there are no obligations

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:36.800
ever.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.960
Sounds awesome.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.380
Doesn't it?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.060
Well, did I mention the signing bonus?

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.460
Everyone who accepts a job from hired gets a thousand dollars signing bonus.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.220
And as Talk Python listeners, it gets way sweeter.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:51.940
Use the link hired.com slash Talk Python To Me and hired will double the signing bonus to $2,000.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.060
Opportunity's knocking.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.500
Visit hired.com slash Talk Python To Me and answer the call.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:06.300
Yeah, a whole bunch of like cool other stuff spun out of it.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.560
People working on all sorts of different projects.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.200
We sent a lot of fax spam.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.140
These were cool.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.560
So like, you know, both before.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.200
So basically, they cut off the fiber.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.900
And so, you know, there's no cell.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.780
There's no internet.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.180
There's no text messaging.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:29.200
The only thing they left out that was working was landline phones, which in Egypt isn't like

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.480
actually a lot of the rest of the world are like core infrastructure for everything for

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:40.340
the military to keeping power plants running and just like, yeah, like copper line phones,

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.720
like just turning that off like actually breaks totally everything.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:23:05.960
So yeah, we did things like Googled up the numbers of fax machines at like hospitals and universities and like coffee and copy shops, put a list, list of these things together and put together a PDF in English and Arabic, like explaining who we were, and that we were here to help.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:15.100
And, you know, instructions for like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know,

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:27.680
getting, you know, getting shot with tear gas and, and put this PDF out there with a list and basically got volunteers to go through on free international faxing services and like upload the thing and click accept, you know, and send it, send it to all of these places.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240
Yeah.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:29.240
Yeah.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:36.240
I mean, just kind of using whatever, whatever technology we had had at hand, those things worked well.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:41.540
We ran, oh, about 500 dial-up modem lines.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:45.160
So again, the only thing working was, I mean, this was crazy to me.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.420
So this is like 2011.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:49.320
Half of Egypt was on dial-up modems.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:56.260
Like it was about, yeah, about a quarter, a quarter was on like wired ethernet.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.720
About a quarter was wifi.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.360
About half was on dial-up modems.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.100
The other strange thing was that the local ISPs didn't peer with each other.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:13.160
So there were like three or four ISPs in, in Egypt and they didn't actually exchange packets in Egypt.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:24.960
They sent their packets like up to, to like Cyprus or whatever, like where the, the, there was a data center where they're, you know, the fiber cable and they crossed.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.820
And then they came back to Egypt and went to the other ISP.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:35.840
So when they turned off the like two or three pieces of fiber, the ISPs were isolated from each other within Egypt because they didn't exchange, exchange traffic.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.360
Right.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.120
So it wasn't just getting out to the world.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.280
It was even communicating within the country still.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.820
Internal communications.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.160
Right.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.700
And like, we have this idea that the internet is like this redundant thing and it's kind of like, you know, right.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.580
It was designed to survive nuclear strikes or whatever.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:56.520
And like, you go start poking around the networks of some of, some of the other places in the world.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.940
And you just go like, what the heck is this?

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:06.140
This is just like both built from components and routers and stuff that we just would go like, where'd they get this eBay?

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:06.600
And yes.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.220
And the answer is yes.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.960
They bought an eBay, like just random, whatever random old stuff they can afford and get to get their hands on.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:32.480
That is also architected with just kind of totally different, really like political objectives built into the network, like built into the infrastructure of the network, that these networks are built, built centralized so they can be monitored and surveilled and censored and turned off, like and turned on.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:32.800
Yeah.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.880
A political network topology.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.540
Yeah.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:41.540
And that's just such a different approach and attitude than we think the internet should be built.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.440
And in some places, more or less is.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.220
Wow.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.040
That's pretty wild.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:55.180
So speaking of, you know, controlling stuff and looking at it, there's some really interesting stuff that came out with some network surveillance hardware.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:55.900
Yeah.

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:56.940
From a company.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.480
Was that in the U.S., that company?

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.160
Yeah.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:08.640
So in Syria, we started working in Syria in the summer of 2011, maybe about three months in July, maybe about three months after the protests started.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.840
And the first thing we started doing was NMAPing the networks.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.520
So basically, like NMAP is a network scanner.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:22.140
So basically, like it pings all the ports and all the, you know, you give it some list of IP address, range of IP addresses, and it pings all the ports.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:27.240
And it, like, tries to fingerprint what's there and tells you, like, oh, hey, here's a web server.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.380
Here's a printer.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.000
Here's an FTP server.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.380
Here's another printer.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.480
Here's a webcam.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.600
Like, you know, and so basically, you can go get what IP blocks are assigned to Syria.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.060
Like, that's kind of just public information from the registries.

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:42.880
Yeah.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:49.800
And so we scanned the whole country over the course of, like, I think it was about six weeks.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.780
It's like maybe about.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.000
Wow.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.400
So you built, like, a network map of all of Syria, basically.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:54.960
Yeah.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.420
Yeah.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.740
With kind of, like, follow-on probing.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.500
Like, so you go, NMAP is a kind of, like, pretty coarse tool.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:09.860
So this is maybe, like, a dozen people over the course of about four or six weeks with, mainly with NMAP and some other kind of tools and kind of some manual probing.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:18.360
And that's, like, now there's tools out there now that you could do this, like, by yourself from a single machine in EC2 in, like, three days.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:19.760
Wow.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:28.140
Like, the tooling is five years later and the tooling has just gotten, like, sure, you can scan, like, that much space, like, so much more efficiently just because the software's gotten better.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:28.720
Yeah.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.220
And the cloud and the network speeds and all that, right?

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:31.720
Yeah.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:41.020
I mean, these guys had, like, data center class network speeds, but just the software, like, there's things called ZMAP and MassScan now that do the same thing that NMAP does.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.540
But, like, same hardware.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.360
It's just the software.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.680
Like, it's just way better to do this, which is crazy to me.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.960
But we found a whole bunch of interesting things, a whole lot of cable modems.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.060
Cable modems with the default password.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.140
Admin username and password, password.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:03.920
One of the things the guys did was change the DNS settings on these cable modems.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.680
This was done with curl scripts, actually.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.740
I didn't write this.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.840
I don't write any curl, but, like, these guys did it with curl scripts.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:27.380
So they changed the DNS settings so that when people in Syria would go, on their cable modems, would go to Google.com or Facebook or whatever, they would get sent instead to a network of 19 web servers that the telecomics guys put up that had a page in Arabic and English that said,

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.460
your connection is being monitored.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.600
You're under surveillance.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.180
Here are some tools, like, to help and an explanation.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:47.420
And so, yeah, and, like, they flipped this on and, like, took, like, I don't know, 40 or 60% of the web traffic in Syria for the, you know, two days or whatever they had this thing going.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.720
Yeah, and it's just, this was the kind of stuff we could do.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:57.440
Like, this was the kind of stuff we could do because we didn't have anybody, money.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:03.960
Like, who do you, who do you, it's just kind of right at the border of legal and not a lot and, like, legitimate.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:11.100
Like, and, like, we were able to kind of skirt that border because we didn't, we didn't do certain other things like take money.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.580
Gone are the days of tweaking your server, merging your code, and just hoping it works in your production environment.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:41.520
With SnapCI's cloud-based, hosted, continuous delivery tool, you simply do a get push and they auto-detect and run all the necessary tests through their multi-stage pipelines.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.020
Something fails, you can even debug it directly in the browser.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:52.980
With a one-click deployment that you can do from your desk or from 30,000 feet in the air, Snap offers flexibility and ease of mind.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.800
Imagine all the time you'll save.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:01.600
Thanks, SnapCI for sponsoring this episode by trying them for free at snap.ci slash talkpython.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.960
And so when I talked about earlier about sort of being very technical, like, like, this was really deliberate.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:21.100
Like, there's a lot of thought and a lot of discussion about how to do this safely.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.120
Should we do this at all?

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:34.600
Like, from a technical level, from an ethical level that I feel like, you know, characterizes, yeah, some of the, some of the, you know, I feel like there's, there's reasons I talked about it at the PyCon community.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:49.180
Like, that, that there has been an interest in broader kind of social issues and political issues in the Python community and the PyCon talks for a long time.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.920
And I entirely admit that I probably pushed that further than, than anybody else.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.760
And I'm grateful for that, that opportunity.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.180
And people seem to appreciate it.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:07.540
But I feel like that the Python community is far more thoughtful about those sort of issues than any other technical community I've participated in.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.760
I think there's a down-to-earth-ness of those, those folks.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.200
It's awesome.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.080
Do you want to tell the story about the network monitoring stuff with BlueCode?

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:17.560
Sure.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:36.900
One of the other things we found, while poking around inside the Syrian networks were a dozen unsecured FTP servers that were basically like the file storage engine on these network traffic monitoring and shaping devices called, by a company, made a manufacturer by a company called BlueCode.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.040
She was based in California.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.300
And so you can think of these, so these things could, like ran at the speed of the fiber.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:53.520
So these, these were actually Windows machines, but they had like a custom ASIC, like a custom chip in hardware to process some like 200 different kinds of traffic.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:32:03.060
So HTTP traffics, Skype traffic, Windows file sharing traffic, like you name it, like, and sort of analyze what was happening.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.520
And then either both control the bandwidth.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:15.660
So in their marketing docs, they talked about like, don't just outright block YouTube and Facebook games because then your employees, because they're made for mainly corporate use.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:15.960
Right.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.520
These are like enterprise devices to keep people.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.100
And they're right.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.840
These are totally like enterprise firewall, firewall grade stuff.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:30.160
And so you don't outright block YouTube because then your employees get pissed, but you just like really degrade the bandwidth.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:37.300
And so they get, you know, or same thing with games, like, you don't make them, you just make them like really painful to play.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.060
So they just get frustrated and go back to work.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.980
Whereas if you outright block it, like they get upset.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:51.180
And so, I mean, this is kind of, you know, this is in the corporate environment, but I think it's kind of gives you a sense of the sort of censorship of which these things are capable.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.580
Put these in the hands of a dictator and turn the knobs differently, right?

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.440
Exactly.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:03.760
And so we found about a dozen of these machines with their log files just sitting on open, unpassworded FTP server.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:11.820
And so these were basically like web logs for like all of the web traffic for Syria for like a week.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.860
A week was like 64 gigs raw of web.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:28.280
And so it basically has the source IP, has the URL they're trying to visit, cookies, accept or deny whether the proxy like blocked it or let the traffic through, things like that.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.600
For like the whole country, like the whole country.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.480
We found these things.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.940
And, you know, in digging through them, we found things like the words like Israel or proxy were blocked.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:44.740
Specific page, Facebook pages that were specific to Syrian like activists and like justice groups were blocked.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.360
There's a whole lot of porn that was actually allowed through.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.160
And so we have this idea of the media.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:56.060
No, I mean, we have this idea of this Mideast as sort of very sort of uniformly conservative and censored.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.400
It's not like that at all.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:06.640
And like sort of what's accessible on the Syrian Internet is really different than what's accessible on the Saudi Arabian Internet or on the Iranian Internet or on the Turkish Internet.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:18.840
Both in terms of local political issues, you know, specific to that country, like more regional issues, as well as like sex and violence and, you know, all the other kind of crazy things that are on the Internet.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:19.480
Yeah.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:25.220
And so Syria had had a long reputation being actually quite liberal for porn.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.820
But, you know, there were a whole bunch of kind of political stuff that was specifically blocked.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.200
Yeah.

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.960
It was more about protecting the government.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.200
They didn't really care what you did or something like this.

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:34.360
Yeah.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.040
Yeah.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:35.640
I just don't agree.

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:35.900
Right.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.500
And so it's like I said, it's different in different countries.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:39.700
Yeah.

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:47.500
And so these eventually got leaked that some of the other telecomics agents had like done some analysis on these things and just like splashed them out on the Internet.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.400
And so I wrote a story for Slashdot.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:53.560
I have been a proud reader of Slashdot since probably like 1997.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.980
You know, back when I started like playing around with Linux in college.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.740
And so I thought this was cool.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.760
And so I wrote a post for Slashdot.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.900
And so this is the kind of like media hacking that we did.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:13.700
And this got picked up by, I don't even remember, the Washington Post, eventually the Wall Street Journal.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:23.880
And so like I wrote this story for Slashdot and said like, hey, look, here's this like digital evidence that these companies hardware was being used by the Syrian government to censor and survey the net.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.600
Like there's export controls on Syria.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.460
Like there was an embargo.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.140
You can't sell anything, anything to the Syrian government.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:30.420
Right.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:30.820
Absolutely.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:35.400
Somehow these devices that were built and built in California have wound up their way in Syria.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.480
Like what has happened?

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:43.740
And so the company like first denies to Slashdot that there's like any evidence that this is their equipment at all.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:49.380
And we're like, it says like right in the header of the log, like it's well-known format, like blue code.

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.940
And here's like the device ID.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.440
You know, we sent.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.580
Here's its serial number.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.040
Yeah.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:59.980
Like we sent, like we sent, we had the telecomics agents, like the Syrians send traffic.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.740
Like out to servers we controlled.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:12.660
And like we could basically see like how, what the headers get injected, you know, like by, by the log, the box itself.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:20.940
Like we had like, you know, from these IP addresses, you know, like we'd see this, the, the, all the traffic series being force routed through, through these proxies.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:26.660
And this is, and so they're denying this is this, it gets picked up by the Washington post.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:35.700
And then maybe about two week and a half later, I'm at a human rights conference and I get a call from a reporter at the wall street journal.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:42.140
And she says, I've been on the phone with blue coat for the last week, alternately yelling at them and begging them to stop lying to me.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.680
Do you have anything you would like to add?

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.120
I was like, sure, sure.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:54.960
And so it kind of explained much, much of it explained to, to you, like kind of what these things were and we found them and what, what they're capable of.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:37:02.240
So, you know, blue coat advertised itself as being capable of distinguishing between updates to your Facebook wall and Farmville.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.280
It's a pretty fine, like, this is not just like, oh, it's HTTP traffic to this host name.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.640
Right.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.920
It's, it's looking inside the packets in some ways and things like this.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.780
Yeah, exactly.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.560
And the stream inside the stream of packets and doing contextual analysis.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:24.020
And so what we also found out was that these machines were phoning home to the company headquarters, not only for like monitoring services.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.520
So like they had a built in heartbeat monitor, but also for collaborative filtering.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:40.940
So like when they saw some traffic that the local proxy couldn't classify, it would send it off to the headquarters run some like other algorithms on it and give us rules back in like, like 300 milliseconds.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.760
It's like pretty low, low latency.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.640
Yeah.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:50.120
But so the kicker of this is, is that blue coat, had they been paying attention to their internal logs, would have clearly seen these boxes where it's Syria.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.260
And so, right.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.960
Like, because they're getting traffic, like to their internal services coming from these, these machines.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:03.940
And so they just have this incentive not to look because they're the export controls saying no economic activity.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:14.240
And so, you know, if it's known that they block things from these countries, like there's less resale market, there's less black market, like they're providing this service.

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.520
They're not supposed to be doing that.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.220
And so like, they just don't even want to look.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.740
They just don't even want to know, you know, where, where these things are.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:26.000
Well, it's kind of like, gosh, what the Italian group was, was that hacking team?

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.740
Hacking team.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:27.120
Yeah.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:27.640
Yeah.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.660
When it comes unglued, it's a serious PR nightmare, right?

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.100
Like this can't be good for them.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:33.440
Right.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:33.780
So.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.840
And so this was right.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.240
Exactly.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:41.400
And so there's eventually this, this story in, in the front page of the Wall Street Journal and the company admits, yes, this is our stuff.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.240
And like, we're so we should have known.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.180
And like the machines were actually destined for the government of Iraq.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:52.300
I don't know why that's better for them to use for, for, for, this is 20, 2011.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.980
I don't know what for them to use for censorship.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.580
Okay.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:54.860
Whatever.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:39:03.440
Some of the other telecomics agents worked in Brussels in the headquarters of the European Union.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.580
They were like legislative age in the European parliament.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:18.460
And they lobbied to have the EU pass technology export controls for Syria so that, you know, this couldn't, this stuff couldn't get right.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.280
You know, like you mentioned, hacking team and Italian companies.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.240
So that this kind of equipment couldn't be sold by EU members to, to Syria.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.140
December of, of that year, they passed that.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.540
And that was the first time the EU has ever passed this kind of technology export controls.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.980
That's awesome that you guys made that kind of difference, right?

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.540
Yeah.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:34.980
Yeah.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:46.800
And so like, yeah, I mean, and so there's kind of this like loose chain of maybe like 50 people from, you know, over the course of six months, like that nobody really like intended to do this.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.300
We all did wrong and like sort of picked up the parts we were found interesting.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:40:00.460
Like the folks in Brussels, like they're not, they don't run NMAPs, you know, like, like they lobby legislatures to great effect.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:07.040
And it's, you know, we're able to change international law, this kind of like sketchy group of hackers with no money.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:11.020
This ragtag group of folks that just organized an IRC, right?

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:11.700
That's awesome.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.180
So the U.S.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:22.240
Like it's like a year and a half later in like 2014, finally levied some fines on the reseller.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:30.160
There was some company and some dudes in Dubai who supposedly bought these for Bluecoat and, you know, illicitly shipped them on.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.640
And these dudes paid like a fine.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.540
And the company like gets, gets a pass.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.640
Yeah, but the PR still has to sting, right?

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.100
So it's not a full pass.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:39.820
Yeah, yeah.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.640
They got sold.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.660
They got bought by some like private equity fund.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:47.760
And like, you know, it's been, they, they, people have found their stuff like all over the world now.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:56.140
And it's, it's really been helpful to raise attention of this kind of before this all before Snowden, all, all this stuff before Snowden.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:56.800
Right.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:08.660
So do you think this is a good example of the type of ways that what the U.S. government's trying to pull gets out of control and has like unintended consequences?

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.580
Like, oh, we just need a backdoor for us.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.260
Oh, yeah.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.940
There is no such thing as a backdoor just for us.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.200
There's no, there's no such thing as a backdoor just for us.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.880
But we'll keep the key really safe.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:24.300
The FBI mandated that Google build them a backdoor in like 2010.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.200
It's called Project Aurora.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.160
And the Chinese hacked it and used it to go after their own people.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.400
Google has better security engineers than the FBI does.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.360
Oh, my gosh.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.340
Oh, my gosh.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:41.860
Like, yeah, there's no, and you know, and they still get, get hacked by the Chinese.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.060
Like these things are not, there's no backdoor just for you.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.620
There's no backdoor just for you.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.800
One thing to build a safe wall, it's another thing to build a safe door, right?

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.600
These are like different levels of hard, I guess.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.180
Yeah.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.100
Yeah.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.940
It's like, you know, it's so funny.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:56.540
It's so funny.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.440
Like, I went to a hardware store.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.080
My mother was visiting actually, and she wanted to buy, I had just bought a house, which is an experience for me.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.000
But we went to the hardware store, and she wanted me to buy a new lock for my door.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.480
I was like, okay, that seems like a reasonable thing.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.140
I bought a new house.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.560
Like, I don't know who has keys to the old, old house.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.320
I bought a new lock.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.760
Yeah, I did that when I got a house.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.640
Yeah, sure.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.960
And so we go, and we talk to salesmen.

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.960
He's like, okay, well, this is, you know, really like the good lock that we recommend.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.360
And I was like, oh, I picked that.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.120
I was at Hope.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.060
It's like a hacker convention in New York, and they have a little lockpicking station.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.160
I was like, and I mean, I've done this maybe three or four times.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.460
I was like, oh, yeah, I picked that lock.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:34.800
I was like, all right, cool.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.100
But I mean, I bought it anyway, right?

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:42.080
Like, I mean, it's just, you know, it's different levels of security.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.700
But just, you know, like, it's the door to my house.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:49.380
It's not a door to, like, everybody's private information.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.120
Like, what does that mean?

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:55.860
Like, your medical information, your financial information, the letters you wrote to your spouse.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.100
Yeah, well, the thing is, you...

00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:58.700
It's just everything.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.540
It's just everything.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.160
Yeah, yeah.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:06.260
We have these sort of concepts that we map up into the digital world, I think, as at least

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.980
you're speaking and trying to speak for the non-technical politician types and law enforcement

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:11.680
and so on.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.000
And you think, I can get access to your lock on your door.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.360
So why can't I just have a lock on this other thing?

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.840
But the problem is, if you hack that, you hack everybody in the world.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.660
You don't break into one house.

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:26.300
You don't break into every house in the world when you break into it, right?

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:26.720
Yeah.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.760
It's crazy.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.800
The NSA had a dual mandate.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.540
The NSA had a dual mandate.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.940
They had a mandate for both cyber surveillance and cybersecurity.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:40.140
And they have entirely neglected the latter, you know?

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.660
I mean, they have hired...

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:48.020
I mean, I've sat in classes with dudes, you know, like Python, high-level, you know, advanced

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:55.140
Python pun trainings with guys who worked for contractors in Maryland and weren't allowed

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.320
to tell the rest of us what they did.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:57.920
Yeah.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:05.300
And, you know, by hiring those guys and putting them on offense, like, they have both starved

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:09.660
the market in terms of, like, knowledgeable people, but also, like, they had a mandate

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.600
to play defense.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:15.380
All these problems and these bugs, they're finding, like, they should be closing them.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.800
They should have been fixing those.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.640
They should have been...

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.120
Instead, they want to rule the world.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.120
Instead, they want access to everything.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.280
And as a result, now everybody has access to everything.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:27.100
I totally agree with you that that is a serious problem.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:34.400
And I think the U.S. and Western Europe, but especially the U.S., has more to lose than they

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.960
have to gain by being able to access stuff.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:42.760
So if the U.S. can break into other people's things and those people break into the U.S.'s

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:48.540
things, like, there's more IP and technical stuff that we have to lose than we're ever going

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.080
to gain from getting other places, I think.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:51.760
Yeah.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.520
I don't think it really makes sense, but, you know.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:45:02.500
I think these are people who grew up the political children of the people who, you know, came up with

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:03.460
mad.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.240
I don't know how old you are.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.840
Remember, like, mutually assured destruction?

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.040
Like, these...

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:07.040
Yeah.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.040
Like, these...

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:15.360
I think that whoever came up with what passes for cyber surveillance and security policy,

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:19.420
like, I think, I think, like, that stuff didn't make any sense either.

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.600
Yeah.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.000
Like, like, wait, so we're all going to die?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.660
That's better.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.380
And I feel like, like, I feel like that this is somehow, like, that these people are, like,

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.780
the digital version, like, children of that.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:29.980
Yeah.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:30.780
That craziness.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.480
Like...

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.860
You're giving me, like, flashbacks.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.400
It makes me really sad, you know?

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.520
As, like, somebody who loves the internet and loves what we do with the internet, like,

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:46.060
it makes me so sad that people just treat it as something to be ravaged and pillaged and,

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.680
like, controlled.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:54.540
You know, like, I feel like one of the lessons from telecomics is, like, that we can use this

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:59.300
technology to, like, like, get together and make cool stuff and do beautiful things and,

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:05.600
like, like, actually make a difference in the physical world and in the lives of people like

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:11.080
ourselves and each other and the people who need help, like, that just in a way that is

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:11.800
very rewarding.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:16.820
I mean, it's just, it's very, it's very direct to have been able to put these skills

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:22.120
that I've cultivated for such a long time, like, in direct service of what, what I believe

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:27.500
when, you know, like, I felt just kind of so politically impotent or just, like, disconnected.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:28.640
Like, I just didn't care.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.880
Like, I just didn't, like, pay attention to what happened in, in mainstream politics and,

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.300
like, just to be able to do stuff.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.520
I mean, that's the same ethic that's drawn me to, to working on open source.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.440
It's just that, like, we can go out and actually build stuff and things get better.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:48.560
Like, that's such a different, it's so rare we get to have that experience.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.380
It's a very different life view, right?

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:53.180
Like, just to think that that can be a thing, right?

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.520
Like, your view of the world is so different if that is your view of the world, right?

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.400
Yeah, exactly.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.060
Exactly.

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:04.420
And, like, just that's, you know, at the end of the day, like, I just, I don't, I don't do

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.380
this activism stuff anymore.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.200
Like, it just kind of, like, it took over my life.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.400
I just, like, it took all my money.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.100
It, like, did bad things for relationships and my health.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:18.720
And, like, it's just doing this, like, as a full-time and then some job, you know, like,

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.680
that much, it's just not sustainable.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.260
Right.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.520
And I feel okay about that.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:29.720
I feel like I had, like, this, this, like, like, the world and my, my, my, you know, the

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.560
world's needs and my interests and abilities kind of, like, aligned and then they sort of

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:34.280
passed on.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.600
And, like, I'm grateful for that.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:35.700
That's awesome.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.000
That have had that opportunity.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.720
It sounds a little like people go into the Peace Corps to, like, take a few years and, like,

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.560
dedicate themselves to something.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.660
This is kind of a, sounds a little like an unofficial version of that in the technical world.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.760
A little bit, maybe.

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:50.940
Something like that.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:59.000
You know, I look back on, on that and just how the Middle East, you know, what has happened

00:47:59.000 --> 00:47:59.820
there since.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.420
It just, yeah, I mean, I don't think anybody saw what was, this was going to look like.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:07.760
And if I did, like, I mean, it just, you know, like I said, people just ask, ask for help.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:13.660
And, like, when I think about the lasting impact, like, I still get, like, emails from people

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:18.120
who, like, see, like, documentaries I was in or, like, find all new articles.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.060
And they're like, oh, teach me to be the greatest hacker in the world.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:21.880
I'm going to break into everything.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.020
I'm like, I'm not that kind of hacker.

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.640
And, you know, I also get, like, more.

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.700
I just connect people, man.

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.260
Leave me alone.

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.000
This is not me.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.120
Yeah, exactly.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:28.600
I do.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.420
That's all I do.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:35.440
To people who are more, have more kind of interest and skills kind of more, more aligned with my

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.100
own, and my own methods.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:42.880
And just to have, inspire people to do cool stuff.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.620
Like, you don't have to let it take over your life.

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.080
And you don't have to, like, do things that are big and dramatic.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.560
Like I said, I moved to Pittsburgh pretty recently.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.680
And I'm involved in starting a pedestrian activism group here.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.000
Yeah.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.720
So why don't, we're getting near the end of the show.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.200
Maybe just take a moment or two and tell people, like, what you're up to these days.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:58.900
Yeah, sure.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.220
So I moved to Pittsburgh and I'm starting this pedestrian activism group, which is, like,

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:07.220
way less earth-shaking and daunting and kind of more close to my heart.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.040
But, like, I set them up a website.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.140
I set them up a Twitter.

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.820
I helped them set them up.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.740
Email at, you know, ourdomain.org.

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:20.500
And just, this is just, you know, like, to help facilitate things, what would otherwise

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.420
be a Facebook group.

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:25.480
Just kind of, like, most of the people I'm listening, you'd probably go set up a domain and set up

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.160
email routing.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.040
To be able to go out and do that for some, like, local neighborhood.

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.380
We're not, like, a non-profit.

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:34.760
We're just, like, there's, like, four of us and we meet once a month or every other month

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.760
and we take a walk.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:41.440
Just to be able to go do that basic technical work is so helpful.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:41.960
That's awesome.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:42.380
Yeah.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:43.300
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:47.980
It sounds like you find people and charities that are trying to make a difference and you

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:48.960
give them a bigger lever.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:49.640
Yeah.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.920
Than they would otherwise have, right?

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.320
Yeah.

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.200
And I just, you know, I'm totally, I'll totally admit it.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.440
Like, I lever the things that I care about and I think I can be useful about.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.280
You can't lever everything, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do something.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:04.920
And there's a real difference between, like, being that lever and doing that work and, like,

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.240
donating is not a substitute for that.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.580
Donating is good and, like, organizations like the EFF do, like, really good work and they

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.340
need, and the Tor Project, like, need money for that.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:18.980
But, like, I just personally feel like that we have an individual responsibility to actually

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:20.100
do things as well.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:20.960
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.580
And you've definitely lived up to that.

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.260
Thanks.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.140
Some of the stuff you've done.

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.360
So that's very cool.

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:25.840
Thank you.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.040
Very cool.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.640
All right, Pete.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:33.180
I normally ask people two questions on the way out the door, but, so I'll go ahead and

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:33.780
throw them out your way.

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:34.120
Sure.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:34.740
Sure, that's great.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:38.040
They seem a little anticlimactic compared to the awesome stuff we've covered.

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:44.680
So you must have a unique view into the Python world, and there's over 80,000 packages on

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.420
PyPI now.

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.860
So what one do you know?

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:47.680
I know it's incredible.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.200
It's like 300 a day or every few days.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.560
Not updates, but new, right?

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:53.900
Yeah.

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:58.100
So are there ones that maybe you think are not well-known that you should tell people?

00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.380
Like, what's awesome?

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:05.140
Working as a freelance developer, I will straight up say Django pays my bills, and I'm really

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.280
grateful for that.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:10.300
stuff that is fun for me these days is PySpark.

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:10.980
Okay.

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.280
Yeah.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.220
Some big data stuff.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:12.720
Very cool.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.020
Yeah.

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:13.340
Yeah.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:13.500
Yeah.

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:17.800
Which is, you know, that's, that's my background is that, but you know, when you, when you work

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.940
as a freelancer, you build a lot of websites and I get to do some of the other, the other

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.260
big data stuff as well.

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.240
But yeah.

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:23.360
Yeah.

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:23.560
Yeah.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:23.840
Awesome.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:28.420
And then if, when you edit your code, your Python code, what editor do you use?

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.020
I have two.

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.440
I use a wing IDE.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.160
Okay.

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:31.440
Yeah.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.020
And have been for a number of years.

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:36.400
It's kind of a little such character, but has some of the best kind of code.

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.520
navigation and completion specifically for Python.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.440
Yeah.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.280
I've heard that about it.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:41.800
Yeah.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.360
It's just, it's just awesome.

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:46.100
And in the shell, Nano.

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.880
I like Nano a lot.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.040
Really.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.420
I actually like Nano too.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:50.680
Yeah.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.640
People laugh at, people laugh at me.

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.000
They're like, you must use Emacs.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.040
You must use, yeah.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.200
And I'm like, no, I like Nano.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.820
Cause like, I just want to get stuff done.

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:02.740
And I just, when editing things in the shell, it's just because I, it's small and I just need

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.300
to be quick and get it done and get it fixed with.

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:07.100
And I don't want to have to think about how to quit my editor.

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.860
I wanted to say right at the bottom, here's how you quit.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.160
Like, yeah.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.380
So, Nano.

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.300
Okay, cool.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:18.320
Well, you know, thank you so much for taking the time to share these stories.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:23.340
Hopefully it's inspired people to do some stuff because it's very cool what you did.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.660
And it sounds like you made a real difference.

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.680
Thank you so much.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.180
It means a lot.

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:27.280
You bet.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:27.560
Yeah.

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:28.220
See you later.

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:28.640
All right.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:28.940
Take care.

Staying with my voice.

00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.620
There's no norm that I can fill within.

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:00.840
Haven't been sleeping.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.440
I've been using lots of rest.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:05.300
I'll pass the mic back to who rocked it best.
