00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.600
At PyCon 2017, Jake Vander Plaats gave a great keynote where he said Python is a mosaic.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.740
He described how Python is stronger and growing because it's being adopted and used by people

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.500
with diverse technical backgrounds.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.040
In this episode, we're adding to that mosaic by diving into how Python is being used in

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.640
the architecture, engineering, and construction industry.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.580
Our guest, Gui Talrico, has worked as an architect who helped automate that world by bringing

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.700
Python to solve problems where others were just using point-and-click tooling.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.060
I think you'll enjoy this look into that world.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.980
We also touch on his project, PyAirtable, near the end as well.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.580

Dee, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.880
Thanks.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.740
Happy to be here.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.340
Yeah, it's fantastic to have you here.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.160
I'm really excited to talk about buildings and architecture and that kind of stuff just

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.360
permeates our lives, right?

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.420
That's, you walk around, you go to cities, you marvel at the large buildings, go to someone's

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.520
house, and it's this beautiful place.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.740
Really nice to see.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.880
All that starts with good architecture and design, right?

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.820
Yeah, that's right.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.860
Where we live, where we work, pretty much most of our lives we spend inside some sort of structure.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.560
Exactly.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.360
Exactly.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.640
Cool.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.840
Well, we're going to talk about that.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.480
Before we get into that, though, let's just start with your story.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.820
How'd you get into programming in Python?

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.860
Yeah, it was a bit of a long journey to Python.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.140
I think my first experience with programming was actually with Lego Mindstorm.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.500
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.920
Yeah.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.480
A little robot thing, right?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.820
Yeah.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.240
You can program those with Python, can't you?

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.600
Yeah.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.200
I don't know what it looks like these days.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.340
I guess when I got it, I was maybe, yeah, in my early teenage years or something.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.220
And at the time, they had something that was similar to MIT's Scratch kind of block, plug and play.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.540
So I did a little bit of that.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.300
And then later, I tried to learn Visual Basic 6, I think also in my early teenage years.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.040
And that was fun.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.560
I built a couple little personal projects.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.320
I feel like we still don't have something to take the place of Visual Basic 6.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.620
Yeah.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.200
Yeah.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.020
Do you think so?

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.800
I mean, I look around at all the different UI platforms, whether that's the stuff we have

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.860
in Python or whether that's Swift or whether that's .NET with WPF or whatever else you want

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.280
to talk about.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.700
Nothing is as easy as, I want these buttons here in a text box and a list and I double click

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.360
it and I write three lines of code and that happens, right?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.620
Yeah.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.160
The environment has changed, right?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.440
Because before they were just desktop apps, right?

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.080
You would build it and that's it.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.100
And now you have to think about, even if.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.420
React has made it as easy to build front end app, you still have to deal with something

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.660
else for styling and then you have to figure out how you're going to serve the data or are

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.580
going to deploy it to you.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.440
Yeah.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.200
I think you're right.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.500
I mean, I'm not saying VV6 is the pinnacle of what we could design, right?

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.740
It's not going to win massive design awards, but wow.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.640
Could people get stuff done quickly with that framework?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.980
Yeah.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.560
So you did a little bit there, huh?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.740
Yeah.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.980
I never got too deep, but it was an extension of a robotics course that I was taking.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.700
So we were building these little UIs and then clicking around and having the robot move or

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.000
something.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.580
So it was very basic UI.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.040
But what was interesting is at the time I grew up in Brazil and at the time it was still there

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.760
and I wanted to get really deep, but there was this, there was a bit of a language barrier,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.320
I think.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.960
This was also, you know, pre-Google.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.700
So trying to learn how to program while also not knowing how to speak English, I actually

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.960
feel like it slowed me down a bit.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.280
Yeah.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.040
I can imagine.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.700
I've always had a lot of both respect and I guess a little bit of sympathy for people

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.500
who are non-native English speakers, especially people who didn't particularly speak English

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.480
super well, but then had to program with for loops and while loops and true and false and

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.900
ints.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.400
And it's just like, if, you know, maybe if you're with a language that's not that different,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.960
it's not that hard, but you know, if you're like Chinese or even Portuguese, it's, you know,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.760
why do you have to program all these foreign words?

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.180
It just seems crazy to me that that's how it has been, right?

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.460
Yeah.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:56.320
And also the resources even today with post-Google era or during the Google era, you can, if you

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.200
search for some sort of engineer problem in English or in Portuguese, I can guarantee you're

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.400
going to get a much bigger pool of answers and resources in English.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.120
So yeah.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.700
Yeah.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.000
Yeah.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.580
That was a little bit of a barrier.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.380
In fact, what actually happened is I never really progressed and I just went on to other

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.780
things.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.240
All right.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.820
Maybe this program and things not for me.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.260
Yeah.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.080
I don't know.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.800
I guess, yeah, I just kind of didn't really get it.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.660
Never really clicked.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.500
And then I moved on to other things and ended up pursuing a degree in architecture to talk

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.280
a little bit about it, but it was a little bit of kind of a gap.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.500
And then I think it was just during my college years, I tried getting into a little bit of

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.620
web development, played around with action script, flash, or I think that's what it's called.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.800
Right.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.060
It was like JavaScript, like inside flash.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.020
And then within architecture, I got a little bit into like visual programming, which

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.340
it's, I guess, a more sophisticated version of, you know, scratch, but similar to what

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.960
3ds Max uses to compose material.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.100
You know, this idea that you can kind of connect flows into each other visually.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.520
And that's used pretty extensively in architecture still.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.500
And that was kind of like my gateway back into programming in some ways.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.940
And then a couple of years later, I actually practiced architecture for, I think about five

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.560
or six years.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.700
And at the time I was trying to figure out how I could change careers.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.140
And I was just, I had this kind of itch.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.700
I just really wanted to write code and I couldn't figure out how to kind of break it.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.980
And I ended up doing this process of changing careers.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.380
I actually took a year off and spent every kind of brief minute I had trying to learn how

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.780
to code.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.480
Was that on your own or did you go to university?

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.800
Yeah, it was just on my own.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.140
Yeah.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.780
Literally like Google, what language should I learn first?

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.200
And this was like 2014, I think 15.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.300
And I actually picked Ruby first.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.220
This was Ruby on Rails.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.700
Yeah.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.880
Golden years, I guess.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.500
And I started with Ruby and after a couple of weeks, I just didn't enjoy it that much.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.160
I was getting confused with some of the basic kind of built-in blocks and I decided to try

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.480
Python and it was just kind of smooth sailing.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.120
I mean, I guess as smooth as it can be learning by yourself.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.980
Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.040
But, you know, I felt like even the basic grammar, it was just kind of stick.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.100
I didn't have to keep going back and say, oh, how do you do a for loop again?

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.440
I found it was always a bit stickier with me, not having to think about where semicolons

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.580
would go, you know.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.540
Yeah.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.980
It was just easier and smoother and more enjoyable for me in general.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.460
For sure.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.460
Well, I gave VB a lot of positive praise a little bit ago.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:33.120
I think also that language is a really interesting example of how to try to be like,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.960
Python, but not do it well.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.820
So, with JavaScript or C# or a lot of these languages, you have all these symbols

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.920
on the screen, especially the static languages.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.660
C#, Java, C++, right?

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.200
Semicolons, angle brackets, you know, parentheses, all sorts of stuff all over the place.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.800
And then there's languages like Python that say, you know, you don't need that.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.880
You don't need all these symbols.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.180
Let's just go and write it.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.880
And, you know, VB is like that, right?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.920
There's no semicolons.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.940
There's not that many symbols.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.400
But it's like everything is begin for, end for.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.520
Like, it's just, it's the worst possible.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.760
It's like they still need the closing curly braces and stuff like that, but they don't want to

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.440
put a curly brace.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.920
So, they make you type like a huge long word, which is crazy.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.420
And somehow Python struck that like smooth balance of not having all that stuff, but not giving

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.420
up too much as well.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.680
Yeah, and also the boilerplate that's required.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.560
I think I had tried doing some C# as well.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.500
And when you open up the simplest example you can find, and it's class, void, public.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.000
And you're like, wait, what is public?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.220
You haven't gone to understand classes or access and things like that.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.600
And it's really overwhelming.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.520
And in Python, it's like, even the class takes a little bit when you're learning, but you can

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.340
just, here's a function that's inside of this object.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.280
And it's much easier to understand, I think, as a beginner.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.100
It's kind of ramp up.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:59.020
I think it's a big testament that you can be really effective with Python with a super, like

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.720
a very partial understanding of what Python is or how it works, right?

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.660
You can not even be aware that half of the stuff exists and you can still get along just

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:06.960
fine.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.360
So, that's pretty awesome.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.620
So, let's dive into the main topic, buildings, architecture.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.820
So, I've seen some of the presentations you've given, and it sounds to me like this is an industry

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.120
that's ripe for more programming, automation, empowerment.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.140
You know, I always say that programming is a superpower for people who are not programmers,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:28.540
right?

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.680
If you're an architect versus an architect who programs, the programming architect can do way

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.220
more, right?

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.880
And it sounds to me like this area is kind of open for more of that.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.480
Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.500
Give us the background.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.380
So, it starts with pictures and drawings and blueprints type things, right?

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.380
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.820
So, I mean, I guess I should just preface this with the fact that I've been outside the industry

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.180
for about four years now.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.780
I'm just doing more traditional software development.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:00.460
So, I may be a little bit out of the loop on some changes, but in general, the time I spend

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.620
in the industry, what you would see is that it's still a pretty kind of analog industry.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.220
And there are parts that are improving.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.940
There are parts that are very advanced.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.680
I mean, we do still manage to build incredible buildings.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.980
But there's this weird kind of tension where people are coming up with these design concepts

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.940
and figuring out what the building is going to look like, what spaces you're going to need.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:27.800
And then kind of at the other end, you have people standing on their literally cutting material

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.180
and assembling things.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.360
And then there's this big kind of gap in the middle of how you go from one thing to another.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.120
And that's kind of the meat of architecture.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.820
So, my experience was primarily medium and large buildings.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:47.360
And it's actually just very labor-intensive labor as far as software, not the hands-on labor

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.160
for architects.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.880
But there's just a lot of work that goes into designing a big building.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.500
So, if you have a, I don't know, one of the office buildings I worked on, 150,000 square

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.920
feet, six-story or something.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.180
And someone had come up with a design, okay, it's going to look like this.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.620
And it was very conceptual design, kind of massive.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:13.900
And then you have to turn into a real project with faucets that work and lights and sprinklers.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.620
Exactly.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.540
When you think, well, let me rephrase that.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:21.660
When I think of architecture, I think of the overall feel of it, right?

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.940
Is it flowing?

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.500
Does it have sharp edges?

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.340
Does it feel modern, right?

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.460
And so on.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.060
I have a picture here on the screen for us to look at that's this, you know, sort of

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.980
wood structure.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.220
It's light and airy.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.480
And sure, that's architecture.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.500
But it sounds like, and so are the support beams.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.940
So is the plumbing.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.000
So is the light switch and where they go.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.180
And just way more detail than just the general skeleton or structure.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.460
Yeah, and like which part of the plywood is going to go in which direction, like on your

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.520
kitchen counter or something, like that level of detail.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.420
But what you're showing here, it's kind of what you see in school and what you get really

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.460
excited about in school.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.660
And then when you start working, you realize that there's only a few people that get to

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.680
do this type of work.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:13.280
And the majority of the people are just kind of doing coordination and working on lots of

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.940
drawings and coordination between different trades.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.140
But, you know, of course that does happen, but big chunk of the work is just figuring

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.120
out how to coordinate and assemble drawings.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:28.760
So if you imagine a lot of this work is done on kind of traditional desktop applications.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.520
So if you're familiar with Autodesk, the biggest ones in the US are AutoCAD, Revit.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.520
Those are more, Revit is very like architecture kind of building focused.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.320
AutoCAD is more kind of generic, I know, drawing and drafting.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:48.960
And then you have other players like MacNeil, they do kind of 3D modeling and it's used all

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.240
the way from small jewelry design and boats all the way to buildings, but more at the conceptual

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.420
stage and Revit is kind of the big dog as far as like building documentation.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.740
And there's this interesting process because at the same time you are coming up with the

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.300
building at large scale, right?

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.220
Like what do you see there?

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.220
That's kind of mass in.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.180
You have to zoom in all the way to what is it going to look like?

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.560
Like cove in a bathroom, for example, and you might have to.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.300
Cut a section through that in detail.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.100
And there's this weird process we are still in where buildings are designed half in 3D

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:19.940
and half in 2D.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.580
So you do some 3D and then you get sort of these views, but then you might zoom in and

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.080
actually.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.420
Then you do a projection.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.240
You're like, oh, we need to see just this wall.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.660
Yeah.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.180
Yes.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.460
Or just the floor.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.120
How it's going to look.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.420
You can assemble the sketch work needs a drawing of like, what does it look like if I cut

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:35.800
through here?

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.580
And you literally draw in 2D and you have to assemble these big drawing sets that are references

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.840
that show the 3D and say, okay, if you were to cut through this, here's what you would see.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.460
And oftentimes they're not even like the same model.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.600
You're just trying to make this thing look coordinated.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.040
How often does it go wrong?

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.100
Oh, pretty often.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:53.500
Yeah.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.200
Pretty often.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.920
So one of the things that's done, usually there's a tool called Navisworks is one of the ones

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.840
that's used that's for clash detection.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.440
So, cause not only have the architects, but you also have these trades coming together, right?

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:11.780
So you have separate models for the architecture, like walls and floors and things like that.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:17.060
And then you have the structural engineer as a separate model with all the steel or concrete

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:17.540
structure.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:24.500
And maybe the MEP, mechanical, electrical employment folks have a separate model and then they all

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.140
get linked.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:30.980
And in the end you may have like a duck going through a life fixture or things kind of through

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:31.220
all.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.540
And you actually have to do clash detections and trying to figure out places where the model

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.540
may not have a kind of a valid condition.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:37.860
Yeah.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.820
I can imagine.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:45.300
So this Revit app is largely a .NET C# desktop application.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:45.700
Is that right?

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.580
Yeah, correct.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.060
Yeah.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.420
And so if you want a programmer to work with it, what do you do?

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.780
Do you do that in C#?

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.020
Yeah.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.660
So Revit's been around for a while and I'm not sure when it started.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.860
I don't think it was from the very beginning, but at some point they released an API and without

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.980
this API, you can do everything through the UI, right?

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.740
So you can click around and you can basically achieve everything you need to.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.140
And through the API, you can sort of automate everything that's visible and sometimes a

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.020
little bit more.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:20.260
But the idea is that, for example, one of the first tasks I automated in Revit was I was working

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.500
in a really large office buildings and each room would get tagged with like the name of

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.140
the room.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:25.140
Right.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.220
And I would have to literally drag the stag on.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:27.220
Right.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.620
And then sometimes as the building moved, things would get kind of out of place and you

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.540
wanted the tags to be kind of centered nicely and you would literally have to go around and

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.580
move around these tags.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.860
And one of the first.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.140
For hundreds of rooms, right?

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.340
That sounds like not a fun, good use of your time.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.940
Oh, no, definitely not at all.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.340
Yeah.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.660
And yeah, one of the first automations I built was this tool that would just go

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.460
automatically room by room and make sure the tag was in the center.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.300
So I'm just going to figure out the delta between the center of the room and where the tag was and

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.020
like slide it.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:56.420
Yeah.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:01.300
And I actually had at the company that I worked at a time, I had a system that would measure the

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.860
use of tools and that tool would just get used like hundreds of times a day.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:10.740
So imagine every time someone clicked that button, the amount of time you would see these architects

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.140
like going around and moving these packs to get them center and just little things like that.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:21.860
Very kind of monotonous, boring, not very impressive automations, but actually a lot of time in the day

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:22.180
to day.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:22.580
Yeah.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:27.300
But you can easily apply code to those and really make people's lives better.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.020
And it sounds like hundreds of people's lives better by, you know, not making them fiddle with

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.220
stupid labels all the time.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:33.860
Oh yeah.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.580
Push a button.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.060
Right.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:40.100
So while these can be programmed in C#, there's a Python angle, right?

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:40.660
Yeah.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.660
There's a couple of different ways that Python comes in.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:48.660
I think Revit itself does support some sort of Python automation, but it's again, it's a bit

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.820
bulky, difficult to use, difficult to debug.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.380
So one of the main ways that it's used these days, there's this project and I've actually

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.860
become really good friends with the maintainer, but there's this project called PyRevit.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:05.860
And the idea is that when you write Python, you get used to things being sort of Pythonic or more

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.180
elegant and it's easy to do, right?

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:13.620
So what he was trying to do is how can we have this kind of experience building automations within

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.660
Revit?

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:21.220
So instead of having to compile my C# add in, how can I kind of just pop up the script, click

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.340
a button and have it run my Python code.

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.660
And that's essentially, you know, what he built.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:32.420
So initially it was using only Iron Python because that's the way it integrates within the Revit

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:32.900
environment.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.020
Since it's .NET, you would essentially use an Iron Python.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.540
You could interact directly with Revit through the common language runtime.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:39.940
Right.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.380
So tell us a bit about Iron Python.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.620
I suspect many people do know about it.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.580
This came originally out of a project at Microsoft.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.420
I think, was this Dino Veland?

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.140
I can't remember.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.260
Yeah, that's what I've heard.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.860
I've interacted with the maintainers a couple of times over the last few years.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.260
And the impression I've had is that there was one or two people kind of trying to get this

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.900
going, but it's not very active.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.020
And I think the three release wasn't too late.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.580
So it shows there it's still in alpha actually.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.220
At the time when I was using it, it was still in 2.7.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.980
It's been stuck there for a long time.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.260
At least it's making progress.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.500
I mean, here's a release in 2021 on it.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.060
So that's good.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:17.540
Yeah.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.940
One of the things I'm not too familiar with it, but I remember hearing from the PyRevit

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.900
maintainer that they actually ended up using this other project called Python.net.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:27.140
Yes.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:33.060
And Iron Python is essentially a Python interpreter that was written in C#.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.700
And Python.net does something kind of different.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:40.260
It actually allows you to use CPython, but interact with the .NET side.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.860
And I don't quite remember how he worked, but I know he got it to work and he was able

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.660
to get CPython applications running inside of Revit as well.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.060
Right.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:54.020
So Iron Python is a Python interpreter, but instead of having the interpreter implemented

00:18:54.020 --> 00:19:00.820
in C the way that the one that we're all mostly familiar with is, it's implemented on top of .NET.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.140
And yeah, that was Dino Vila in that double check.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.140
So nice job on that, Dino.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:11.780
And it's implemented on top of the .NET CLR runtime and it's kind of its own little thing in this thing called the dynamic language runtime,

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:18.020
which means integration with .NET is super easy because it's already running in .NET.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:23.620
It's equivalent to saying integration with C is easy on CPython because it's already effectively running in C, right?

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:30.980
And I guess that's probably a pretty natural way to go because if you're trying to integrate with a C# .NET library,

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.580
you got to somehow get that thing in and do something with it, right?

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:34.900
Right.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.220
So I could see why they would go with Iron Python first.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:44.580
But yeah, I've sort of heard that Python.NET is, it seems a little bit more CPython friendly, I guess.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:50.500
Yeah, I think one of the issues with the Iron Python project is that it's kind of impossible to maintain.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:58.500
Like how do you keep up with all the changes and releases of CPython and like rebuild them from scratch in C#?

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:04.500
I would imagine it would take a huge amount of time and resources to keep that project like going in the same pace.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:12.260
Yeah. So here looking at Python.NET, we've got, it supports 27, but also 35, 36, 37, and 38, which is not 39 and 310.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:12.660
Yeah.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.860
But it sure is better than alpha support for 3.4.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.860
Yeah. Do you know how it actually, like what it actually does? How does it get to?

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:27.860
I have no, I have not learned enough about Python.NET to know how it works, but it's, yeah, it looks pretty neat though, doesn't it?

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:33.780
Yeah. But I think it's just, it's, you're able to operate in CPython, but kind of import common-legged

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:40.580
during time and talk to your .NET DLLs in the same way you would from Iron Python. So it's pretty interesting.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:46.820
Yeah. You get very foreign looking code. Import CLR from system.winds.forms, import form,

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.900
which is something you would expect to see in a .NET project, not in a Python project.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:55.300
Yeah. But there's actually, that's one interesting thing that I've seen happen quite a bit because

00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:01.860
people within this industry ended up using Iron Python quite a bit. I know there's a few projects

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:08.580
out there for building UIs in Python, but I've actually seen quite a few projects with like desktop UIs

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.020
basically built using, you know, .NET because it has...

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:12.580
Oh, interesting.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.460
What is it? Windforms? I forgot what the other one was.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:21.540
Yeah. Windforms is the one that's like the modern-ish VB. I say modern-ish because I think they kind of

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:28.180
stopped advancing that in something like 2008, I think is when they stopped advancing it. So it's

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:34.100
not like super modern, but it's way more modern than VB6 was. So yeah, there's that and there's WPF.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:34.980
And then some weird variants.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.940
Oh yeah. WPF is the more current one, right?

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.700
Yeah. Also way harder to use, but yeah, more modern one.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:49.300
This portion of Talk Python to me is brought to you by Shortcut, formerly known as clubhouse.io.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.540
Happy with your project management tool? Most tools are either too simple for a growing

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:58.420
engineering team to manage everything or way too complex for anyone to want to use them without

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:03.940
constant prodding. Shortcut is different though, because it's worse. Wait, no, I mean, it's better.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.460
Shortcut is project management built specifically for software teams.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:12.420
It's fast, intuitive, flexible, powerful, and many other nice positive adjectives.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.860
Key features include team-based workflows. Individual teams can use default workflows or

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:23.460
customize them to match the way they work. Org-wide goals and roadmaps. The work in these workflows

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:29.380
is automatically tied into larger company goals. It takes one click to move from a roadmap to a team's

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:34.580
work to individual updates and back. Type version control integration. Whether you use GitHub,

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:40.260
GitLab, or Bitbucket, clubhouse ties directly into them so you can update progress from the command line.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:46.340
Keyboard-friendly interface. The rest of Shortcut is just as friendly as their power bar, allowing you to

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.260
do virtually anything without touching your mouse. Throw that thing in the trash.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:56.420
Iteration planning. Set weekly priorities and let Shortcut run the schedule for you with accompanying

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:02.260
burndown charts and other reporting. Give it a try over at talkpython.fm/shortcut. Again, that's talkpython.fm/shortcut.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:10.980
Choose Shortcut because you shouldn't have to project manage your project management.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:17.940
So what you're saying is you've seen some people write Python code that then will do stuff like this

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.060
to put that kind of UI on the screen, right? Right.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:26.740
Yeah. And even PyRevit itself had quite a few kind of UI components and they were all just using standard

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:33.220
.NET stuff, but writing in Python. And what's interesting too is in addition to PyRevit, there's

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:38.660
a few other projects. And one of them I had worked on that's called, it was called Revit Python Wrapper.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:44.100
And there's another one called Revitron, which all have kind of similar idea, which is like,

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:50.660
I want to have the Python experience, but, you know, using this other kind of stack. So the idea

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:57.700
for Revit Python Wrapper is that the Revit API, it's this very bulky C# API. Yeah.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.900
It's enormous. There's...

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:04.180
You can make it do its thing in Python, but you work with the type names and the function

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:09.140
names and stuff straight out of the .NET world, right? Which is clearly not Pythonic. They're

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.060
very different in the way of doing things. Yeah. So your code doesn't look or feel like Python. And

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:18.100
then the interfaces and kind of the APIs for the libraries are weird. So like, if I want to just

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:23.460
query, you know, this model for a wall, I would have to like build this object and this kind of like

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:29.140
builder pattern. And, you know, it's, it's very strange. Like it doesn't feel like Python. So when I

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:34.100
started writing that, I would build these little functions that would take the C# code and

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.620
give me like a Python-like column that I could make. And that's what this project came out from,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:44.660
was this idea that I wanted to wrap everything that didn't feel Pythonic to make it like feel like I

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:50.740
was using it. So you wrote your own, like your PyRevit wrapper a little bit that would then make it

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:55.300
easier, right? And make it feel more natural. And then eventually you just decided... Yeah. So at the

00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:00.100
time I was writing, I was writing Python code and the PyRevit, it was sort of, it was kind of the

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.020
environment. So the idea for PyRevit is you would, you could literally just save this .NET

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:10.580
file in a folder and put a PNG icon and it would sort of load it up that file and add it to the

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:15.540
Revit ribbon. So someone could click on it. And when he clicked, it would load your source code and feed

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:21.620
it into the Python engine. So it would just help you kind of establish this environment and you didn't

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:28.500
have to compile and add in, restart Revit. And then Revit Python wrapper was that every script that I had,

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:34.900
I would just import Revit Python wrapper and then just say collector type equals wall and it would

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.380
query for every wall of the model. And I stopped working on this project for a while. Then I recently

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:44.260
ran into this Revitron, which is a much more kind of sophisticated version, but essentially the same

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:51.060
idea. People wanted to write a very clean Python, but operate kind of on top of the Revit API without

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:57.620
having to deal with the non kind of Python look and feel. Interesting. Okay. Yeah. And even has its own

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:04.820
CLI. Oh yeah. Yeah. I guess it integrates with the PyRevit CLI, right? Yeah. So one of the things that's

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:11.380
interesting about this high Revit, which if I go further enough back, I'll find it, is that you can use

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:17.300
Python to build these little toolbar buttons or widgets, right? Yeah. And the way you do it is,

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:23.940
as you sort of described, there's this super convention of all of these directory, this directory

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:29.860
structure, right? Like if you put this file there and then the Python file in like some location that can,

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:36.500
it'll trigger the discovery that'll then create like a, some kind of icon and action in there, right? Maybe

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.660
tell us about that a bit. Yeah. And under the hood, if you were to write this in C#, there would be a

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.940
whole bunch of boilerplate that you would have to add for how those buttons get instantiated and loaded

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:52.100
into the UI. And one thing that I've sort of witnessed, like seeing PyRevit project grow, I was one of the

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:59.780
kind of early users, adopters. And it was this huge barrier for people who wanted to automate Revit because

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:07.220
you had to learn C# and the add-ins were difficult to build. And it was just this big time.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.460
You probably had to learn interfaces and how to implement them and all that kind of stuff.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.260
Yeah. And like you had to, you had to go around like the little, you know, the compile settings and

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.660
think around with it to get it to work. And you had to compile for different versions of Revit. And it was

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:26.260
really difficult, at least for me, maybe it's easier for some people, but with PyRevit, you could literally just

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:31.460
duplicate this folder and open a new Python file, start messing with it. And every time you click,

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.460
it would rerun. You wouldn't even have to reload anything because you would just read the source

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:40.100
code and feed it to the RnPython interpreter. So for the first time, I felt like I had this ability to

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:46.340
iterate quickly and explore and test things out. So it was a totally different experience.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:52.020
Yeah, that's great. I'm looking at the code sample here for PyRevit, the create your first command

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:58.820
example. And I see exactly what you're talking about with this sort of C# abstractions leaking into the

00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.220
Python world.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.220
Yeah, there's definitely a little vision there.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.220
Yeah, because it says, oh, look how easy it is to build this. You just drop this in this here and you put your

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:12.580
Python file in the folder that is like your button where it contains your icons. And then you write capital

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:19.780
db, capital F filtered, capital E element, capital collector. So filtered element collector of

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:26.660
da da da da, right? It's real similar to what you would expect from that language. That language's idioms

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:27.780
and not Python's idioms.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.660
Yeah.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.740
In the Revit Python wrapper, I started wrapping these classes. So for example, the filtered

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:38.180
element collector, I mean, that's a pretty long that I wouldn't give it to a Python class usually. So

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:43.540
I just called it the collector and I created a class that wrapped the filtered element collector. So

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:49.300
instead of writing something like this, you would say collector type equals wall. And you could write,

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:54.740
you know, wall as an enum and you would sort of basically output this code that you're seeing there.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.740
But the problem is you can't really avoid it because even though you wrapped collector,

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:04.500
there are like 8,000 other like C# classes that I'm not going to wrap them individually.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.260
So like eventually just kind of leaks. You just can't, you can't do the whole thing.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:13.140
Yeah. Somewhere there's some function you can't get in front of and it returns one of these things.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.300
And then, then there it is. Right. Exactly.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:20.260
I tried at some point, I had these wrappers that would take the return and wrap those into some sort

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:24.500
of generic wrapper. And you would get so complicated and people that they couldn't

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:28.660
figure out what it was doing. So that's why that Revit Python project ended up

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.500
just kind of being abandoned at some point. And I wasn't as involved with it anymore.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.740
So I just kind of sat there, but that was the idea. If you look at an example for that one,

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.780
you see that it looks a lot more, more Python-like.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.140
Yeah, absolutely. I'm clearly seeing stuff that looks more like Python.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:47.860
And that's fantastic. Right. Like, you know, variable names. Another thing that you spoke about that,

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:53.780
I don't even know what you were doing to solve this, but you said that you had to somehow adapt to things like

00:29:53.780 --> 00:30:00.180
out parameters and ref parameters, which is a certain way to have a, instead of doing pass by value,

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:05.540
so you can actually modify the reference itself and the parameter. It's a little bit like

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:11.380
passing a pointer to a pointer in C or something like that, where you can change the pointer itself

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:16.500
inside the function. What did they do in Python to deal with that? That seems, I don't know how to

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.060
do that in Python.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:22.180
Iron Python has a special, I don't remember because it's been a while, but Iron Python has a special construct.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.620
Oh, okay. So in Iron Python, there's like an out or something. Okay.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:32.180
Yeah. So you import some special Iron Python object, and that becomes your reference and pass that.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:38.420
So, you know, Iron Python is this, is this weird kind of ways of handling those differences. What's

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.820
difficult is that it's a very niche thing. So when you run into a problem with, with those,

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.860
there's not a whole lot of people like trying to solve this. So it was always a little bit difficult

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:48.260
too.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:54.740
I've had that sort of scenario before. And it's, it's not very often fun. And I remember

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:59.060
specifically one time there was something I was trying to do with this code and it just

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:06.180
was not responding in any way that I expected. And I was, I was at my wits and I'm like, I'm just going

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.980
to Google this. I'm just going to just find whatever I can. And the only answer I could find was a blog

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:15.060
post I wrote about it six months ago. I'm like, well, that's it. We're done. There's,

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:19.860
there's no hope for me now. Cause I'm sure I've tried. I can't do it. And I, the only thing I can

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.540
find is some dumb blog posts that didn't really answer the question I wrote about it. So here we go.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:29.220
On Iron Python, a couple of times I had issues. My only resource was to go into the GitHub project

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:34.660
and actually post an issue. And I said, there's a stack over full question, no responses. I'm

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.100
completely at lost here.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.900
Yeah. Well, that's such one of those, such a big challenge of using one of the

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:46.820
these sort of niche interpreters or runtimes, because when you need help, there's no one to

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:51.620
help you. And if it comes down to some little weird internal behavior, right, that behavior might be

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.980
different. And just because people, they'll tell you, well, that's how it works in CPython. You're

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.820
like, well, I know, but that's not how it works for me right now. Right. Can you help me? Like,

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.220
no, I don't know anything about that. Right. It's, it's a challenge.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:06.420
Yeah. And if you're trying to post a reproducible example in Stack Overflow, and you have to have

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:10.660
Revit open, for example, to execute this, if you're trying to deal with some like,

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.260
lots of iron Python within this environment, it's really difficult.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.700
Yeah. Oh my gosh. I can see why you would want to get away from it. I'm guessing that

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:22.500
Python.net makes this easier. Maybe it's still the same. I'm not entirely sure. I would like to learn

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.780
more about that one, but yeah.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:24.420
Same here.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.700
Yeah. Let's see. On the live stream, I just want to say, hey,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:33.060
Bhavani, that finally could catch up on the live stream here. Big fan of Python. And just,

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:37.700
you know, people listening, if you get the chance to be grateful to drop by the live stream we do on

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:42.420
YouTube, just go to talk python.fm/youtube. YouTube can be part of it. It's always fun to get

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:47.860
input from everyone out there. All right. Give us some examples of the types of things that you were

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:52.980
able to do with Python and automating Revit. There's a talk, I'll go ahead and link to the talk that you

00:32:52.980 --> 00:33:00.820
gave at a meetup in San Francisco at Pine Silla. I'm saying that correctly. Yeah. And you talked about,

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:05.460
there's a lot of nice graphics and you talked a lot about what you've done at various projects and stuff.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:09.540
Give us some concrete examples. Like it's all great in practice to say you could automate stuff,

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.660
but like, what did you actually do?

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:16.020
Yeah. So there was a lot of those kind of very boring, automating, moving tags type of thing.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:21.220
Some of the other bigger projects I worked on at the time I was working at WeWork.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.780
This is the fast growth time at WeWork as well, right?

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:29.300
Yeah, that's right. So when I joined WeWork, it was a relatively small team. I think the

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:34.660
built-in information, you know, modeling team, which is the team that I had joined, had just a handful,

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:41.220
like four, five people. And I think the company as a whole was maybe 800. And when I left four years

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:46.340
later, they were at around 10,000 employees. Oh my gosh. And then the building department,

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:51.540
or the design building and design department initially was open in one or two buildings a

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:58.900
month. And by the time I left, they were open in like 25 or 30. So all other kind of WeWork drama

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.700
side of what happened within the company, within the kind of design and architecture department,

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:07.540
it was just, it was really interesting to see. Yeah. Because traditionally,

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.940
companies build in buildings, they're doing that as a service. So they're an architecture office

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:16.580
that you hire. And WeWork was one of those examples where you had this kind of vertical integration.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:21.460
They were the owners, they were the operators, they were the designers, they were the builders,

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:28.180
they even bought, they acquired a general contractor. So you had this huge opportunity to optimize and to

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:33.300
integrate. So some of the things that we did, like one of the projects I worked there was related to

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:39.940
integrating data from the earlier design process into everything that would happen kind of downstream.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:44.420
So for example, as designers were working on buildings and trying to get them through the

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:50.660
approval process, as soon as this project was sort of starting to materialize, we wanted to get those

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:57.780
spaces fed into the kind of sales pipeline. So we would actually build Revit integrations that would extract

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:03.300
data from these models and feed them to other parts of the company. So one of them was related to

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.020
Oh, interesting.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.500
Yeah. To figuring out how many offices are going to be in this building, how big are they,

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.980
how many desks are in each one, and essentially integrate that, for example, with Salesforce,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:20.420
so that the sales team could start selling them. We did things with supply chain as well. So we have

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:26.980
logistics company that would be trying to orchestrate shipment of, for example, these chairs and couches

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.540
that you see in the photo, they would need to be placed at warehouses and then delivered to buildings

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:36.900
before opening. And they turned these buildings around really quickly. So it was really important

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:42.580
that they had kind of insight. So as people were designing these buildings, we could actually start

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:48.260
quantifying what was being used, what was going to be assigned, and then get the data sort of out of the

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:54.100
model, which is not very, it's essentially a file that sits there. And we would use Python, for example,

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:59.060
to quantify these things, pull the data out, and then send them on to other platforms. So it's a

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.420
little bit of kind of data wrangling.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:06.340
Yeah. It's like JIT interior design, just in time, right? Like, we're going to need this here by

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:11.140
Tuesday. So we're going to automate it. So one of the things you have to do is you have to figure out

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.540
how, you know, maybe describe for, I'm sure not everyone's been inside of what we work before. Give

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.620
us a quick sense of like, what is the inside of what we work look like? Or any, a lot of these co-working

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.020
spaces, but we work is probably one of the bigger ones.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:29.220
Yeah. So we work, it would take empty floor spaces and they would use sort of storefronts,

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:35.220
kind of glass their storefronts and subdivide them into small offices, as small as a single desk or

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:41.940
kind of cuticle. And they could be as big as a 15 or 20 person office. And they were really efficient

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.740
in how they kind of packed these desks. And they would do it in a way that it was very efficient for them.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.740
They would pack these offices really close, but then they would create these really nice,

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:57.140
beautiful shared common spaces. So when you would walk into WeWork, you would often see these very

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:03.220
kind of slick hip spaces, well-designed music playing. So it was this kind of nice experience,

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:09.940
this cool kitchen and coffee area. And I think they were really good at it. I got to work out of WeWork

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:15.620
for many years and it was a really nice change for my previous kind of office environments. And even as a

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.100
a product, I actually really enjoyed what they were building.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:22.660
Nice. Yeah. So one of the things you spoke about is setting up some automation to figure out, well,

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:28.100
how should we lay out these tables, either this open space, like just hangout area tables or

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:34.340
like the co-working desks, or there's some parts that have like glass, clear glass separators. So you

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:38.340
have some sort of quiet, but it's still, they've all got to be laid out, right? And you can say,

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:42.740
okay, if we adjust the walls like this or do that, then here's the arrangement, right?

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:47.380
Yeah. A couple of my coworkers were trying to figure out how to automate this so that

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:52.580
as architects are taking this kind of big floor plate and they're slicing it, they're generally

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:56.660
trying to figure out how the circulation is going to work. And then we build these kind of long blocks,

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.660
and then you're going to start subdividing them to offices. And then as you start subdividing them,

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.500
then you've got to figure out how the desks are going to work. And then you have columns. So actually

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:11.220
like laying them out and getting kind of an efficient algorithm can be kind of time consuming. So some folks from

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:17.460
the data and research team, they were writing algorithms. And the first one that I saw was actually written in Python.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:23.460
And I think it was served like using a Flask API, but the idea is that you could pass it a polygon

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:28.900
and you would apply these rules about how you can lay out desks within this kind of polygon.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:35.220
And you would say, the door is here, do your best to lay out desks. And you would, you would try to do that. It was

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:40.100
fairly straightforward math. It wasn't artificial intelligence or some sort of machine learning. It

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:44.020
was actually pretty straightforward kind of brute force, which I found laying these out along the

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.340
edges. But they were really interesting. They did some really interesting research on that.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:53.060
Yeah. Cool. A lot of nice examples of what you can do with a little bit of Python, a little bit of

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:58.820
automation, even if you've got to somehow mash that together with a .NET or, you know, I guess if it

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:02.340
was a Java API, you could use Jython or some other thing like that, right?

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:07.540
Yeah. And this one specifically, the way we got around it is by actually building it as an API and

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:13.780
have a C# add in called API to do the calculation. So that way we're going to have to deal with it.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.620
Nice. Yeah, that's perfect.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:41.780
AEC.works, which is architectural engineering and construction works. And tell us a bit about this

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:47.220
project. This is a website you built for raising the visibility of cool companies in the space.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:55.620
Yeah. This actually started when I was an engineer at WeWork and I was seeing a lot of really interesting

00:40:55.620 --> 00:41:04.180
companies start to show up and try to build either software products or try to take a technology and

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:10.500
build new companies within AEC that were trying to use technology in some interesting way. And I started

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:16.100
keeping a list of it, Google sheet or your table form or something. And this list started growing.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:21.140
And so it started with four and five and eventually I had 20 or 30 of them. And I would often share them

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:26.900
in different kind of community forums. And then I thought it would be interesting if I could somehow make

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:33.380
that available and maybe even so that people could contribute and edit them. So basically build this out.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:40.580
It's a Django, a traditional, somewhat traditional Django app, except that on the front end, instead of

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:47.860
using templates, I just use Vue.js. So it's a front end, back end separation type project. And yeah,

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:52.340
the idea is that you can create these entries that represent these different companies or products.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:56.500
And then it just, you know, it's kind of displays them. It's pretty simple, nothing really crazy.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:01.140
Nice. Yeah. I will highlight a couple just to give people a sense, but there's a way to come here and say,

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:05.220
suggest a company that's doing like innovative work here, right? So if people are out there like,

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.300
why is my company out here? Well, there's a button, right?

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.020
Yeah, exactly.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:13.940
All right. So I just briefly, let's talk about two of them that are maybe noteworthy.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:20.500
This one right at the top of the moment that says it's called Speckle. And let's see, it says,

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:25.220
engineers, designers, and hackers, and the entire organization rely on us for interoperability

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:30.980
automation. So it's like source control collaboration, versioning notification for

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.380
architectural construction folks.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:40.820
Yeah. It's a little bit like AC architecture, geoconstruction data wrangling on steroids, right?

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:45.140
So when you're in, and if you're working with software, you can pretty much always just like

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:50.420
make a JSON and pass it around. Right. And you can, as long as you can get, you know, at least some basic

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:56.020
data types. Now, if you have to pass around a wall, it's much more difficult than just passing around a

00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:02.500
string. And what type of wall is it? Where is it located? How big it is? It's complicated. So you have

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:06.260
all these different desktop applications. And I've highlighted some that are used primarily within

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:11.060
architecture, like Revit, for example. But there's all these other applications for other disciplines

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.860
within the construction, you know, engineering industry.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:19.860
Right. Some of the ones they highlight are like Unity, Civil, 3D, E-Tabs, Blender, Unreal,

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.220
that kind of stuff. Yeah.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:21.220
Yeah.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.180
There's Revit, yeah.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:28.020
So yeah, the first time Speckle came around, I believe it was like an academic project came out of

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.980
Europe. And what they would do is they would build, like, for example, you know, an add-in for one of

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:39.140
these platforms. And they would output some sort of serialization of these objects. And then they would

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:44.980
build an add-in for another of these, you know, desktop apps that could read that JSON object.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:50.020
And DC realized it back into this architectural or, you know, engineer whatever structural beam or

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:54.500
something. So it was about building all these connectors and would plug into these environments

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:58.260
that weren't very easy to interrupt data in and out. Right.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:03.140
And on top of it, you would have a web platform. I think they call it like streams or something.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:08.020
And that way you could take data from one thing and plug it into another, see them all online

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.340
together and share them, for example. So there's some, you know, really interesting ideas about

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:17.380
collaborating, tracking them. And that's only possible because you take them out of these desktop

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:23.220
apps, because a lot of them are not really built for this type of collaboration or this type of data

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.820
sharing. Yeah. That's a really interesting idea. Like these things do not support

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:31.780
any sort of interoperability, but if we can just get stuff in and out of any one of them,

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:36.340
we could be that middle ground. Right. Yeah. So I don't know a ton about this. I really basically

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:41.300
just skim the website and watch their explainer video, but it seems like some pretty cool open

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.740
source stuff for people in this space. So they could check that out. Right.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.980
Yeah. And what I think what it's exciting about them is that they're actually open source too. So

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:55.780
a lot of software in AC is they're big companies and they're paid and there's not a lot of example of

00:44:55.780 --> 00:45:02.340
successful open source companies essentially. They've actually been able to become a real company with

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.900
employees and raise money and they're open source. So it's really interesting to see them trying to

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.980
build a successful open source model within the industry. Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:18.340
Prad Vaughan out in the live stream says two double high fives for Django for your app at

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:23.860
AEC.works. All right. So that's Speckle, which is cool. And then also Ladybug, Ladybug tools.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:28.340
Yeah. Ladybug is incredible too. Ladybug's been around for a while. I don't know how long,

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:33.620
but it was actually one of my first experiences, one of the first times I got exposed to open source

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:39.780
within AC industry as well. But it's essentially, it started, it was a bunch of Python tools that would help you

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:46.260
do kind of environmental analysis and they would basically use like weather data and some

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:51.620
existing products. I forgot that it's been a while since I used this, but they would essentially wrap

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:58.820
around these heavier duty programs that could actually do like daylight simulation or like solar analysis.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:04.740
But they would, they would build an interface in Python that you could use within, or Revit wasn't too much

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:09.940
later, but right now when some of these other AC applications and the outcome within was that you

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:15.300
would basically would allow any kind of architect, you know, students to essentially take any type of

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:20.020
building that they were designing and actually run and see what does this building look like throughout

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:25.940
the year? What does sun hit or what does light look like inside and actually render these analytical

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:31.140
kind of drawings from it? So it was really interesting. It made all of that kind of accessible to a lot of

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:35.700
people that wouldn't have been able to otherwise. And I think it was entirely written in Python for a long time.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:41.060
Yeah. It has a cross platform, Ladybug tools. It's written in Python, which can be run almost anywhere

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:47.220
and plugged into any geometry engine, which is great. And then it talks about having some visual aspects of

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:54.100
harnessing the capabilities of CAD to produce a variety of interactive 3D graphics, which producing cool interactive graphics in

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:56.820
Python is always fun. But yeah, this one's also free and open source.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:01.860
Yep. That's right. I think they've received some grants from the public of energy or something like

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.780
that. They're pretty well supported.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:09.540
Yeah. And it's 99.8% Python. That's still a lot of Python and 0.2% other.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.580
It's probably marked down.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:15.620
It's probably. I'm guessing it's the one shell script and the requirements.txt here.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.580
Yeah, that's right.

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:22.100
Awesome. All right. So all that stuff is super neat. The work that you're doing here to shine a light on,

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:26.820
the different ways we can automate stuff. In architecture, we've got Revit and then the

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:35.220
PyRevit and the Python Revit wrapper and then Revtron, you said. And then also these open source

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:40.020
like connectors and interoperability platforms are all super neat. I do want to talk to you about

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:44.740
one other thing that doesn't have a super clear connection, but it's also, it sounds like it came

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:48.340
out of your time at WeWork, this stuff you did with Airtable. Is that right?

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.460
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:54.500
Yeah. So Airtable is something that I've seen and I've had people tell me that, oh, you definitely have

00:47:54.500 --> 00:48:00.420
to work with Airtable. It's amazing. It's like Sheets or Excel, but way nicer or things like that.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:04.820
Tell us, you know, a couple people out there, Airtable is this commercial product, right? Tell us about

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:08.020
this and then we'll get to some Python side of things in a moment.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:13.620
Yeah. I'm a huge fan of Airtable. Pretty much since the first time I sort of run into it,

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:19.540
I've been an user and I use it for everything personal projects work, but I define it as this

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:25.940
kind of Google Sheets meet relational database. And I think there are other products like it,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.980
but I find Airtable just really kind of a joy to use.

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:34.260
Yeah. I also feel like there's a Trello Kanban board aspect of it as well, right?

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:37.860
Yeah. They've been adding, you know, quite a few kind of like views

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:42.340
and tooling on top of the underlying data. So there's some interesting things you can do.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:49.780
It's not as sort of pure of a kind of tracker as Trello is, but you can basically build a Trello-like

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:56.020
interface and there's a Kanban mode. So you can, whatever your roles are, if you have certain fields.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:49:01.140
So for example, you could maybe have a table with like apartments you're enlisted, for example, and maybe

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:07.540
you have a column that is the status, whether you've visited them or not. And in Google Sheet, you would maybe

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:12.740
type it or do like a data validation. In Airtable, you can actually see this is a field that links to

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:19.140
this other table and you have the options that I want. And you can kind of create truly kind of relational

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:24.100
data and have these views be linked to each other and in some really interesting ways.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:30.340
Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So it's, it's a little bit like spreadsheet meets relational database

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:34.340
that has relationships rather than just random stuff you type in Excel, right?

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:39.540
Yeah, that's right. Cool. All right. So that's Airtable. The Python side of things is you created

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:45.700
this thing called a PI Airtable, which is a Python client for the Airtable API, right? Tell people about

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:51.460
this. The initial version of this was through my time at WeWork as well, but we had all these Airtables

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:56.820
that would store, I think one of them was like a furniture database. So everywhere was a piece of

00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:02.820
furniture and you had all this detail about these objects, maybe some data. And now you were to use

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:08.180
that in other places or you wanted to feed additional data in that, in that table. So Airtable

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:14.020
expose an API, but API, it's somewhat simple and minimal, but you know, it works as effective.

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:21.380
So this was originally called Airtable Python Wrapper and was recently renamed to PI Airtable, but it's just

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:29.300
a kind of a lightweight Python client around. It just, it adds a lot of the kind of nuances about the, the API

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:34.820
itself, some of the data types and just kind of a high level interface. So then you can just kind of

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:39.540
import it and you don't have to go spend too much time in the documentation, figuring out what all

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:44.500
the HTTP requests are. And it just wraps them up and handles a lot of the, a lot of the things and add

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:49.860
some, you know, nice high level abstractions to make it really easy to use. I've been working on this

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:54.900
project for probably maybe three years now. And it was really interesting because in the beginning it was

00:50:54.900 --> 00:51:00.260
just me and I thought it was useful to have this and I just kind of put it out there. And it was really

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:06.980
fun to see like people coming into the repo and actually asking questions or opening bug tickets.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:13.300
And in some cases, like I've had people just do lots of contributions. Like this one, this one person

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:18.740
came out of nowhere, would they, and just like rewrote a test suite for it. I had these, the initial

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:24.420
test suite, I guess I didn't know any better, would actually make calls to the API. And it was hard because

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:30.100
the state wasn't predictable. Tests were a bit slow. So I guess when I did that, I didn't know you should

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:35.300
sort of mock your requests and run your tests that way. And they literally came and like rewrote all

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:41.300
my test suites. And so it was really fun. And it's been kind of one of the longer running open source

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:46.180
projects that I've had. And over time I've just gotten better at kind of maintaining and added features.

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:52.980
And then more recently, I just kind of rebranded Aspire table, build new documentation. And it's been

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:58.820
really fun to see the project grow and it's got a decent user base. So I often see people coming up in

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.980
there and I searched GitHub every once in a while and I see it used in a lot of different places.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.020
So it's really cool to see.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:10.100
Yeah, that's fantastic. So you said it has 200,000 downloads a month and it's listed as the

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:14.580
official Python air table library, right? And the air table docs.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:22.340
Yeah. I assume those 200,000, a lot of them are CI. I don't know how many are actual direct installs,

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:26.340
but you know, it does get used. Yeah. And then the air table documentation.

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:29.460
That's not nothing, right? So that's a lot, right? Even if it's a quarter,

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:29.940
Yeah. Yeah.

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:31.860
That's still a ton of people using the library.

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.700
Yeah. It's pretty exciting. And then recently, I think it was about a month ago or so,

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:41.140
they added to the official documentation as the community driven kind of Python client. And

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:46.020
they didn't have any others listed before that. So I think that's bringing more people.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.620
Nice. And so you said it also has some ORM capabilities.

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:54.420
Yeah. So this was really fun. I would always use this library or whatever I needed to work with

00:52:54.420 --> 00:53:00.580
their table, but I would oftentimes want to build classes for the models that I had. I was always,

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:05.780
I love using Django and these different types of ORMs. I think it's a really fun way of kind of working

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:12.260
with persistence. And I wanted to do something like that with air table. So I, in this recent release,

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:18.580
I basically kind of tried to build my little ORM and the idea is that I would define, for example,

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:24.180
if I had an air table that it was contact, name, first name, email or something, I could essentially,

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:30.740
you know, define a class called contact and then inherit from this air table base model and then

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:37.300
define the fields. And then I could just instantiate that class and say, not save. And you would fire the

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:42.340
request to basically save it. I could update an attribute and then just hit save and you would

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:47.860
update it or call it delete method. So it was really fun. I don't know how much that's used. It's kind of

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:53.860
a new feature, but I had tons of fun building it. And I got into descriptors, which I had never used

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:59.620
before. Yeah. Descriptors are wild. Yeah. They were really crazy. So you had to define, these are the

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:04.340
attributes this model should have, but when you actually instantiate, they behave very differently.

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:10.340
You want to get the actual value, but not the kind of the field type. So descriptors were

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.460
the natural answer, everything to it, but it was really fun building it.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:18.500
Right. And you've got like text fields and email fields and even checkbox fields, which I don't

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:24.820
typically recall from the Django ORM or SQL. Yeah. That's an air table, a kind of native type.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:30.980
Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. You even have links from one air table to another. Cool. Yeah. I didn't

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:36.100
realize it had this ORM aspect to it. This is very neat. Yeah. So when you fetch a record from air table,

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:41.140
if it's a link, you actually just get the ID. It doesn't actually like transverse the link. So

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:47.300
if you define it as a, as a link field, it actually takes that ID and fetches the next one. And then

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:53.060
actually gives you the object instead of the ID. Yeah. Perfect. Like a foreign key type of relationship

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:57.860
thing. Awesome. All right. Anything else you want to throw out there about higher table before we

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.620
wrap this thing up? No, that's it. Yeah. So if people are out there using air table and they want to

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:06.260
treat it like an ORM, I just want to talk to it. Yeah. Sounds like you should check this out.

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:11.860
Yeah. I actually have a blog post I wrote when I, maybe about a year ago, that was called using air

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:18.180
table as a backend on the medium. And it was an initial version of AC that works instead of having

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:24.580
a Django backend. I actually tried to build it with just an air table serving it. And it was interesting.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:29.300
It's not, you won't have all the guarantees you have from a, from a proper database, but it's a really

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:34.900
easy way if you just want to put data somewhere and be able to fetch it. And you also get a free kind of

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:40.100
UI that you can see the data and change it. So yeah, it's kind of like the admin backend of Django,

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:45.060
but it's like this super rich thing in the form of air table, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Very nice.

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:51.300
I mean, maybe it's not a full ACID transactional database, but at the same time, if that's where

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:55.700
people are putting the data, you don't want to put it into Postgres and then try to keep the thing in

00:55:55.700 --> 00:56:00.500
sync or something like that. Doesn't sound fun either. Right. So use the one place that holds the data.

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:03.780
That's what you're doing. Yeah, exactly. You won't get, I mean, I think if you're doing this,

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:08.180
you're probably not, you won't be replacing Postgres, but it would maybe be replacing just

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:13.860
like a local file or something. Yeah. But yeah, you do get, you get some form of like revision.

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:19.060
It keeps track of every change. And so you get a lot for free. Yeah. Very nice. Yeah. People should

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:23.860
definitely check that out. All right. Well, we're about out of our time. So let me ask you the final

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:29.460
two questions here. If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use? I think these days

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:33.860
it's probably always VS Code, right? Or a big percentage of it.

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:39.540
Yeah. There's definitely a big chunk. Yeah. I had a little, like my first one was notepad

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:45.780
plus. Then I think I used add a sublime for a while and then add them and then end up in VS Code. And

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:51.460
these days I, I just, I love the Python integrations that the team that there has built. So I couldn't

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:55.060
really see myself moving away from it anytime soon. Yeah. That's cool.

00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:55.860
Very invested in it.

00:56:55.860 --> 00:57:02.100
Oh, there's a lot of action going around on with VS Code in general. And then also in the Python

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:09.780
aspect of it. Right. I do feel like this sublime to Adam to almost everyone who is on that path.

00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:11.300
VS Code is the destination.

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:11.700
Yeah.

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:12.260
I agree.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:12.260
Yeah.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.020
It just kept getting easier.

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:18.420
Cool. All right. And notable IPI package. I mean, you've already given us

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:22.340
many different packages and things for people to check out, but something that, you know,

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:25.300
you ran across like, oh, this is cool. I really got to tell people about this one.

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:30.500
Yeah. This is not a secret package. I think it's a pretty well-known, but I, I've just

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:35.300
really come to enjoy using a Pydantic. It's one of those that I think I added on pretty much every

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:41.220
project I have. I think it's such a blast just to be able to define my classes and set the types.

00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:46.180
I really enjoyed the way the project came together and it's sort of one of the standard ones that I

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.140
added everywhere now.

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:52.900
Yeah. If you have to parse data into your model or turn your model into something like JSON,

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:56.580
it really helps a lot, especially if you have a hierarchical model, right? I've got this thing

00:57:56.580 --> 00:58:01.860
that contains a list of other Pydantic models, and then you've got to do type conversions to date

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:04.580
times or to numbers or stuff like that. Yeah. It's fantastic.

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:10.660
Yeah. And even on projects, you're collaborating with other people, you have a sort of my PY first

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:15.380
kind of approach, right? Where from the very beginning, your objects are kind of typed and

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:19.860
that just makes it a lot easier to collaborate with other people that will jump into your project. And

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.900
it's very clear what that object is and all the types. Yeah.

00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:25.540
So that kind of helps make sure that you stick with it.

00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:29.940
Absolutely. Good recommendation. I suspect people probably have heard of it as well, but it's

00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:34.260
definitely a good one. Yeah. I've had Samuel on the show to talk about it. All right. Final call to

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:40.500
action. People, especially those out in architecture, engineering, construction, are excited about Python

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.940
and some of the tools. What do you tell them?

00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:46.660
I think it's a, it's an exciting time for the construction industry. It's kind of really good

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:52.100
place to innovate. There's a lot of exciting technology products and companies being built.

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:57.300
So I think there's a lot of opportunities to do something in kind of a different space. And I think

00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:02.260
they can really benefit from experience people that have been, you know, doing more traditional

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:07.380
software development to help them scale and build things. So yeah, it's interesting to see how

00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:12.580
that those kinds of streams cross and to see architects go to build software and also seeing

00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:18.100
engineers come to help make the architecture and construction industry better. Yeah. Fantastic.

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:24.180
All right. Well, thank you so much for being here. It's been great to have you on the show. And I'd love

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:29.620
to get these views into the different areas and communities where Python is making a difference.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.260
So thanks for sharing it in the architecture space.

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.140
Nice. My pleasure.

00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:34.740
Yeah, you bet. See you later.

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:35.300
Thanks, man.
