00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.220
Hennick has been writing and speaking on some of the most significant topics in the Python space,

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.520
and I've enjoyed his takes. So I invited him on the show to share them with all of us.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.460
This episode really epitomizes one of the reasons I launched Talk Python nine years ago.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.540
It's as if we run into each other at a bar during a conference, and I ask Hennick,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.600
so what are your thoughts on, and we dive down the rabbit hole for an hour.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.120
I hope you enjoy it. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 481, recorded October 8th, 2024.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.760
Are you ready for your host, please?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.420

Eric, welcome back to Talk Python.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.180
Good to see you, man.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.220
Thanks for having me.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.480
Yeah, it's great to have you back on the show.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.540
I've been enjoying a lot of your articles and your videos lately.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.700
And you know what?

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.960
Maybe we should just get together and have an opinion piece by Hennick.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.860
I can do opinions.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.360
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.040
You're great, Adam.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.000
And so we're going to talk about a whole bunch of different things.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.400
A lot of the things that you've been talking about, I'm also super interested in.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.020
Some cool articles you've written on Docker.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.840
UV, last time you were on, we talked about running in production.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.460
And maybe we can review that a little bit and just get some of your takes to see what's changed

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.620
and what's still the same over the last couple of years.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.920
But all those things are awesome.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.640
We're going to talk about some of your open source projects.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.800
It's going to be a journey.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.300
It's going to be fun.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.380
Now, before we jump into all that, you know, it's been a couple of years since people heard

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.060
you on the show.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.940
Just a quick background about who you are.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.520
All right.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.780
My name is Hennick.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.400
I usually just go by my first name because it's already overwhelming to most people to pronounce

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.180
that one correctly.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.840
Hi, Brian.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.980
My last name is Slavak.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.820
There's really not a lot of Hennicks around.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.540
So I'll just stick to the first name.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.080
So as you can hear, I'm a Czech living in Germany.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.800
And I live in Berlin.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.940
And I work for a rather small web hosting company and domain restaurant called Vario Media.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.260
So you probably haven't heard of us unless you speak German because we only serve the German

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.900
speaking market.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.740
Like we do speak English, but our stuff is in German.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.800
And I would say you would call it individual contributor there.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.760
So we don't have managers.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.600
So everybody is.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.120
Since you are rather small, stability is like the key thing when I'm building systems.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.000
And that's like informs a lot of my opinions that you will probably hear today from me.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.600
Also, I like traveling and I don't want to be paged in the middle of my vacation.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.860
I'm having margaritas on a beach.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.660
Nobody wants to have to put down the margarita because someone took down the server.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.320
Also, I'm sure we're going to speak more about that.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.260
But also nowadays, I'm also a YouTuber.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.300
So that's also very exciting.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.140
And thanks for the shout out in the last Python Bytes.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.440
I really appreciate it.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.320
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.200
You're very welcome.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.700
Awesome.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.380
And I think it's interesting to have people who work on small teams, especially smaller companies,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.860
because that's the common theme of what people do.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.020
I don't have it pulled up right now.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.860
But if you go to the PSF survey and you look at some of the demographics stuff,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.200
it'll say, well, what size of a team do you work on?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.180
Is it one person, two to five, 500 to 1,000?

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.140
The vast majority is the two to 10 different people.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.020
It's not Google, Facebook, Microsoft, right?

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.540
So a lot of the advice that comes from these huge places is just, I don't know,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.860
it's not super relevant.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.860
Call it like Google cosplay.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.860
And I feel like my opinions that there are about this whole production thing are informed

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.120
by my distinct dislike for these kind of things.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.240
They're just like some big tech influencers having opinions on stage and everybody wants

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.180
to mimic it.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.540
And it just doesn't make any sense.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.160
Because as you said, the long tail is huge.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.060
Like most people work for small companies.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.120
It's just like that.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.400
The things you should do, they're just different.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.400
And you know, no disrespect to those companies, but, and they have a lot of employees, but in

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.000
the general population, it's very small group of people who have hyperscaling clouds and

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.420
whatnot that they're, they're worried about, right?

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.300
I think I want to start this conversation off here by talking about some of the articles

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.780
you've written.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.860
So I think this one's interesting.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.820
Let's talk about virtual environments.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.460
Love them.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.160
I do too.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.320
And you wrote this article called why I still use Python virtual environments in Docker.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.900
And I do as well.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.200
And I, when I didn't use Docker, I had them on my server as well.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.540
I feel like they're a really interesting, predictable way to package Python.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.300
And you know, you hear about them, obviously, oh, well, you're going to create a virtual environment

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.800
so you can have multiple projects in your computer and so on.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.280
But Docker, there's only one app running.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.060
What's the deal with these virtual environments in Docker?

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.520
Yeah.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.000
I mean, you just said it, right?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.600
It's a lot more predictable in its behavior.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.480
It's a technology that we use everywhere too.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.340
I just understand what this directory is doing.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.100
I find it very important that when I just go on a server or in a Docker container, I

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.520
know what a file is doing or how things interact with each other.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.960
And I don't have to hunt them down somewhere else.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.720
Or another popular thing is that I write in the first paragraph is that people use pip install

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.540
user and then set the Python user base directory.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.600
And sure, you can do all these things.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.660
But why would you, right?

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.880
Like, what are you gaining?

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.860
And it's a lot of vibes.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.640
And I admit it in the article too.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.780
But I just find it easier to reason about.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.800
And not everything.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.140
We don't use only things we need, right?

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.640
Like we use affordances in other places too.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.720
So why not this as an abstraction over an application artifact?

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.360
Because we don't have anything better in Python.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.780
Yeah.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.960
And also one of the things that you point out in your article that I think is really nice,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.560
that's already the way you're working on your computer.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.380
And so when you go to your Docker container, it's the same.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.800
You don't have to think about, well, if it's misbehaving in production, that's because,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.980
well, maybe we've changed the Python path or whatever, right?

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.740
It's exactly the same as everyone else is working with.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.940
Yeah.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.860
We forgot to set an environment variable.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.260
Oh no.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.300
Nothing works now.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.140
Exactly.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.480
That's been interesting.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.200
Let's talk about Docker just a little bit as well.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.040
I think that alone is a pretty interesting choice.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:26.420
You said you work on smaller teams and maybe web hosting companies give this a little bit

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.620
of a plus plus slant on Docker or not.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.960
But Docker, no Docker, right?

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.880
A lot of people, I think, see containers and they think complexity.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.720
They think it's hard to debug.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.000
Like if something goes wrong in the container, it's just, it's opaque to me.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.280
What would you say to people that feel like containers are too complicated?

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.780
Obviously the answer is, as always, it depends, right?

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.900
It's a trade-off like everything else.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.840
We don't give Docker to our customers.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.940
Like our customers, we sell mostly LAMP, like mostly WordPress, which is very interesting these days.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.720
Oh my gosh.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.300
I don't know if we want to go down that one, but it is super, super turmoil right now.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:02.460
Yeah.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.180
No, we don't.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.800
Let's not go down.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.440
Matt doesn't know we exist.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:05.880
It's fine.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.400
Yeah.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.900
So you're trading off the things you just said, like the debuggability and everything

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.620
against development velocity and reproducibility.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.000
So we, for example, we don't run Kubernetes because it's just too complex for us to run.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.660
And we run everything on premise.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.340
So like we do not have anything.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.780
We do not use any external services whatsoever.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.480
Wow.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:28.840
Okay.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.180
So everything runs into our own data centers.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.100
So we are European.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.800
So some of the things we have to do, other things we do because Germans like it that way.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.740
We can say, like, our data center is right there.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.500
You can look at it.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.100
No data leaves it.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.320
Yeah.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.920
If you have to, I can come look at my code through the little rack window.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.860
There it is.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.100
You can try right inside and see how fast you get tasered by the security side.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.000
It's all good.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.940
We use quite a bit of HashiCorp software.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.780
So we had Consul and Vault before for configuration, service discovery, and secrets.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.760
So we use Nomad because it was a logical add-on to run our applications.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.500
So that's where most of our web applications run.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.880
Like, everything that can run in containers usually runs in our Nomad cluster in Docker containers.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.900
And, yeah, sometimes there are a bit of a pain to debug.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.760
But you can SSH into a Docker container, right?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:23.960
Yeah.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.780
First hot tip of the day, there's this thing called BusyBox, which is, like, one command.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.400
And depending on what name you call it, it's something different.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.740
And it's just, yeah, it's just very, very few bytes.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.140
Like, you can look at it.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.340
And it's static.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.680
And it gives me things like ping.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.920
And I think Traceroute is in there, too.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.520
Yeah.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.260
I can do all these basic things in those containers, too.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.380
So it's not like it's a completely black box.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.480
You can SSH into them.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.060
It's no problem.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.740
A couple of thoughts.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.060
One, I agree with you on that.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.460
One more thing.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.120
One more thing before.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.500
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.800
We do not run SSH clients on those Docker containers.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.040
This is an affordance that we get from Nomad.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:06.920
And I'm sure other cluster managers have that, too, that they allow you to enter containers from the outside.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.920
So, like, you SSH into the host, and that from there you get into the container.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.960
Right, right, right.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.320
That's SSH service.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.080
Yeah, I do that as well on my stuff.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:23.220
I've recently moved a couple, maybe a year or two ago, to running, I used to have a bunch of smaller servers.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:23.820
I don't know.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.160
Maybe I bought into the cloud computing.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.780
There's a bunch of commodity boxes, and you can just make a bunch of little ones, and that's the way you do it.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.760
And eventually, I'm just like, you know what?

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.880
I'm tired of dealing with all these servers.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.460
Putting them all in one thing, running everything in Docker, keeping it isolated.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.860
And it's been really excellent.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.660
So, similar access model there.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:51.860
I'm not sure this makes sense for you guys, but I think for folks who maybe expected still to SSH into their server and mess with it.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.840
Maybe this doesn't make sense for your customers, but maybe it does for you guys individually behind the scenes.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:03.500
I like to have a couple of tools, a little bit like you were saying with BusyBox, already installed in my Docker container.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:16.960
So, if I need to get into it and ask it questions, I can actually log in through some sort of Docker exec, you know, Docker exec, dash IT, sort of ZSH or bash or whatever, and ask it questions.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:17.880
What are your thoughts?

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:26.000
Do you think if you put something like, oh my Zshell, so you have better command history while you're poking around, is that sacrilegious in a Docker container?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.480
Or how do you feel about this?

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.120
You're asking me if you have a fancy.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.520
Well, we are sacrilegious in a different way.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.900
Like our normal servers that we SSH into, we run fish on them.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.160
Because most of us like fish.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:36.640
Yeah, sure.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.920
We have very nice fish prompts running there.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:45.240
Everybody who claims they have to use Bash on their notebooks because they have to SSH into servers, look at us.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.000
It's fine.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.280
You can do whatever you want.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.340
It's your servers, man.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:48.960
I'm with you.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.440
I don't have the strong opinions because like, as I said, we run everything on-prem.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.820
So, we have our own Docker registry.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.300
So, I'm not losing sleep over how big my containers are.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:05.740
Like, obviously, I try to keep the surface small because like everything you install can probably be misused in some way, can be a problem.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.620
Like XZ, for example, right?

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.620
Like, there's like things can be dangerous.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.440
But, I mean, if it helps you to get things done, whatever, right?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:14.700
Yeah.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:20.940
When you hear the security folks talk about living off the land, that's what they mean.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:30.200
They're like, oh, I somehow got into this machine and it turns out that this tool that I needed to access the database was just laying here and off it goes, right?

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.900
They didn't have to get anything on the server.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.420
So, that in a sense, you kind of want to eliminate.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:44.220
I do think the trade-off is, are you pushing to a Docker registry and shipping the thing all around or is it just being built in some local-ish story, right?

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:44.880
Interesting.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.340
Okay.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:57.320
So, the reason that I found out about your article, your virtual environment article, is I was actually looking around at your UV article.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.300
Because, wow, does UV speed up Docker builds?

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.140
Oh, yeah.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:01.720
Oh, yeah.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.460
Jay Miller made a comment just yesterday.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.060
I saw that.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.400
It was pretty funny.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.300
He said, UV is the new AI.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.080
And I suppose AI is the new blockchain.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.880
Like, everyone's excited about it.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.560
There's some minor level of controversy about it.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.900
But I'm a big fan.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.600
What are your thoughts on UV these days?

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.140
First of all, for people who don't know, we're talking a lot of two-letter acronyms.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.100
You said XZ earlier.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.680
Now, UV.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.220
Like, forget XZ.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:26.700
That was bad.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.800
But what's UV?

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:34.080
Well, UV is a reimplementation of Python packaging in Rust, roughly saying, right?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.760
In Rust.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.420
Yes, Rust.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:35.760
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.320
They started at the bottom.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.100
They implemented UV pip to replace pip.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.800
UVvnv to reimplement virtualenv.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.200
And UV compile, I think, was the thing.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.820
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.940
To do our good old requirements.txt files.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.300
And they did it very fast.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:57.000
And already back then, I said in a video, it's nothing new under the sun.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.140
It's like, we've got nothing new.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.520
But this is how you approach this problem.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.140
Because what I think most people don't understand, and this is a bit of a tangent,

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.020
is what an incredible Jenga tower Python's packaging is.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.660
Since, like, we've been building these things for 30 years, and there's so many loose parts.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.120
There's so many workflows that need to be supported.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:24.420
And, oh my God, I mean, just look at UV's bug tracker, what kind of workflows people need to have supported.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.200
Then you understand why it's hard.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:34.080
And why nobody before who did not have eight people, eight hours a day working on it to really move the needle.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.760
This portion of Talk Python is brought to you by WorkOS.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.040
If you're building a B2B SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:49.460
like SAML authentication, SKIM provisioning, audit logs, and fine-grained authorization.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:55.820
That's where WorkOS comes in, with easy-to-use APIs that'll help you ship enterprise features on day one

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.580
without slowing down your core product development.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.220
Today, some of the fastest-growing startups in the world are powered by WorkOS,

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.960
including ones you probably know, like Perplexity, Vercel, and Webflow.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:13.280
WorkOS also provides a generous free tier of up to 1 million monthly active users for AuthKit,

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.660
making it the perfect authentication layer for growing companies.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:22.080
It comes standard with useful features like RBAC, MFA, and bot protection.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.220
If you're currently looking to build SSO for your first enterprise customer,

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.080
you should consider using WorkOS.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.240
Integrate in minutes and start shipping enterprise plans today.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.560
Just visit talkpython.fm/workos.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.540
The link is in your podcast player's show notes.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.780
Thank you to WorkOS for supporting the show.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:48.100
With 0.3 or 0.0, they've now added proper workflow tools, which is very exciting, right?

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:55.140
Now we are attacking Poetry PDM and their own Rai, actually, which they adopted from Arm in Ronaha.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:00.700
And now we have cross-platform log files, which is very exciting for people like myself,

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:07.680
who develop on a Mac and an Arm Mac, no less, and deploy to Linux.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.240
Just asking for trouble there.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:09.700
Yeah.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.820
Just as you said, this is so incredibly fast.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.680
Like, UVSync, you can call it after every command.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:23.400
Like, the thing that makes sure that all your dependencies are at the state that is written in the log file,

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.720
is faster than git status.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.020
And I realized that.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.660
Then I realized what Charlie Marsh means, what he said on your podcast the other day,

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.920
that UV is categorically faster.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.500
It just enables a completely different lifestyle.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.400
Let's call it lifestyle.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.340
You behave differently when all those commands are free, basically.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.260
That's UV.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.260
It's a workflow tool.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.140
It also installs Python.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:52.140
Yeah, and I think one of, probably one of the things that I was most interested about,

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:52.820
your take.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.960
There was, over on Python Bytes, we covered this thing by Simon Willison,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:04.180
where he kind of summarized a Mastodon thread about UV and whether it being written in Rust

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.920
is detrimental to the Python ecosystem or not and all of those things.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.120
But I think it was there.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.600
Your take was, look, fast is interesting.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.760
But one of the really powerful things, I think, is here is a single binary that, if it's on your computer,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.820
you can do all things Python, right?

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.940
And right now, it's super, without UV, it's been really challenging, right?

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:33.400
Maybe I want to use pip-tools or I want to use pip to install something or all of those things are predicated on several steps.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.720
Do you have Python?

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.220
Do you have a right version of Python?

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:42.180
Have you realized you've got to create a virtual environment because you don't have right access to where there's just,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.580
before you can get started, like, well, here's a whole set of conversations you need to have about not terribly complicated things,

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.380
but things that people might not care about.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.920
And now with UV, it's just UV, run.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.360
And you can even put in the comment in the top, like, these are the three libraries I need to run.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.120
And it'll just run.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:58.980
Oh, so they don't break.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.420
That's what I meant with the one binary, right?

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:06.460
Like, I think most of Python's bad reputation around packaging is that things just break.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:13.760
Because Homebrew updated your Python or because you didn't activate your virtual length,

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.720
accidentally installed something into your global thing.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.200
Or you used pip install --user and now it's in all your virtual lengths and you don't know why.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.160
And there's so much unpredictability around these things.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.560
And now suddenly we have, like, this one thing that behaves in certain ways that people understand,

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.040
that people expect it to behave.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.620
As I said before, this is not necessarily the way I would like it to behave,

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:45.280
but I understand why it's so important to just narrow the envelope of packaging of the behaviors that we expect

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.300
and that we as a community endorse.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.220
Totally agree.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.200
There's certain things I would like to see different as well.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:56.000
But I'm really happy that Charlie and team are working on this and pushing it forward

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.420
and maybe breaking some paradigms or expectations, saying, look, you don't even have to have Python installed.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.000
We can base it off of, gosh, I forgot the name of the project.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.980
Not Dead Snakes.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.320
But the Python builds, yeah, builds standalone.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.200
That's it.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.760
Exactly.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.400
And we'll just grab it, right?

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.040
If you don't have Python installed, we'll just grab it.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:25.420
Now, a side issue or maybe a tangent parallel issue is I would love to see something in Python itself that gives you a binary that you can then deploy.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.200
UV is great for getting your machine up running and getting Python dependencies on it and stuff.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:35.580
But Python build my folder, my package with an endpoint or something.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.900
And like Go, like C++, whatever.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:39.680
Here's a binary.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.460
You just run it.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.780
It doesn't care what's on your machine.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.760
I know there's some packaging type stuff like Pyto app.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.180
I have an app that's based on that.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:55.540
But those are still kind of trying to piece things together in a funky way that Python will allow rather than something truly.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.720
It's the same like with the standalone builds.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.700
Python really fights you when you try to do this encapsulated things.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:09.140
And like my dream outcome would be if these standalone builds would be upstream to proper Cpython.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.780
Because this is really what I would like to have from Python.org.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.940
Like these directories that I can put anywhere and they just work.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.200
But it's not trivial.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:25.480
And the author, the original author of those standalone builds, because it's been taken over by Astro now too.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.940
But the original author was Gregory Shorts, I think.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:33.100
And he also did this PyOxidizer project, which was very exciting to me.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:45.660
But he kind of burned out completely on working with Python at all, because it was so frustrating for him to deal with these things and how Python behaves and fights him when he tries to do these things.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.520
Yeah, these kind of changes would have to come from Python proper.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.720
Yes, it would have to definitely come from Python proper.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.020
Well, maybe someday.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.580
There's some interesting things that come along.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.120
We might even have Python in the browser.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.460
Weirdest things have happened.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:04.500
Yeah, and out in the audience, Tony agrees that super powerful and I haven't thought much about it.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.100
One by any of the do everything, it's amazing.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:06.620
Indeed.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.760
So you want to talk about the controversies to you or just a segue?

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.720
Let me just ask you a question.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.420
So here, I think the controversy is twofold.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.280
And I accept that it's somewhat controversial, but I wouldn't say that it's controversial to me.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.480
I think there's two things.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.300
One, UV is written in Rust.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.480
Rough and Rust.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.840
Yeah, I see the challenge here.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.200
Yeah.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.420
It's written in Rust.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.840
It's not Python.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.840
That makes it harder.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.960
I don't know any Rust.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.780
I might be able to look at Rust codes.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.620
I think that's Rust, but I'd have to do some learning to actually do anything with it.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.320
And the other is venture-backed versus just open source.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.120
Like, is that healthy?

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.820
I think for the Rust part, like, for me, it's like, look, a lot of libraries are written

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.380
in C++.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.820
And I used to do C++ or C, but I'd rather not go do C.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.400
If there's a bunch of C and a bunch of Rust, they're kind of similar to me.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.800
Like, I'd rather not mess with those.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.420
But if I had to, I could learn a feeling.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.460
And so I don't feel terribly worried about Rust in that regard.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.420
What are your thoughts?

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.880
Just some quick takes on this.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.740
Yeah, the quick take is, I think it's a much more a thing of context right now.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.480
And it's actually how the thread on Mastodon started.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.160
We were just starting to get off having everything written in C.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.620
So we didn't have to learn C to contribute to certain projects.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.660
Because we ported them to Python.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:31.200
Like, now the Pyreple in Python 3.13, which I'm sure we were talking about, is now in Python.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.900
And suddenly we have more contributions, right?

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:38.380
Now, people find this is a regression back when we start moving back to Rust, which in certain

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.460
ways it is.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.660
But then again, I think people underestimate how many Rust-savvy people we have now in the

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.020
community.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.520
So I think the upsides in this case outweigh the downsides.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.760
But of course, everybody has to decide it themselves.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:52.340
Yeah.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.380
And it's open source.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.120
If something goes terribly wrong.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.580
Yes.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.760
MIT Apache 2.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.240
Yeah.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.700
Yeah.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.860
There's already 646 forks.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.760
I'm sure there'll be some more.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.260
I'm happy to see Charlie and team working on this.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.240
And I told Charlie that a few weeks ago or a couple of months ago when he was on the show

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.660
to talk about some of these ideas.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.020
I think what I would really like to stress here is that it's not like Astro came to the

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:20.180
page and just like forbade everybody to stop to do open source packaging.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:26.480
We had like at least 10 years of trying to tackle this problem with our resources that

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.960
we have as open source developers.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.320
And it turned out that we cannot do that.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.220
It's just a too complex problem.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.060
I've been like just a few months ago.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:38.680
I was literally saying that I would like to see someone to just put the money where their

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.560
mouth is and just bankroll a good packaging tool.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.120
And this is literally what just happened.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:49.660
So I'm more on the relaxed side of that because I realized that we just couldn't do it.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.360
Like we tried.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.540
We failed many times.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.040
Like there's a whole graveyard of packaging tools.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.660
And right.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.480
Now we have a good one.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.720
And one day we will probably have to maintain it because VC is going to VC.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.900
But it's fine.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.620
It's interesting.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.480
That is for sure.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.860
I definitely know if you want to get VC funding, having Rust as your foundation seems to be

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.700
the trick right now.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:13.800
But another thing I want, you know, while we're on this topic, you made a point in one of the

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.200
YouTube videos, which I'll give a shout out to in a bit, but said something to the effect

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.780
of be kind to all the people who have worked so hard on this problem before and don't just

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.300
trash on the other projects.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.040
Six months ago, this thing was mission critical to you.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.880
And it was the way that you did everything.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.620
And now I go, it's people know it's crap because you like, I don't, I think it's, it's important

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.520
to keep some perspective, you know?

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:36.840
Yeah.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.180
I mean, I've been on the receiving end of such excitement, so I know exactly how it feels.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:47.440
And it's just, you can be excited about something without saying that finally I can stop using

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:47.800
X.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.580
Ideally, add the maintainer of X.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.220
So they really know that you finally don't have to use their stuff.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.440
Yeah, exactly.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.360
You don't have to be.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.000
Come on now.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.740
So real quick, give us some of the tips of what you're doing to make your Docker builds

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.020
faster.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:08.480
I know this build cache mount thing is pretty interesting, letting you, I mean, I adopted

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.160
some of the ideas you got in here and some of my own and Docker builds so much faster.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.020
I mean, the most important thing is to have multi-stage builds, which means that you have

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:22.760
a separate container that builds your application, whether it's a virtual amphi-chip, as we said

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.760
before, which I like better.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.120
Or if you just build into a directory and then somehow get it over.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.720
Because you don't want to have a C compiler in all your production containers.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.100
So just a waste of space, as you said, living off the land.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.820
It's not good.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.040
You want to drop the hackers into a desert, not a lush forest.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.020
Exactly.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.720
I mean, they're still going to figure it out.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.680
But it's just nicer and easier to reason about.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:50.200
Then judicious layering makes a big difference that you are very clear about when you build

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.560
what, that you basically sort your commands in the order in that they are most likely to

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:55.940
change.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:01.760
So in a build container, that means that your last step is copying the application and the

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.840
step before is copying the dependencies.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.960
Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.780
And so I'll link to one of your articles here.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:13.660
But the other thing that I think is pretty interesting that people maybe don't realize or haven't used

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:19.700
a lot, I'm not sure if I see, here you go, is when you run Docker commands, you can say

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:24.080
--mount equals slash root slash dot cache.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.460
Yeah.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.140
That's build cache mounts that you mentioned.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:26.340
Yeah.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:26.900
Yeah.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.180
Yeah.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:27.400
Yeah.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.140
And what that'll do is when either, doesn't matter in this case, the way you got it set up,

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.000
either pip or UV, if they, a lot of times when you pip install something, they'll say,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.340
oh, that's already cached locally.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.380
We'll just install it instead of download it.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:38.560
Right.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:38.900
Yeah.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:44.480
And that'll store somewhere on the host machine, all the, all the cache stuff, right?

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.060
It depends.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.460
It depends.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:50.440
So this is something that I didn't spend a ton of time because you can configure where this

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.000
is stored.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.600
And in the simplest case, it is just pulled from the last container that you built.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:01.240
That is like the simplest configuration that you can use that you say that, so now I tag

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.920
an latest container, which I never did before because for deployments, I usually use numbers,

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.960
but now there's always a latest tag.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.180
It will take the cache from there.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.460
So it's most likely pretty good because it was literally the last build.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:13.720
Yeah.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:13.980
Yeah.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:14.420
Okay.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.100
Interesting.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:20.080
I see that it's, it's part of the build cache, not the Docker layer cache, not some folder

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:20.600
laying around.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.480
I think it's actually part of the container if I'm not mistaken completely.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:23.880
Okay.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.400
Yeah.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.200
So definitely lightens the load on PyPI a little bit and makes yourself faster.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.380
So that's all, that's all good.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:30.980
All right.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.140
What is next on my list here?

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:33.900
Let me have a look.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.320
All right.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.000
Installing Python.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.020
That's probably a, maybe a segue that keeps us in the same realm.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.980
Honestly, how do you get Python on your machine these days?

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.260
Are you, if you're going to work on something or do you brew install it or you download it

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.700
from python.org?

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:48.180
No.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:48.220
No.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.440
As my friend, Justin once wrote, homebrews Python is not for you.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.500
It's that Python is for homebrew to use in their applications.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.860
You notice it very fast because whenever they upgrade the Python audio virtual ends break.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.440
So this is not great.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:13.460
So I'm on macOS and I'm on an Apple Silicon Mac, which makes things a bit more complicated because

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:19.780
I need to develop some of my projects on Intel because I need to use a driver for a very shitty

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.600
proprietary database.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.000
And this, of course, they don't have that for ARM.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.820
It's written in C or some sort of binary layer.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.240
It's a binary blob.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.920
So I have like these two types of projects.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:40.000
And so the official macOS installer from python.org has this amazing property that you get Python

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.620
3.13-intel64.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:47.480
And when I create a virtual end with that, I know this virtual end is Intel.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.820
And if not, it's not.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.520
And this is very nice and predictable for me.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.400
So I really like this behavior.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.300
And on servers, we use dead snakes.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.040
Yeah, very cool.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:03.760
Lately, I've been switching to just UV, VE and V, give it a Python version, which I guess

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.580
indirectly is using Python build standalone, right?

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:11.320
They have a bunch of quirks based on the thing that we talked before that they fight, that

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.360
Python fights it a little bit.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.460
So I cannot use those in production, at least not for everything, because I just had some

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.920
some of my packages just won't install on them.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.560
They will probably be fixed at some point.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.820
But yeah, Python.org is a safe spin thing.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:29.360
And I have to shill my friends Glyph's tool mop up, which just allows you to upgrade those

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.020
official installers very easily, especially when you use UVX, because then it's just one

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:34.280
line.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:40.660
Yeah, mop up is an interesting project from Glyph, as you pointed out, that will update your

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.980
your Python, right?

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.400
Yeah.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:42.820
Yeah.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.560
If you've installed it from Python.org.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.060
All right.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:51.820
Another thing that's interesting, if you install Python from Python.org is in the installer,

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:58.060
you can customize it and you can check a checkbox that says, give me the free threaded Python.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.460
Let's talk about free threaded Python.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.560
What do you think about this?

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:06.480
This is one of the more significant changes to Python and one of the bigger peps.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.620
You know, we went through the two to three controversial challenges so much.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.300
And I think that was largely because strings were changed.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.900
I know there's a bunch of other changes, but it seemed to me that the real challenge of a

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:23.300
lot of the upgrades of a lot of the packages been like, well, that used to be bytes or strings.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.500
Now we've got to treat them differently and we've got to change that.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.760
That's the part that was really took the work.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.400
And threading seems harder than strings.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.200
I don't know.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.260
Maybe it's not, but is this going to be a big challenge for people or what do you think?

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.720
Yeah, I guess we will see, right?

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.600
Like normal code is probably not going to be affected a lot.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:45.460
But for example, it's a perfect timing since I'm maintaining Argon2 CFFI.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:50.840
As the name says, it depends on the CFFI project to do the bindings.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.960
It does not support free threading yet.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.860
So I cannot build free threading wheels with that yet.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.060
Of course, people are already complaining in my issues about that.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.520
Why isn't your puppy parallel?

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.840
Come on now, get this going.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.180
Yeah.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:09.840
So this is, there's probably more projects than just CFFI that are still stuck in some way

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:16.300
because they are not important enough for someone from meta being parachuted into the project

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.040
and fix everything.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:17.500
Yeah.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.480
I personally, I'm very excited by free threading.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.640
And I was like one of the, like, I mean, there was, I don't know how to call it, but

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.640
it's a bit of an election, right?

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.220
To decide on whether or not.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:34.340
And it was like this, we made public statements about how we feel about this whole thing.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:37.300
And I personally felt like good about it back then.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:37.920
I still do.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.920
I think it's a big chance, our one shot we will have because either this one works out

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.460
or it's not going to happen ever.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.840
We will never have free threaded Python ever because this is like the perfect constellation

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.460
of stars.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.660
This is not coming back.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.660
That's a really good point.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.440
We've had the Gilectomy and other attempts before, but this is, it's fast.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.380
It's accepted.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:58.580
It's already shipped.

00:31:58.580 --> 00:31:59.200
You're right.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.160
If this doesn't work.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:06.540
And we have meta who also like put several paid people on the job to get it done.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:11.560
Again, this is one of those things that just cannot be done by volunteers on the beer money

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.380
from GitHub sponsors.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:17.140
This is a big thing that has to be, that needs serious money to be solved.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.940
This portion of talk Python to me is brought to you by Bluehost.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.200
Got ideas, but no idea how to build a website?

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.300
Get Bluehost.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.380
Since you're listening to my show, you probably know Python, but sometimes it's better to focus

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:58.320
on what you're creating rather than a custom built website and add another month till you

00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.080
launch your idea.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:04.360
When you upgrade to Bluehost cloud, you get a hundred percent of time and 24 seven support

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.660
to ensure your site stays online through heavy traffic.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.500
Bluehost really makes building your dream website easier than ever.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.780
So what's stopping you?

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.060
You've already got the vision.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:14.840
Make it real.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.780
Visit talkpython.fm/bluehost right now and get started today.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.280
And thank you to Bluehost for supporting the show.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:26.220
I'm excited, but I don't think it's going to be that big of a problem.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:30.740
And I think it's going to do some very excited things that we are not thinking about because

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:35.120
a lot of the arguments against it was, oh, threads are bad.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.640
It's hard to write multi-threaded code, which is all true.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.520
The problem is that we just don't have good APIs for that.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.760
Like you can build good APIs for threading.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.820
You just have to look what Go is doing with channels.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:48.600
We can have channels in Python once we have good threading.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:53.800
But we never bothered to build these kind of APIs because it doesn't make any sense with

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.120
the guild.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.340
It's just, it's better to go async.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.860
That's a really good point.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.340
And I think there's an analogy with async.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:06.340
Remember, async.io shipped in Python 3.4, but async await, the keywords and the programming

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.640
model shipped in 3.5.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.720
So for a while, it was like, well, you guys figured it out.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.840
And then the programming model got way nicer.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:18.200
We might have not gotten this shot if async.io didn't happen back then because it just showed

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.680
how we can do like a test balloon in a community.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.260
We don't have to do it perfectly on the first time.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:32.000
I think we had even breaking changes in minor releases of 3.5 because we had to fix things

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:32.280
up.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.820
So yeah, I think I'm sure it was a bit of an inspiration.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:43.080
I remember a breaking change somewhere in Python, but further down the road where the async context.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:48.640
So the way to say a function was async, you could use a decorator before async and await

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.240
came along.

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:54.960
And my code, which was running on MongoDB, which was running on, which was using motor.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.600
They were using that older style to get their async.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.320
And then when it got taken out of Python, it just, well, stuff doesn't run anymore.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.280
There is no such decorator async, something I can't remember exactly what it was, but it

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.240
took a week or two before I could run the new Python because that wasn't a big deal.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.140
You know, I just didn't use it, but it did break.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:19.480
There was plenty of breaking changes in async.io because I was quite involved with that whole

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:19.760
thing.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.340
And I remember things breaking a lot in the beginning, but it's good.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.580
It's good that we don't carry that technical debt around with us now.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.600
Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:34.160
I want to give a quick shout out to a pytest plugin called pytest-FreeThreaded from Anthony

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.260
Shaw and friends.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:43.060
And this one basically lets you run your tests in the free threaded Python mode and run them

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.640
with parallelism and stuff like that.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.340
Because if you're going to have a library and you have tests for it and it's supposed to

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.700
support free threading, you should probably test it with free threading actually running

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.260
at some point.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:57.080
People are trying to move their libraries along and I think they said, look, we tested

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.620
this on one of the libraries that said it was free threaded, supporting it, segfaulted Python.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.200
So maybe it wasn't quite ready.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.160
So run your tests if you're going to support this.

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.800
I think it needs to be stressed that the trick to not break your code is to just not mutate

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.640
global data in multiple threads at once.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.120
Just avoid doing this and you'll be fine.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.340
And most people don't.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.040
So I don't expect like this large scale breakage.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:27.700
The problem is more in the lower level things like CFFI and those kind of things that are

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.960
going to take a lot of time to figure out, I think.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:30.780
Yeah, I agree.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.640
Like, does your web framework support free threading?

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.060
Well, you're going to find out pretty quickly.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.200
You definitely will.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.780
I'm personally excited about it as well.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.400
I think we're going to have a lot of good times.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.600
What else about 3.13 are you excited about?

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:53.260
I feel like Python 3.12 and 3.13 was more like planting trees than a good harvest, you know?

00:36:53.260 --> 00:37:00.300
Like, there's a lot of work, a lot of very, very hard work when it did these two releases

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.280
that don't benefit us immediately.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.040
They built a foundation for great things to come.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.540
Like, free threading is an example.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.520
Sub-interpreters are an example.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.720
Like, internally, I mean, I shouldn't admit it, but I'm also a Python core developer,

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.920
but I'm just not very active because I have enough of my own stuff going on nowadays.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.360
But internally, the 3.13 is kind of called like a secret 4.0,

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:27.040
which everybody who has to do with C-APIs have noticed because, like,

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.920
unlike the releases before, like 3.12, 3.11,

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:35.940
it took quite a while for the ecosystem to catch up with all the changes to the C-API

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.560
because there's been a lot of changes.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.700
I mean, the PyRipple is great.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.440
Pablo has made a big push for better error messages, which is also nice.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.680
And they continue to get better.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.640
Yeah, that's great.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.720
This is like the things that are truly user-facing,

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.440
but things that I don't really care about that much.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.540
I mean, I use IPython, so I will probably keep using it still.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.720
I just hope that maybe PDB will get better now that we have a better REPL

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.840
because my favorite debugger, PDBPP, has been broken for two releases.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.220
I'm not really excited about anything from 3.12 and 3.13.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.820
I'm just excited for what those releases are going to give us in the future.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:18.760
I'm excited for just the entire FasterCpython initiative as it kind of works out over across, you know.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.040
Yes.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.900
3.11 was probably the biggest one of those, I guess.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.920
Although, we'll see about this free threading.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:28.600
This might, you know, if you've got a lot of cores, that's a massive difference if you can take advantage of it.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.020
If, yeah, that's a problem, right?

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:40.360
Because I think what was said that they will merge it if the penalty for non-threaded code is less than 10%,

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:46.040
which it did, but single-threaded code is going to be slower in a free-threaded Python build,

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.300
and it's something we have to keep in mind.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.120
Right, yeah.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.400
Well, I guess it depends on your workload, what you're doing right.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.880
But with little dev tools, I fixed.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.520
What's new in Python 4?

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.640
Ship it.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.560
Ship it.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.820
Although, I got a few more spots.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.200
I got to do a little find and replace in this documentary.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.180
Looking at the what's new in 13.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.700
Okay, also, I think, yeah, I think the new REPL is quite nice.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.880
It's been, using the traditional REPL, I think it's been really challenging.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.620
Did you write a loop?

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.540
You want to go back and edit it?

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.600
Well, you got to, yeah, I remember that was four lines up for the four part,

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:23.940
and then the four again to get, you know, like, that was just challenging to have multi-line edits on there.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:24.980
Now, a lot nicer.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:31.220
Well, just simple things like key binding, sometimes not working, or just printing weird stuff into your console.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:39.160
Yeah, but these are the things kind of like the virtual environment, you know, get your virtual environment set up, get your dependencies installed.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.320
It doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but it is friction to people who come to the ecosystem.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.160
Every paper cart less is good.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.980
Yeah, that's 100% right.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.820
Definitely good.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.540
YouTube.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:54.380
I mean, look, you're on YouTube right now, but we're talking about you being on YouTube on YouTube, so it's kind of meta.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:58.900
But, yeah, you're doing a really good job with your YouTube videos lately, you know.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.860
Thank you so much.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.020
I've done a couple of the last, yeah, yeah, you're welcome.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:09.720
I think I've done a lot of YouTube videos, but even more, sit down by yourself behind a camera for course videos.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.280
I have like 270 hours of course videos.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:17.500
And, you know, the editing, the I'm excited to talk to nobody, right?

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.520
All of these things are not that easy to do.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.940
And, yeah, I want to just talk about what you're up to over there a bit.

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.720
Maybe let's start with a silly reason why I started doing this.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.980
I'm very aware and self-conscious about how bad my spoken English is.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.180
So it's my third language.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.280
And I don't speak it often enough.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:43.700
So there's this joke from my friends at the Piken when the just arrived jet-lagged Hinek who only spoke English to the U.S. immigration officer trying not to get detained.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:49.380
It's very different from the Hinek like a week later who spoke to his friends for a week, right?

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:56.140
So my hope is that maybe it forces me to like speak a lot more English in my everyday life.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.380
It turned out I'm way too slow at producing videos.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.900
So that part didn't work out at all.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.320
I mean, you say like 300 hours.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:10.260
But for me, like the 25-minute video that I've just published, that's like one hour of film material that I'm cutting down to 25 minutes.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:10.640
Yeah.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.760
So that's a lot of work, a lot of editing.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:19.000
And, yeah, the more serious reason that actually worked out, and this is not going to be all of Philly.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.360
is I do have a lot of people that follow me across my platforms and know me from PyCon.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:32.300
And I've heard the term PyCon cinematic universe put out, which I'm probably a part of.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.660
But this universe is tiny.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.720
Like the Python community is huge.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.080
People don't understand how huge they are.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:45.320
And I mean, just like this Twitter account that posts just like these trivial things that sometimes I'll write wrong.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.840
And they have like hundreds of thousands of followers.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.080
And the same is on YouTube.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:57.120
I haven't found any Python content on YouTube that I really liked, like for the things that I care about.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.340
Like maybe there's amazing data science stuff there, but there's not things that I care about.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.780
So I thought with the usual programmers hubris, sure, I can do that.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.440
And I'm trying to build our own.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.020
We're doing it.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.360
How hard can it be?

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:14.520
And so I'm trying to do content that I wish existed for me 15 to 20 years ago.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:23.960
But to be honest, like the ultimate trigger is that before COVID, I had like this nice lifestyle where I wrote one amazing conference talk per year, like scare quotes.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.480
And I could just like travel the world and give it.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.700
And this doesn't work anymore.

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.240
Like the conference world has more or less collapsed.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.160
Conferences have no money anymore.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.720
It's much harder to get invited.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:39.320
So I told you I work for a small company.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.620
So like my actualization and creativity comes mostly from the community.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.040
And I felt like being cut off.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:50.900
Like I couldn't do my creative work anymore because I couldn't pay for all those flights.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.320
The same happened to writing.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:43:01.320
I mean, whatever Google and Twitter are doing right now, unless your blog post lands on Hacker News front page, you basically get no more traffic anymore.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.520
It has been completely obliterated.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.060
Like my blog has like 40% less traffic than a year ago.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.620
And I don't think it's that my content got stale.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.620
It just changed.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.280
I thought I should try a new avenue.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.700
I should go where the people are.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:19.080
I read somewhere that like YouTube is the second biggest search engine or something.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.180
So I'm trying my hand.

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.900
It's an interesting outlet.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.300
And you know, you look at it's the numbers are ridiculous.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:26.820
Right.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:30.020
I look at, oh, this person just posted a video on this.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:35.840
And six hours later, it has more views than if it was a major television series or something like this.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.720
It's a weird world.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.020
It's a weird world for sure.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.360
I'm a niche in a niche.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.980
So I don't expect ever to blow up like this.

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.380
But yeah, we'll see how it goes.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.920
It's still great.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.740
Let's talk a little bit about some of your projects.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.180
Talked about Argon.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:54.120
I think maybe one of the things you're best known for might be Adders.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:54.820
Would you say?

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.620
It depends who you ask.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:56.860
Okay.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:06.000
I think Adders has the big, had the biggest impact on the community because they are the direct predecessor of data classes that I designed with Guido and Eric back then.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.820
That goes back to Adders because people wanted something like Adders in a standard library.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.100
But all right.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.500
Well, tell us, tell people about Adders for those who don't know.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.440
Imagine data classes, but more powerful, more powerful.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:22.400
People sometimes try to compare it to PyDentic, but that's not that.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.180
Adders is not trying to be a validation thing.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:29.660
Adders is there for creating classes that you would have written yourself.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.580
And I call it like a class writing toolkit.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:38.240
And data classes keep catching up with what we do, but we are still ahead.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.540
So we have more features.

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.340
We work better.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:47.720
And especially for data science-y things, because we allow people to define comparisons in a custom way.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.720
So you can compare NumPy arrays and everything.

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.120
And yeah, things like that.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.800
And you don't need to use type annotations if you hate them.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.320
That's also a big feature we have.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:57.680
Yeah.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:02.420
So when you create a class, you can just put some fields on it and that's great.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:12.260
But there's probably some other things you might want to do, like define a hash and define an equals and an not equals and stir and a repr and all these kinds of things.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:12.820
Right?

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:13.180
Yeah.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.940
You just get that out of the box, right?

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.020
And maybe you want the class to be frozen.

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:20.080
Maybe you want slots and these kind of things.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:20.600
Slots.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.080
Interesting.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:22.160
I don't know.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.160
Everyone knows about slots.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.060
Slots are kind of a cheat code for low memory, fast access.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:29.720
Tell people about slots.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.340
Dunder slots.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:39.660
When you create a class in Python, by default, it's a so-called dictionary class because it has a dunder dict field where all the attributes are defined.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.880
And you can do those classes whatever you want.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.260
You can just add more attributes.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:54.380
But if you define a slotted class, which doesn't have this dunder dict, but dunder slots, and you enumerate all attributes that this class will have, and it's then baked into the class.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:55.940
So this is the big upside.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:04.540
It's like, if you try to assign an attribute that doesn't exist, it will throw an error, which is good because it probably means that you mistyped.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:09.740
And this is like the thing that you see from the outside, from the inside, it's much more interesting because those classes are more baked.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:10.900
So they are just faster.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.620
They're faster and use less memory.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.800
Yeah, they use quite a bit.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:20.600
I think named tuples use more memory, you know, and you think how tuple is kind of like as about as bare bones as it can get.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.420
But yeah, it's quite interesting.

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:28.720
My experience is that even attribute access is a tiny bit faster than in regular classes.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.220
Yeah, and this is why in the new APIs, it's the default in others.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:36.220
Like data classes grew slots too, but it's optional in others.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:39.300
It's now opt out because it's really good.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:39.880
Yeah, yeah.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.280
Because why not?

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:49.340
My experience is it's cool to have the dynamic nature of classes and types and you can do all sorts of stuff to change them.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.680
But most of the time you don't.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:57.300
And if you're not going to, like you said, get the I mistyped something catch because it won't let you do it.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.840
And the better memory and better performance, right?

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.560
Yeah, I think this is something that Rust has changed too.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:10.200
The influence of Rust on Python has been that we got a little less dynamic with time, which I personally think is a good thing.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.900
Because I started moving away from that sooner.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.260
Like using dictionaries and tuples and all these things.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:22.240
It's just very hard to reason about when you come back like a year later and try to understand what this code is doing.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.540
What is this star star KWRX thing?

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:25.320
What are we doing here?

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.360
Oh yeah, there's still so many APIs.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.880
You have a nice IDE.

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.240
You press F12.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.880
You jump to the function and it's star star KWRX.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.560
And thank you.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:36.680
Yes, exactly.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:44.220
You know, if that works out well, there might be a big doc string that says these are the seven things that can actually go in this keyword arguments.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.480
And here's their type.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.900
You're extra lucky it's true.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:51.440
Yeah, it's actually true or it's actually comprehensive.

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.140
Yeah.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:52.800
I don't know.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:59.640
I feel a lot of times if when you're doing that kind of stuff, if you end up back in the documentation, like something's kind of gone a little bit wrong.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.880
Like you should probably be able to tell at least, does it take arguments?

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.820
What might they possibly be?

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.400
But then you go to the documentation, it's auto generating.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.980
Like, well, no, not getting far on this one.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:10.620
All right.

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:16.460
Well, since we have this, the opinion of Hennick episode, what are your thoughts on types?

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.140
What do you think?

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:24.620
Like I just said, I was moving to like more static things in general because it's just easier to reason about, easier to understand.

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:34.800
And it informs the design of APIs too, like which I just find the APIs that come out nowadays are widely more accessible than what we used to have.

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:41.900
And as Lukasz Langer's keynote a few years ago at PyCon US was like, if something is hard to type, maybe it's just bad design.

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:43.360
That's an interesting take.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:43.620
Yeah.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.160
It's not always true, by the way.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:50.220
Like there are legitimate use cases for Python where typing is a bad fit.

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.640
It's completely true and it's not great for everything.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:49:03.600
But I personally just take any help that I can get that helps me to make my code more understandable and help me like ensure that I'm writing what I'm thinking I'm writing.

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:11.720
Like types helped me the best with finding logic errors in what I thought I was passing around and what I was actually passing around.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:20.640
Because like things that work by accident because something gets auto-converted somewhere are the most dangerous things because they explode when you are on the beach with your margarita.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.560
Yeah, they do.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.480
And that's not good, as we already pointed out.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:29.460
You know, another thing that I really like about them, I'm kind of on your team with this one as well.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.760
And I really like that I hinted at before.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.420
You don't have to go to the documentation and go like, what is this?

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.440
I know it says it takes an options.

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.400
What is an options?

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.300
You know, like I have no idea what goes here still.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.060
This doesn't tell me.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:47.080
But if it means it's this class or it's a dictionary, well, at least you got some hints on like, well, this is where I start knowing what I'm supposed to do here.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:49.300
And also with the editor, right?

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:55.020
If I hit dot, it gives you a way better chance of just continuing to type instead of going and looking up stuff.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:50:00.520
And also, that's something people don't talk that much about, but it forces you to give things names.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:08.320
Sometimes when you have problems to give a type a name, that's a sign that you don't quite understand what the thing is doing.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.800
Or maybe it's doing too many things.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:15.360
And that way you have like this instant feedback about your design and how you think about things.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.160
And that I find very useful.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:22.780
And also, I have to point is, typing would be just marking things that could be none or not.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:27.020
That would be already like 99% of the value of types.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:31.220
Like just helping to avoid non-type errors.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:31.520
Yeah.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.980
Optional or not optional?

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:33.880
What are we going to do here?

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.260
Yeah.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:34.880
Yeah.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.260
I do like that it's optional, that it's progressive.

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.720
I came from static languages to Python.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.500
And the fact that it didn't have types, I kind of wanted something.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.880
But I also played around with TypeScript.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:53.960
I battled with the TypeScript system where it's like, well, we don't know what this thing is, but you're supposed to pass in something that's known in the type system.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.400
And you're like, I know this will work.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.160
Just get out of my way and let me do it.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:57.740
You know what I mean?

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.240
And I think there's a pretty good balance that's got here.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:05.920
I have a whole keynote in my head about the true Python superpower is the graduality.

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:18.000
Because you can start with the biggest trash, shitty code in a Jupyter notebook and just work yourself up by putting it in a file, running rough linter, then adding types and so on.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.340
And you end up with production code of the best kind.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.060
But you started with complete shit.

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.240
And that's how my brain works.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.460
Like, I like to try things out and then just polish the turds, must I say.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:33.040
Polish it when it's proven that it's worth putting your time and energy to, right?

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:33.420
Exactly.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.840
And I find this very frustrating with languages like Rust or Go, which I read a lot of Go.

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.580
And Go won't even compile your thing if you have an unused import.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.180
And this is just so frustrating.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.120
Oh my gosh.

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.880
Just eat my trash and make it work.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.120
I will fix it later.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:48.620
I promise.

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.140
That's a pretty interesting take.

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:50.620
All right.

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:55.720
Well, let's give maybe a shout out to Stamina also.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.700
Like, that's the story of Stamina.

00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:58.160
That's a good one.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:58.640
Yeah?

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:04.260
It's like from my latest projects, kind of the most popular one, because it just solved

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.200
the problem we all have that we use Tenacity, which is a great.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.760
We all used Tenacity, which is a great package, but it has no good default because it's also

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.600
a very old package.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:20.780
And everybody's just copy pasting these standard settings around that make it behave in a good

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:21.080
way.

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.960
And it's also, at least back then, didn't do proper typing.

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:29.500
So I just wrote this tiny shim around that so I can stop copy pasting the same things

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.340
over and over again.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.220
It turns out a lot of people have the same problem.

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:32.760
Yeah.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:37.360
So if you've got a function, for example, I give a little example here that might crash

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.320
because it's here.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.720
Like, you know what?

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.560
If I just tried this again, I bet it would work.

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.040
Right?

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.800
Just add stamina dot retry.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.920
Specify the error.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.300
Yep.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:50.240
And I don't, it's been a while since I checked it out, but it's got like exponential back

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.180
off and other, other types of things like.

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:52.520
And jitter.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.140
Oh, and jitter.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:53.440
Okay.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:53.820
Nice.

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:54.340
Yeah.

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.620
I use it in certain things.

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:59.940
It's not very often that you need something like this, but when you do, you're like, oh,

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:00.860
yes, it's getting this.

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:05.000
Like in my experience, you need it whenever you talk to external systems, because if you're

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.140
doing this API cost, it will fail at some point.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:08.540
And just, just put it on it.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:09.800
Just think.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.220
I mean, nowadays it has a lot of more features.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:16.820
Like you can now like have a callable that decides where you want to really want to retry.

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.500
For example, you've got an HTTP error, but in HTTPX, there's no difference between HTTP error

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:25.080
because you got a 500 back or because you got a 401 back.

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:29.660
If you keep retrying on 401 or 403, you will get banned from the API, right?

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.900
On the 500, you probably want to retry.

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:32.840
These kind of things.

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:33.520
Yeah, absolutely.

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.820
Yeah, the whole rate limiting thing.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.460
That's also tricky to work with.

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:42.360
But I suppose if you said, like, okay, well, retry it, but put some kind of delay, you know,

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:44.000
maybe, maybe you'll be all right.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.140
The delay is built in.

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.140
That's the whole point.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.340
It's exponential back off.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.880
One thing I do want to talk about as well is just Argon.

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.340
Yes.

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.700
So quick, like very, very cool algorithm.

00:53:54.380 --> 00:54:00.780
It's one of these so-called memory hard problems that is somewhat resistant to brute forcing

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:03.420
over just massive parallelism and so on.

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.620
Want to talk about that real quick?

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:05.400
What do you want to hear?

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.300
Well, just tell people what it is.

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:10.920
Maybe, you know, what's your project about and what should people consider using it, you know?

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.240
Yeah.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:15.760
So many, many years ago, I think it was like 2016 or so, there was this password hashing

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:22.480
competition because we needed to find a way to hash our passwords in a way that is, as

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.640
you just said, memory hard.

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:28.060
If you hear of rainbow tables, you shouldn't be using MD5.

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:29.900
All these things are like all part of that.

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.180
Like we got to get past that, right?

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:33.800
But this is like next level because people are running ASICs.

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:40.060
So like programmable boards that are just specifically for cracking passwords in parallel.

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:44.160
The only way to get to fight this is make it memory hard.

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:49.700
like checking these passwords or hash, this hashing algorithm also needs a lot of memory

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:50.600
to work.

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:56.200
There's one more famous one, which is called S-crypt or Yes-crypt, which is nowadays also

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.380
part of the standard library.

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.060
So that's that.

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.740
But Argon2 won the password hashing competition.

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.420
And yeah, it works.

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.840
It's in wide use.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:10.360
And yeah, I'm maintaining it for now like six years or something, or I think longer.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:15.540
So if you're storing your own passwords, certainly this is one of the good options.

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:18.600
Do you know what the story is with, oh gosh, what is it?

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.060
Is it passlib, I believe?

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:26.100
Yeah, this is really, passlib is throwing a lot of warnings about things that it's using

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:28.480
that are being deprecated or even removed.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.680
I feel like it was really great for a while, but you know, now you go to it, it's like...

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.520
Yeah, last edited four years ago, that's a problem.

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:38.000
Yeah, it's not great.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.000
And I feel like it was on, almost on SourceForge or something for a while, which is really, you

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.340
know, I can't remember exactly where I was talking about.

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:44.580
Bitbucket.

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.920
It was in Bitbucket.

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.460
Bitbucket's fine.

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:46.760
Yeah, okay.

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.500
Bitbucket's fine.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.200
No, it's not.

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.200
It's gone.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.880
Oh, is Bitbucket gone?

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.480
Yeah, more or less.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.360
You can see the URL.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:56:00.760
This is a Heptapod, which is like the only Mercurial hosting that open source projects

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:01.580
can use nowadays.

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:02.520
There you go.

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.300
Bitbucket, deprecating Mercurial support, yeah.

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:08.120
All right, but well, they also have Argon2 support, which is nice.

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:09.540
They use my library.

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.360
Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.160
Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.280
Yeah, super cool.

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:12.860
Awesome.

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:17.380
All right, let's close this out with one more take before, I think we're pretty much out

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:19.100
of time, but it's been a lot of fun.

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:19.940
LLMs.

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:22.180
LLMs writing code for us.

00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:25.100
Are we just going to be out of work in a year or two?

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.640
What do you think about this?

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.220
I'm not super worried about it, but it's definitely changing things, I think.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:33.580
When you say we, it can mean we, the two of us.

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.020
The answer is clearly no.

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:39.460
I think we, as in Michael and Hinnick, will benefit from LLMs, I think.

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:46.580
But we, as programmers in general, and especially junior programmers, that's going to be a different

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:46.840
thing.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:51.660
And I wouldn't dare to guess how that will play out.

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:55.400
Like, I'm personally using LLMs.

00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.160
I use Anthropic.

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:05.180
But I use it in a way that I feel like you have to be very senior to actually use that.

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:11.120
Because when you ask it for code, you just get code with old libraries because it's trained

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:14.100
on old code from GitHub, right?

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:20.960
My co-pilot once gave me a SQL injection code suggestion.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.760
It'll be fine.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.640
What is the most common security problem with code?

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:26.520
Yeah, SQL injections.

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:30.100
Of course, it's going to be in those LLMs and suggesting it to me.

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:32.400
I think it's going to, it is a useful tool.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:38.540
It usually doesn't give me what I need, but it gives me enough to help me to ask a search

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.100
engine what I actually need.

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.580
So this is what I'm going to say.

00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:46.240
What it's actually really good for is writing SQL in my experience, because my brain, I somehow,

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.000
I cannot write CTEs.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.220
Like, I just, the syntax, I don't know.

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:51.960
I just can't.

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:57.000
So I usually ask an LLM to write the CTE for me and then just write the rest of the query.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.640
Well, for me, that's regular expressions.

00:57:58.640 --> 00:57:59.920
That's why I go to LLMs.

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:05.000
I'm like, you need to write me a regular expression with some capture groups because this is too much

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:05.300
for me.

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:09.520
I've been using LM Studio, which is really nice.

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:14.180
It lets you download a bunch of different models and been running Llama and Mistral lately,

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:15.940
and they've both been pretty good.

00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:17.480
Yeah, but they run locally, right?

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.440
They run, it's free.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.240
It's super nice.

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:24.440
One thing that's pretty interesting here is if you talked about this as well, and I don't

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.720
know what this trend means.

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:30.180
If you go to Stack Overflow Trends and you look at the most popular languages and you look

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:39.380
right around late 2022, early 2023, there is a ridiculous drop in the popularity of questions

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:44.860
on Stack Overflow for Python, for JavaScript, and interestingly, not a whole lot for the others.

00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.540
But that's when ChatGPT came out.

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:47.860
Yeah.

00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:48.600
All right?

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:53.020
So I don't know what it's going to mean, but it's clearly having some kind of effect somewhere,

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:53.380
right?

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:57.160
I don't know, but that might just be making people more productive and they're not on Stack

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:57.720
Overflow, right?

00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:00.800
That might be a Stack Overflow problem, not a developer ecosystem problem.

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:07.780
The friction to ask LLM is much, much smaller than asking actual people and then get some,

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.260
get trolled by some moderator or whatever.

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:16.840
So I can see that people are going to prefer LLMs to talking to people.

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.520
And also most questions on Stack Overflow are quite trivial, to be honest.

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.780
So I think that makes sense.

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:24.240
How do I connect to a database using this library, right?

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:29.840
How do I disable SSL because I'm getting this certificate error all the time, the classics.

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.080
But it also means that a lot of trash code is being written right now, right?

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:38.020
Like the things that I just told you that where you and I, we look at this code and we say,

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:44.180
okay, this in principle is useful, but I cannot put this into production because error handling

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:47.100
is wrong or there's some security issue or whatever.

00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.320
This is something that actually concerns me.

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:53.240
Like a lot of people are writing code they don't understand or putting into production.

00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:56.880
And I think that's going to have consequences that are not going to be pretty.

00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.740
Yeah, I totally agree with you.

00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:03.500
And also my, one of my concerns you touched on as well is like, how do you go from beginning

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.160
developer to slightly beyond junior developer?

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.680
I don't know if LLMs are going to help people make that jump quicker or if they're just going

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.920
to make that jump like a wider chasm because people won't need juniors because they're just

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.160
going to ask the LLM to just do the thing, you know?

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:18.580
Yeah.

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:18.820
Yeah.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:19.840
This is, this is the problem.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:25.460
Like, like bean counters are going to look into Excel and I got to wonder what makes more

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:26.020
sense, right?

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:31.840
And the fact that they're eating their seed for next year and there's suddenly, oh my God,

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.660
why are there no new senior software engineers?

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:38.780
Well, we didn't make them, but yeah, it's going to be like a Cobalt.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:43.280
Fewer people who are really, really needed to keep things working.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.800
We will never retire, Michael.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:45.640
You will never retire.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:45.840
Exactly.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.980
Yeah.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:50.420
We're going to be programming on the beach with our margaritas in our seventies.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.140
Well, let's leave it there.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.280
Is that a positive take?

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:54.600
I don't know.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.160
I really enjoyed our conversation though.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.600
And a lot of good advice for people.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.840
So thanks for being here.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.120
