00:00:00 On this episode, I'm joined by Dr. Jeff Boeing, an assistant professor at the University of Southern California,

00:00:05 whose research spans urban planning, spatial analysis, and data science.

00:00:09 We explore why OpenStreetMap is such a powerful source of global map data,

00:00:14 and how Jeff's Python library, OSMNX, makes that data easier to download, model, and visualize with Python.

00:00:21 Along the way, we talk about what shapes city streets around the world, how urban design influences everything from daily commutes to disaster resilience,

00:00:30 and why turning open data into accessible tools can open up completely new ways of understanding

00:00:36 our cities. If you've ever wondered how to build or analyze your own digital maps in Python,

00:02:11 Jeff, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:02:13 - Thank you for having me.

00:02:14 - It's great to have you here.

00:02:16 We're gonna talk maps and consuming map data a lot of interesting research that you've done with that data.

00:02:23 So you have a very cool project, OSMNX, Open Street Map Network X, that we're going to dive into.

00:02:31 And it really makes all of this street and map data super accessible to users of Python, right?

00:02:37 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:02:39 Excellent. I'm really looking forward to talking about that.

00:02:40 Before we dive into it though, just a quick introduction.

00:02:44 Who are you?

00:02:44 - My name is Jeff Boeing.

00:02:45 I'm an assistant professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. I'm in its Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis. And

00:02:55 most of my research and teaching are around that intersection of urban planning and spatial analysis. I did my PhD in city planning at UC Berkeley and

00:03:05 my focus is on urban data science. So using Python tools, usually open data, to

00:03:11 try to understand cities and housing markets and transportation networks and

00:03:16 how people move through space, how we can make our cities more resilient

00:03:21 to natural disasters, which is relevant in LA this week.

00:03:24 Also more equitable, nicer places to walk around, and basically just better for urban living.

00:03:31 - Okay, well, that sounds like amazing, amazing research.

00:03:35 It's probably interesting to live in LA as one of the bigger, crazier locations

00:03:40 in terms of traffic and congestion and population.

00:03:43 It's not New York in terms of density, but it's probably its own special beast, I imagine.

00:03:48 - Yeah, it is.

00:03:49 LA is an ironic place to be an urban planning professor because it can be so frustrating

00:03:54 for a lot of our best practices in urban planning, but at the same time,

00:03:58 there is no better place in the US to be studying and trying to intervene into some of these crises

00:04:04 that urban planning has wrought.

00:04:06 - Yeah, yeah, a lot of it was just, I imagine in the early days, just a free for all, right?

00:04:11 There was people, especially out in the West, right?

00:04:14 the US West, people just move out there and there's not a whole lot going on.

00:04:18 So when a city just neighborhoods go that way and not quite enough density for a lot of public transit

00:04:24 makes it challenging.

00:04:26 And then they become huge cities but they're stuck with those consequences.

00:04:29 Like LA and other cities. - Yeah, exactly.

00:04:30 And it's hard to retrofit a city once it's built out because those are people's homes and private properties

00:04:36 that you can't just cut from whole cloth, lay down the new city plan.

00:04:40 - Yeah, yeah.

00:04:41 Are there cities out there that are basically planned from scratch?

00:04:46 - Yeah, there are places like Brasilia, the capital of Brazil was a master planned city

00:04:54 in the modernist era, mid-century city planning where it's designed to look almost like the shape

00:04:59 of an airplane for the jet age, a modern city for the jet age.

00:05:03 - Amazing.

00:05:04 - But there's a wide range of how cities come to be.

00:05:08 Some of them are very organic, like you think old medieval cities have formed over centuries.

00:05:14 There are places like LA that built out very rapidly, or like in Chicago, all these straight lines

00:05:20 following from these 19th century ideas of rationality and orthogonal street networks.

00:05:28 And then there are these master plan cities where strong central leadership lets you lay it down

00:05:33 however you think is best.

00:05:36 - I imagine that how the cities are built has a lot to do with the people who helped construct the city

00:05:43 or there in the early days, how they perceived distance.

00:05:46 People perceived distance in LA by how far can you go in a car in 20 minutes.

00:05:51 The people perceived distance in Stuttgart, how far can you walk?

00:05:55 Maybe you can take a horse, potentially.

00:05:58 And that really probably changes things.

00:06:00 - Yeah, you know what, one way we talk about that idea of the perception of distance

00:06:04 and how the urban form shapes up is this idea of transportation technologies

00:06:09 And in general, you really see something of a death of geography.

00:06:15 That is, if you look at a 1990s suburb of Philadelphia or of Los Angeles, they look

00:06:22 very similar to each other.

00:06:24 You don't see that sort of local culture.

00:06:27 What you see is really building around the transportation technology and design aesthetic

00:06:32 of the era, rather than the local hands building the place up.

00:06:36 And it's, you know, when cars are how you get around, you build a city, it's designed for cars.

00:06:41 - Yeah, and then the cars get to be huge SUVs and they still don't fit.

00:06:45 All right.

00:06:47 Let's talk, you have this really cool visualization, which I'm going to link to in the show notes,

00:06:53 called City Street Orientations Around the World.

00:06:56 And it's got some pretty wild graphics.

00:07:00 You wanna tell people about this and kind of try to describe it for the folks listening?

00:07:04 Yeah, so what these show is the orientation of your city streets.

00:07:10 By orientation, we mean on a compass.

00:07:12 Like, do they point north, south, east, west?

00:07:15 Are they off that north, south, east, west orientation?

00:07:19 Or do your streets point more chaotically in all directions around the compass?

00:07:23 Like, there isn't a more consistent orientation.

00:07:26 So to visualize these, I used what's basically just a histogram, but it's a polar histogram.

00:07:33 So where a normal histogram will count your observations across some set of bins, for a polar histogram,

00:07:40 we've wrapped those bins around the circle of a compass so that each bin represents 10 degrees around the compass.

00:07:49 And there's 36 bins total for 360 degrees around the circle.

00:07:53 And then the length of each of the bars in those bins represents the frequency of streets

00:07:59 pointing in that direction in the city.

00:08:02 So in a place like Chicago or Beijing on screen here, most of the streets point north, south, east, west.

00:08:11 And what that tells us is it's kind of grid-like.

00:08:14 And this is common in a lot of cities around the world.

00:08:16 Even a lot of pre-modern cities would still orient themselves generally north, south, east, west,

00:08:22 just based on patterns where the sun was rising and setting.

00:08:25 - Yeah, I'm super surprised to see, for example, of Barcelona is pretty, not north-south,

00:08:30 but it's 90 degrees.

00:08:32 - Yeah, so in Barcelona, you see that 19th century and early 20th century, Example development.

00:08:40 So around medieval old Barcelona, El Defensor de la Dada laid out his grand city plan

00:08:46 that is fairly grid-like around it.

00:08:48 You can really see that here.

00:08:49 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:50 For people listening, some of them look like airplane fore-blade propellers,

00:08:54 and some look maybe like boat propellers, like really dense, but yeah, it's quite wild

00:08:59 to get a quick look.

00:09:01 Do we have LA in there?

00:09:02 We must, right?

00:09:04 - I have LA in the big one.

00:09:06 If you scroll down, we have American cities.

00:09:08 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:10 Okay. - Yeah, there it is.

00:09:11 - That's a pretty stark contrast.

00:09:12 It's like all of them are propeller looking.

00:09:15 Other than Boston and interestingly, Charlotte.

00:09:18 Boston has a city. - Yeah, really interesting.

00:09:19 - Yeah, but Charlotte doesn't feel like a city like that to me, but what do we have?

00:09:23 - Yeah, so Boston is kind of one of those pre-modern, American cities. And its street orientation looks like that for a couple

00:09:32 of reasons. One, Boston is an agglomeration of multiple smaller towns over several centuries and each of them had grids to some extent but they didn't

00:09:41 all face the same way so they all got merged together. And then it has a lot of

00:09:45 hills that made it harder to build especially in early days and it would

00:09:49 really predated America's obsession with grids. Charlotte is kind of the opposite

00:09:54 it's late 20th century, the sort of winding streets and cul-de-sacs to make up those arterial roads

00:10:02 and then these sort of secluded in the center super blocks of subdivisions.

00:10:07 - Nice, well I'm happy to see that Portland, where I live, is like a perfect propeller blade shape.

00:10:12 You know, in our town, you have northeast, northwest, southeast, and then street numbers,

00:10:17 like northeast 120th street, right?

00:10:20 And it just screams we're on a perpendicular North Southeast West grid and it definitely shows up here.

00:10:27 And so this is some of the stuff that you came up with OSM NX.

00:10:31 - Yeah, so I used OSM NX to build all of these street network models from OpenStreetMap data.

00:10:38 And then OSM NX has built into it a visualization module that creates these kind of polar histograms

00:10:45 to understand how streets are oriented.

00:10:48 - Awesome, it's super interesting.

00:10:49 Let's, it's like it communicates to you just immediately as you look at it, it's great.

00:10:55 Let's start by talking about OpenStreetMap.

00:10:58 This is the backing data, obviously, the important backing data of your library.

00:11:03 So what's the origin of OpenStreetMap?

00:11:07 - Yeah, so OpenStreetMap started maybe 20 years ago or so.

00:11:12 For folks who haven't seen it before, I often describe it as being akin to Google Maps meets Wikipedia.

00:11:18 So it's a worldwide mapping project with global coverage.

00:11:23 Anyone can edit or contribute to it.

00:11:26 There is some editorial oversight as well to validate those edits.

00:11:32 But what's cool about OpenStreetMap is that its data license allows you to

00:11:37 pull data from it.

00:11:39 So unlike, say, Google Maps, which is fairly limited in what all it can draw,

00:11:45 you can really pull all of these features from OpenStreetMap.

00:11:48 And if you look, if you just zoom in on one of these cities here.

00:11:51 >> Yeah, let's go to Riverside, yeah.

00:11:53 - Yeah, it was surface streets, rail lines, building footprints, parks, train stations,

00:11:59 often grocery stores, restaurants, public schools.

00:12:02 All this stuff we're interested in from an urban planning perspective.

00:12:06 - Yeah, oh, it's really interesting.

00:12:09 And you can add in additional layers, like cycling maps or transportation maps

00:12:15 or topology maps, topological maps, all sorts of interesting things here.

00:12:20 - Yeah, exactly.

00:12:21 And it really lets you kind of hone in on the specific characteristics of the city

00:12:27 that you're interested in.

00:12:29 And there's a humanitarian layer that you can see, and this has been one of the big uses of OpenStreetMap

00:12:35 now for 15 years or so.

00:12:40 Often when there is a disaster in a less developed country, humanitarian aid organizations will go in

00:12:48 and use OpenStreetMap and contribute to it to create a kind of a digital layer

00:12:53 of the facts on the ground.

00:12:55 So the Haiti earthquake a few years back was a primary example of that, where it helped them understand where urbanization was,

00:13:03 where there were water pumps, toilets, and so forth, the kind of things that people need,

00:13:08 but aren't well mapped, often in these informal settlements.

00:13:12 - Yeah, oh, it's amazing.

00:13:13 We have, you know, I think everyone was amazed when Google Maps came out, right?

00:13:19 Before then we had MapQuest and all those things.

00:13:21 You'd have big little up arrow, up arrow, right arrow to like pull in tiles of the world and you know,

00:13:26 Google Maps and the world view that they had.

00:13:28 What was that product called?

00:13:30 Remember?

00:13:31 Where you could kind of fly, it was like a 3D thing.

00:13:33 You could kind of fly around in the early days but it was the same basic data thing.

00:13:36 Anyway, when that stuff came out, it was like, wow, this stuff is, you can now know about the world.

00:13:40 You can say, where did that road go?

00:13:42 I never went down.

00:13:43 You could just follow it and see or go to street view or whatever.

00:13:46 But a lot of that is locked behind.

00:13:48 however Google wants you to use it, right?

00:13:51 And it's not super accessible.

00:13:53 And so having something like this, where people can contribute, especially if they care about their neighborhood, right?

00:13:58 A lot of this people are contributing back into OpenStreetMap data.

00:14:02 - Yeah, exactly.

00:14:05 Yeah, so the nice thing with this is that it really is much more in that open source,

00:14:09 open data model of the world, which means we can do open science with it,

00:14:13 citizen science with it.

00:14:15 People who just notice that stuff is missing in their own community, you're able to fix it.

00:14:20 It's no longer that frustration of, well, when will Google get this thing right?

00:14:24 Or, hey, we have this new highway that was built outside my town.

00:14:27 When's it gonna show up?

00:14:28 I mean, it's up to you.

00:14:29 You can make it show up later today.

00:14:31 There is a drawback to that though.

00:14:33 The drawback is you get what we call sampling biases.

00:14:36 That is, you tend to see more coverage in places where people tend to contribute more.

00:14:42 And those things tend to be correlated with demographic characteristics.

00:14:46 Men contribute more than women.

00:14:47 higher income places more than lower income places just from a resourcing perspective.

00:14:53 And so one of the challenges we face as researchers using OpenStreetMap data for our analytics work

00:15:00 is keeping those in mind because it's hard to do comparative analysis.

00:15:04 If you don't know it's because the infrastructure is actually different in two places

00:15:08 or because it's been digitized to a different extent in two places.

00:15:11 - Right, right, right.

00:15:12 Just maybe higher fidelity information might skew some analysis one way or another, right?

00:15:18 - That's right, exactly.

00:15:19 And it tends to work pretty well comparatively for stuff like roads, streets,

00:15:24 whereas things like pedestrian footpaths or fresh food markets might be well digitized

00:15:30 in San Francisco and Portland, but probably not, say, in a small town in India

00:15:35 or Indonesia, let alone like a suburb of Des Moines, Iowa.

00:15:38 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:15:40 One of the apps that I use a lot is onX.

00:15:43 You know onX?

00:15:44 - Yeah, onX is cool.

00:15:46 You can, I do a lot of off-road motorcycle riding and it'll show you all the little trails and stuff,

00:15:52 but someone's got to go and enter all that information.

00:15:55 And so some places are super well mapped and others are not on the map at all.

00:16:00 But I imagine they probably get some of their data from OpenStreetMap as well,

00:16:04 although I haven't been able to tell.

00:16:06 - Yeah, it's a good question.

00:16:06 A lot of people downstream do use OpenStreetMap data because of its quality and accessibility.

00:16:13 - Yeah, Mark out in the audience is asking, is there some kind of mobile app that kind of gives you

00:16:18 access to the OpenStreetMap data?

00:16:21 Kind of like Google Maps.

00:16:21 - Yeah, there are some mobile apps for it.

00:16:26 I don't use them.

00:16:27 It has some challenges with routing because it is publicly editable.

00:16:32 Sometimes there'll be little breaks in the connections where it's not digitized quite right.

00:16:37 But there are routing apps.

00:16:38 You could replace, say, Google Maps on your phone with OpenStreetMap and you can route with it.

00:16:42 It works particularly well in big cities and places like Europe and the US,

00:16:47 less so in small rural areas or in less developed countries.

00:16:51 - Yeah, yeah, the onX thing is, it doesn't really route you, but it shows you on a map

00:16:56 and then it shows you where you go on it, and if you choose to stay on the path,

00:16:59 then it'll really help you, but it doesn't really say, you can't say, "Give me directions."

00:17:05 At least not when you're off-road.

00:17:07 If you're on-road, maybe it'll fall back to something that works, but yeah, amazing.

00:17:11 - So what's the licensing story behind all this data?

00:17:14 How, the name probably gives a lot of it away, OpenStreetMap, but how is this data usable?

00:17:19 What can people do with it?

00:17:20 - Yeah, so it's basically usable for non-commercial purposes with attribution.

00:17:26 So for example, as researchers, when we are using these data, we just need to attribute where it came from,

00:17:35 OpenStreetMap and its contributors.

00:17:38 And I ended up including that license information somewhere on the read me for OSMNX,

00:17:45 because I think a lot of time people will look over these underlying data sources and tools

00:17:50 when they're using these kind of downstream, downstream tools and apps.

00:17:56 So because of that, I just wanted to call it, yeah, you can see it on screen here.

00:18:00 So I mentioned OpenStreetMap's open data license requires that derivative works provide proper attribution,

00:18:06 which is really nice 'cause it's a very easy thing to do for the cornucopia of data that they make available.

00:18:11 - Yeah, yeah, that's amazing.

00:18:14 This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by the folks at Posit.

00:18:18 Posit has made a huge investment in the Python community lately.

00:18:21 Known originally for RStudio, they've been building out a suite of tools

00:18:25 and services for Team Python.

00:18:27 Over the past few years, we've all learned some pretty scary terms, of squatting, supply chain attack, obfuscated code, and more. These all orbit around the idea

00:18:38 that when you install Python packages, you're effectively running arbitrary code off the

00:18:43 internet on your dev machine, and usually even on your servers. The thought alone makes me shudder,

00:18:48 and this doesn't even touch the reproducibility issues surrounding external packages.

00:18:53 But there are tools to help. Posit Package Manager can solve both problems for you.

00:18:58 Think of Posit Package Manager as your personal package concierge.

00:19:02 You use it to build your own package repositories within your firewall that keep your project safe.

00:19:07 You can upload your own internal packages to share or import packages directly from PyPI.

00:19:12 Your team members can install from these repos in normal ways using tools like pip, poetry, and uv.

00:19:18 Posit Package Manager can help you manage updates ensuring you're using the latest,

00:19:23 most secure versions of your packages. But it also takes point-in-time snapshots of your

00:19:28 repos, which you can use to rerun your code reproducibly in the future.

00:19:33 Posit Package Manager reports on packages with known CVEs and other vulnerabilities

00:19:38 so you can keep ahead of threats.

00:19:40 And if you need the highest level of security, you can even run Posit Package Manager in

00:19:44 air-gapped environments.

00:19:46 If you work on our data science team where security matters, you owe it to you and your

00:19:50 org to check out Posit Package Manager.

00:19:52 visit talkpython.fm/ppm today and get a three month free trial to see if it's a good fit.

00:19:58 That's talkpython.fm/ppm.

00:20:01 The link is in your podcast player show notes.

00:20:03 Thank you to Posit for supporting the show.

00:20:07 If I wanted to build a commercial product, I wanted to build on X squared or whatever,

00:20:12 where I could have people drive around and use that and map it and make notes and maybe contribute back.

00:20:17 Do you know what the story, I mean, obviously not a lawyer, right?

00:20:20 But what's the, would people be able to do that?

00:20:23 Or is there a paid API or how does it work?

00:20:25 - It's a good question.

00:20:27 So I know in practice people can because I see commercial tools that use OpenStreetMap data all the time.

00:20:32 I don't know the details though because one of the nice things about being in academia

00:20:36 is you end up being so divorced from the commercial world that I don't have to worry about that.

00:20:41 - Yeah, that's pretty good, right?

00:20:44 Just do your research, answer interesting questions and follow the lead, right?

00:20:48 - Those are the benefits, yeah.

00:20:49 It comes with drawbacks, but those are the benefits.

00:20:52 - Yeah, I'm aware of some of the drawbacks as well, for sure.

00:20:55 All right, well, so that is the foundation of this project, OSMNX.

00:21:01 Tell us about your project.

00:21:03 - Yeah, so OSMNX is a Python package that lets you interact with OpenShift's APIs

00:21:10 to make it really easy to download data and build models or a data frame of those data.

00:21:17 So the two main things that it does is it can create a graph model.

00:21:22 So that is a model of a network like streets or rails or highways or anything else.

00:21:30 Or you can create a geo data frame.

00:21:31 That's kind of a spatialized version of a pandas data frame using GeoPandas of OpenStreetMap features.

00:21:38 So that's all the stuff in OpenStreetMap.

00:21:40 It could be points, lines, polygons.

00:21:43 It could be traffic signals or parks or schools or roads.

00:21:48 But you can download either of those and then do whatever it is you wanna do with them.

00:21:53 And OSMNX has some other stuff built in.

00:21:56 So it has a simple routing engine built in, some visualization tools.

00:22:02 You can work with elevation so that you can figure out street grades.

00:22:07 Particularly relevant, for example, if you're a cyclist and you're trying to choose a shortest path

00:22:12 that maybe minimizes those grades and so forth.

00:22:15 - Even for cars, Google started offering a, this path saves, uses the least fuel,

00:22:22 or in my case, the least electricity, whatever you put into it to make it go.

00:22:28 That's also, uses like that would be interesting.

00:22:32 - Yeah, exactly.

00:22:33 I mean, kind of superficially, we always imagine that our shortest path to get somewhere

00:22:37 is the one that minimizes our travel time.

00:22:39 But in reality, there are a lot of other things minimize including fuel consumption or for pedestrians.

00:22:45 Empirically, we know that people will take longer routes if it's a nicer route.

00:22:50 We're not trying to shave off a minute to walk along the arterial road with the aluminum.

00:22:55 >> You go through the fence by that old abandoned factory back here, and you go straight across, it'll be great.

00:23:03 You'll save a minute.

00:23:05 >> Exactly.

00:23:07 >> Amazing. Okay. Yeah, super fun.

00:23:09 As part of those visualizations, Can you draw maps?

00:23:13 You can, yeah. So it has some mapping capabilities.

00:23:17 You can also plot routes on it.

00:23:20 It ties into a folium package, which is a Python package to develop leaflet JavaScript web maps.

00:23:28 So you can do interactive web maps from it.

00:23:31 And then on top of OSMNX, there's a cool downstream package called Pretty Maps that I'm not affiliated with,

00:23:39 but does really nice, aesthetically pleasing mapping.

00:23:44 It's really customizable and really cool.

00:23:46 >> Okay. Do you have a gallery or something?

00:23:48 >> I do. Yeah. So if you scroll up a little bit, there's a link to the examples gallery.

00:23:53 It's on GitHub, OSMNX examples.

00:23:57 >> You can pull up different notebooks?

00:23:59 >> Yeah, exactly. So each notebook covers a different theme of analysis.

00:24:03 It would be commonly done with OSMNX.

00:24:06 >> Oh, nice. Yeah, that's really cool.

00:24:07 People just pull up the notebook and see how it works.

00:24:09 What one do you think is a good representative one to maybe like get a sense of how to work with it?

00:24:13 - So we count from zero 'cause we're in the Python world.

00:24:16 So notebook zero is a good place to start.

00:24:19 That kind of steps through some of the basic functionality that most users would be interested in starting with.

00:24:26 - Sure, okay.

00:24:28 Yeah, so people can download these notebooks in the examples repository, which I'll link to.

00:24:34 - Yeah, exactly.

00:24:34 So there's a getting started guide in the documentation after kind of reading through that,

00:24:40 that examples gallery is a really good way to just kind of get a sense of code

00:24:44 that you can copy and paste to get started.

00:24:46 - Okay, excellent.

00:24:47 And 5,000 GitHub stars, almost a thousand forks.

00:24:51 You know, that's quite a bit of traction.

00:24:52 Congratulations.

00:24:53 - Yeah, thanks.

00:24:54 I mean, it's weird.

00:24:55 This is very much my side hustle, but it's also really been a labor of love

00:25:00 for a long time now.

00:25:02 There is no reward in academia for creating open source packages.

00:25:08 I think if you explain it very carefully to academic power brokers, they say,

00:25:13 "That makes sense, that's great, that's a good contribution." But prima facie, that doesn't mean anything.

00:25:18 They have no idea.

00:25:19 - It's really, it's tough to put it on a 10-year application, right?

00:25:22 - Yeah, it makes it sound like you're wasting your time and you don't understand what you're supposed to be doing

00:25:27 with your time.

00:25:29 (laughing)

00:25:29 - Like, but you understand, the research is so easy now.

00:25:32 - Yeah.

00:25:33 I mean, that's really how that started.

00:25:34 I thought I was gonna be able to do this research without having to create my own tool,

00:25:39 but it turned out I was not able to.

00:25:41 - Interesting, what was your background in programming at that point?

00:25:45 - Yeah, so my undergrad and master's degree, I did computer systems and information systems.

00:25:53 I worked in the private sector for a few years and decided to go back to school

00:25:56 for my PhD in urban planning.

00:25:59 But when I was coming into that, I was pitching myself as this sort of like

00:26:03 data science analytics kind of person in that world, which was starting to get kind of hot at that time.

00:26:09 So it ended up being a nice fit.

00:26:12 And when I started my dissertation, I had this dissertation proposal that was, you know,

00:26:19 very, very nice, this kind of big grand proposal.

00:26:21 I ended up only doing the first chapter of it for my entire dissertation

00:26:25 because of how these things expand to fill space.

00:26:27 And when I pitched my proposal to my dissertation committee, there are a lot of assumptions about the tools

00:26:33 that were out there.

00:26:33 You know, I knew OpenStreetMap was out there.

00:26:35 I'd seen there were some tools to download and work with data from it.

00:26:38 So I was pretty sure we'd be able to create a nice mathematical graph model

00:26:43 of OpenStreetMap data automatically.

00:26:46 As I started on my first week of making that happen, I realized the tool did not exist.

00:26:51 And in fact, it was profoundly difficult to get data from OpenStreetMap.

00:26:56 If you wanted to filter it, like I just want pedestrian paths, not everything.

00:27:01 I just want drivable streets, not everything else.

00:27:04 And so the first year of my dissertation work was creating the first version of OSM and X accordingly.

00:27:11 - So you must have grants and stuff for your research as academics do.

00:27:17 How much time are you allowed to sort of bring some of that into adding features back to this project?

00:27:24 - Yeah, back to the benefits of academia, the nice thing is as long as you get

00:27:29 what they want to see done, as long as those outputs are there, your time is really completely your own, right?

00:27:34 So you teach a couple classes, you have to publish a few papers a year.

00:27:37 Other than that, you're free to do whatever.

00:27:39 So I do get grants, helps me fund my graduate students.

00:27:44 Ironically, it's very hard to get grants to do this kind of open source software,

00:27:49 open commons development.

00:27:52 Everyone talks about it, and especially grant funders know how much we all use this stuff,

00:27:56 and they really like it, but it just doesn't get funded.

00:27:59 So what you have to do is you have to kind of hack it in or sideload it, I guess, into your grants

00:28:06 where the grant will answer this empirical question that's near and dear to the funder's heart.

00:28:10 But to do that, we have this tool building phase for six months, be able to unlock the analytics for it.

00:28:16 And so that's really how a lot of the features and a lot of the modules have been added to OSMNx over time.

00:28:23 There's this new project I ought to do, so we'll just build it into the package.

00:28:27 - Right, we need to be able to answer new questions, so we got to have new ways to get to the data, yeah?

00:28:32 - Yeah, exactly.

00:28:34 And it is poorly incentivized in academia, but academia has really been home

00:28:39 to a lot of open source tool development, especially niche tools, you know,

00:28:44 from stuff like Astropy, for the astronomers and astrophysicists, to things like PySAL,

00:28:51 the Spatial Analysis Library in Python, but a lot of things that academics

00:28:54 have kind of been at the forefront of, But for us, it's always a side hustle.

00:28:58 - Right, stuff with biology, psychology, a lot of the sciences, I imagine.

00:29:02 - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:02 - Working on open source projects like this feels to me very much like the concept

00:29:08 of funding basic science, right?

00:29:11 Not funding, we need to solve this problem so we can create a bomb or new energy or go to space,

00:29:17 but we're just doing it 'cause we need to understand the science better and it'll help us then apply it eventually,

00:29:23 maybe, at some point, right?

00:29:24 Same sort of thing here.

00:29:26 If these exist, it will supercharge the urban planning space to a huge degree, but getting people to fund it

00:29:34 or to care about helping build that up, I imagine it's a little bit frustrating.

00:29:39 - No, that's exactly, I mean, the way I talk about it is it really is a sort of basic science work

00:29:44 that everyone takes for granted as though these things just exist, right?

00:29:49 This tool just exists, we don't know where it comes from, it has an API, that API just exists,

00:29:55 And it really kind of obscures all of these human decisions and social structures and processes and institutions

00:30:03 that make it difficult or make other things easy and really shape what we end up being able to work with.

00:30:09 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:11 Well, someday maybe you can put down, yeah, I only wrote two papers, but I have 10,000 get up stars, so.

00:30:18 - Yeah, well.

00:30:19 - Here's your tenure assignment, you know.

00:30:22 This is the future, I'm there for it.

00:30:26 - It's a race between whether ChatGPT overtakes all of that stuff or you get there and people,

00:30:31 I don't know, that's a whole different deal.

00:30:33 We can talk about that later.

00:30:36 Let's talk about the Overpass API though.

00:30:38 That's the way that you get data from OpenStreetMap.

00:30:43 What is this?

00:30:44 - Yeah, so the Overpass API is another open source tool OpenStreetMaps database and download stuff, basically,

00:30:56 any of OpenStreetMaps features.

00:31:00 So what's nice about Overpass is that there's some public instances that you can just query as a web API.

00:31:07 You can also host it locally if you want to work around throttling limits, rate limits.

00:31:15 Challenge with the Overpass API--

00:31:18 you can see a little bit of it here on screen-- is that the Overpass QL, it's query language,

00:31:23 can be really hard to work with to do complex stuff.

00:31:28 So this is a fairly simple one.

00:31:29 On screen we can see there's a bounding box with some lat long coordinates

00:31:33 to explain where we wanna download data from.

00:31:37 The output will be in JSON format.

00:31:39 The server timeout is 90 seconds.

00:31:42 Big queries can take a long time to run.

00:31:45 And then we're querying here for way elements.

00:31:48 So way would be a line feature in OpenStreetMap.

00:31:53 Any line, it could be street, it could also be the building footprints boundary line.

00:31:59 - I see, the property lines are zoning or whatever, right?

00:32:04 - Yeah, exactly.

00:32:04 Anything represented as a line.

00:32:07 And so we get that back out, it'll be kicked out as a JSON.

00:32:12 And what OSMNx does is it works with this overpass API to try to automate some of these queries.

00:32:18 So rather than having to write the query yourself, download the data, and then convert that raw

00:32:22 OpenStreetMap data into a useful data format, like drop it into Geopandas or into a NetworkX graph,

00:32:29 it assembles all of that under the hood.

00:32:31 It's open source, it's well-documented.

00:32:33 I have a few peer-reviewed articles about the exact process.

00:32:36 So we don't all have to reinvent the wheel trying to work with this data

00:32:39 because none of this is automatic.

00:32:41 And in fact, 10 plus years ago, People were very laboriously having to write

00:32:46 these long scripts.

00:32:47 - You know what I'm gonna do?

00:32:48 I'm gonna get a grad student and it's gonna be their job for the summer to convert this to Excel or MATLAB for me.

00:32:55 Something like that.

00:32:56 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:32:57 Grad students are great.

00:32:59 But what's much greater, I think, is having one or two lines of code to replace your grad student for the summer.

00:33:04 - 100%, let them do meaningful work that they also like, right?

00:33:07 - Yeah, that's the whole--

00:33:08 - Find it out.

00:33:09 Yeah, yeah, that's fantastic.

00:33:10 As I look at this and think about this, It feels to me like OSM and X is a little bit like an ORM is to SQL and databases.

00:33:20 Right?

00:33:20 Like, let's you, you think more in Python language and concepts and don't

00:33:26 worry about the query syntax and the data and all that kind of stuff.

00:33:29 Is that a reasonable analogy?

00:33:31 >> Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

00:33:32 And, and the goal for doing something like that is to try to democratize

00:33:37 doing some of these analyses.

00:33:39 You know, open street map data are really amazing.

00:33:41 Overpass is an amazing resource, but it's really hard to work with unless you have some software development

00:33:48 or database experience.

00:33:50 And a lot of urban planners or urban geographers or urban sociologists do not.

00:33:55 They have great questions, they have great theory, they want a hypothesis test, right?

00:33:59 But we limit science if our tools are too difficult to use or the right data are too hard to access.

00:34:06 - Yeah, back to that basic science ideas, right?

00:34:09 - Yeah.

00:34:10 - Yeah, so for something like this, what OSMNX does is it puts that kind of over patch query

00:34:16 into much more natural language.

00:34:17 Since Python is so readable in the first place, you can just say something like graph from place,

00:34:23 give it a city name, say Pasadena, California.

00:34:27 My network type will be drive, and then just like that, I have that drivable street network model

00:34:34 within the city limits of Pasadena.

00:34:36 - Right, yeah, that sounds entirely more usable.

00:34:39 - And one of the things you said is that it's, it can be pretty expensive to query the Overpass API,

00:34:45 and so your library caches that stuff locally, right?

00:34:48 - That's right, yeah, so expense in the computational sense, all these things are free to use.

00:34:55 - That's what I mean, computationally expensive.

00:34:56 - Yeah, exactly, and there's a lot of time complexity to it as well.

00:35:01 So what we do is we cache everything, which helps you avoid rate limiting.

00:35:05 let's OSMNX be a good neighbor to these free public commons resources that are out there.

00:35:12 - Yeah, interesting.

00:35:13 It sounds almost like you could have a Docker containers for different cities that are preloaded

00:35:19 with all the data that might be interesting to just instantaneously answer a bunch of questions.

00:35:24 - Yeah, which is really my work.

00:35:26 So a lot of what I do will be, I study every street network for every urbanized area in the world, right?

00:35:33 So we'll have like eight to 9,000 of these large urban models.

00:35:38 And so I'll just have things cached locally so that the model building and analytics

00:35:43 are really at the forefront rather than the downloading and querying for a day.

00:35:47 - Right, it's not only lets you be a good citizen and not hammer on OpenStreetMaps API,

00:35:52 but it just lets your stuff work faster.

00:35:54 So the incentives are aligned there, right?

00:35:57 - Yeah, and in fact, a lot of the time when people first use OSMNX, you know, you'll download the, say the model of Los Angeles, California,

00:36:05 and it takes a minute to run the query on their server, download whatever,

00:36:09 a hundred megabytes of data, and then build that graph, theoretic model, do all the spatial stuff to it. but after that,

00:36:18 it's nice and fast the next time that you do it, because you're able to skip all of that pre-processing from the cache.

00:36:23 It probably puts it into some super efficient data structure.

00:36:29 or some others, maybe dictionaries, who knows, right?

00:36:31 - Yeah, yeah, and we use spatial indexes to accelerate all of the spatial queries locally too,

00:36:39 as well.

00:36:40 - Is that built into Geopandas?

00:36:42 - Yeah, built into Geopandas, there is an R tree, which is probably the most common spatial index.

00:36:48 But in addition to that, we also use SciPy's KD tree.

00:36:54 They have like a C implementation of a K dimensional tree that we can do nearest neighbor search.

00:37:00 So for example, Google Maps, you say from my origin to my destination, we can do the same kind of thing.

00:37:04 Say from this point to that point, we'll snap the nearest neighbor on the network

00:37:08 and then solve a path between them.

00:37:10 - Okay, so just the k-nearest neighbor algorithm sort of applied to, what is that,

00:37:15 the vectors of the intersections or something?

00:37:19 Or then you--

00:37:20 - Yeah, so normally when you do origins and destinations, you would snap to a node in the network.

00:37:25 So the nodes would be like the intersections and dead ends.

00:37:28 And then the edges would be the links, the street segments that connect everything together.

00:37:33 And when you solve a path on a graph, it would be from a start node to an end node.

00:37:41 Then you'd minimize it by something, either the fewest hops or the shortest distance

00:37:46 or the shortest travel time.

00:37:47 If you incorporate, say, speed limits, everything else, you can bring in congestion information

00:37:51 to minimize traffic congested travel time or minimize going up and down hills or anything else.

00:37:58 - Excellent.

00:37:58 If I got this data downloaded and I wanted to put it into a proper database,

00:38:04 and by proper I mean one that is its own process, different machines can talk to it in parallel and whatever,

00:38:09 you know, like Postgres or Mongo or something, are there good databases that you would recommend

00:38:14 or that you've tried, like EdgeDB or Neo4j or graph databases the right way to go,

00:38:19 or what do you think?

00:38:20 - It depends on what you're trying to do In terms of OpenStreetMap features,

00:38:25 so if you're just downloading features and you're not worried about, you say those topological relationships between things,

00:38:30 like in a street network, any tabular data structure will do.

00:38:36 Any kind of like SQL database will do just fine.

00:38:39 For a graph model, yeah, you'd want some kind of graph database because they can handle graph algorithms

00:38:46 to do stuff like routing or other kinds of graph analytics like understanding connectivity on the network.

00:38:52 - Yeah, I have this, given this node, tell me all the things that are connected to it.

00:38:56 Like that, those kind of questions could be answered. - Yeah, those kind

00:38:58 of questions, yeah. - Right, yeah.

00:38:59 Yeah, they're kind of pre-computed by the indices in the structures.

00:39:03 What about bringing in other data?

00:39:06 You know, what if I have real estate data that doesn't come from OpenStreetMap,

00:39:10 but I want to pull that in and overlay it with, say, zoning information,

00:39:15 overlapped with census data that gives me revenue, you know, how much that person in that area

00:39:21 makes per year on average or something like that.

00:39:23 Can you answer questions like that?

00:39:25 - Yeah, really common use case.

00:39:26 So OSMNX can kind of do that by itself, but mostly as a tool in the toolkit to do it.

00:39:32 So, you know, a common way that we often will do this is for accessibility analyses.

00:39:37 So for example, here at my house, how many grocery stores could I access

00:39:42 within a 15 minute walk?

00:39:44 And it gives you a sense of, you know, how car dependent or not a place is.

00:39:48 And also we can start looking at food deserts communities where people don't have access to fresh food.

00:39:53 So for that, what you're doing is you have a model of the network, and then you also

00:39:57 have all of this point of interest data, right?

00:39:59 So where all these amenities are located, you would then snap them, load them onto

00:40:04 the graph, and then you can calculate accessibility by looking at where those

00:40:08 things are located.

00:40:09 And you can either look at cumulative opportunities within some time horizon or

00:40:14 distance to the nearest opportunity.

00:40:16 You can put different decays on it, like the utility of it being so far away, drops

00:40:21 the linear decay the further I have to go or a non-linear decay if it really drops off fast.

00:40:26 But it's exactly that.

00:40:27 - Yeah, if a grocery store is three miles away, it's not one third as useful as one that's one mile away.

00:40:32 It's a little bit more to carry your groceries that far.

00:40:35 - And similarly, there's marginal utility for the 30th grocery store that you can reach.

00:40:40 Doesn't give you that much benefit over the 29th that you can reach.

00:40:43 Whereas the first and second are very valuable.

00:40:46 - Yeah, if it goes from zero to one and one to two, those are big jumps right there.

00:40:50 - Yep.

00:40:50 - Okay, very interesting.

00:40:52 How about some projects that people might be thinking about?

00:40:57 They look at this data and they're like, "Wow, this looks really detailed and neat,

00:41:00 "and we have all these different aspects we can ask about," but maybe they just wanna play around.

00:41:06 - Yeah, I mean, hopefully, if you look at the Getting Started Guide or these usage examples,

00:41:11 you'll see it's really easy to play around, two, three lines of code, and you have a visualization of your local street network.

00:41:18 things that we've done in my lab at USC that may spark some interest. We look at

00:41:24 air pollution exposure and driving patterns in Los Angeles to try to understand you know who's driving and where and then in turn who is exposed to

00:41:33 that tailpipe, those tailpipe emissions from those cars. So we use OSM and X to

00:41:39 model those street networks to simulate those trips and to look at what census

00:41:44 tracks that stuff goes through. We also use it for studies of urban form. So that is kind

00:41:50 of the shape, texture, density, the grain of a city. I have this series of square mile

00:41:57 visualizations of different cities around the world. And you can really quickly see

00:42:01 how different forms of urbanism look relative to each other. So a place like Irvine, California,

00:42:10 in Southern California has this really coarse-grained street network.

00:42:15 A place like Venice in Italy has incredibly fine-grained, like spiderweb street network.

00:42:22 Stuff like that really helps to kind of convey these different modes of urbanism and urbanization.

00:42:28 We also use these to look at disaster resilience.

00:42:32 That is, different street networks will be better if things start going wrong around

00:42:37 Things with more redundancy, more connectivity built in are easier to route around if parts start failing

00:42:43 in a fire, in an earthquake.

00:42:45 And so we can capture some of these characteristics and then make recommendations to planners and policy makers

00:42:50 about how to make your street network, how to intervene in it to make it more resilient.

00:42:54 - Yeah, in my area, there's an East-West highway, one of them, very few, that goes from the city west.

00:43:01 It has to go through this mountain tunnel and it's two lanes each way in the mountain,

00:43:05 or three lanes in the mountain tunnel.

00:43:06 and there's even on a Saturday afternoon, there's stopped cars trying to go through that tunnel.

00:43:12 And those are on good days.

00:43:13 Imagine if there was an emergency, it would just be done.

00:43:16 - Yeah, that's the 26, right?

00:43:18 - Exactly, it is the 26.

00:43:20 - Yeah, I used to live in Portland.

00:43:22 I lived in Goose Hollow, and my gym was in Beaverton, so I would have to go through that tunnel to go work out.

00:43:30 It would always be like, you know, one of these days, one of these days.

00:43:35 - Exactly, yeah, I live about a mile from Goose Hollow up through that tunnel.

00:43:39 So yeah. - Oh, cool.

00:43:40 - Yeah, yeah, very cool.

00:43:41 Yeah, but there's just, and that one's hard to fix because there's houses all along there.

00:43:45 It's a big hill, hard to go over it.

00:43:48 You know, it would take a lot of willpower to make another tunnel.

00:43:51 - Yeah, interesting thing.

00:43:52 I did my PhD at Berkeley, and there is another tunnel there that goes from that kind of inner East Bay,

00:43:59 Berkeley, Oakland border, out to the further East suburbs like Orinda, Moraga, and so forth.

00:44:05 And that tunnel is really old.

00:44:07 I mean, it's, I don't know, 80 years old, maybe something like that.

00:44:10 And they determined that when the big one does eventually hit, it will fail, it will collapse.

00:44:16 And it's not, it's cost prohibitive to actually prevent that from happening.

00:44:20 So the idea is it will collapse and crush everyone in that tunnel, and they will then build a new tunnel

00:44:26 at that point when they have to.

00:44:27 - Oh my goodness.

00:44:28 - We have a lot of that to look forward to.

00:44:29 (laughing)

00:44:31 - Yeah, just go quickly when you're in the tunnel.

00:44:33 Get out of there.

00:44:34 >> I always did.

00:44:35 >> Amazing.

00:44:38 All right.

00:44:39 Let's talk real quickly about integrating OpenOSMNX with other data science tooling,

00:44:47 right?

00:44:47 We have so many different things.

00:44:48 We have PyTorch, we have Pandas, we have Polluters, all the different things.

00:44:54 Like what are the different integration features?

00:44:56 You know, you talked about data frames.

00:44:57 That sounds like Pandas and GeoPandas, right?

00:45:01 That's one sort of path across those things.

00:45:03 - Yeah, so OSMNX is built primarily on top of three things.

00:45:10 It's NetworkX for the graph models, Geopandas for the spatial data frames,

00:45:17 and Matplotlib for the visualizations.

00:45:21 In the spatial Python world, most stuff happens in the pandas ecosystem because Geopandas and PySAL and similar tools

00:45:31 are very pandas-oriented.

00:45:34 I know there's been some work toward geopolars, but it's kind of in its infancy,

00:45:39 as far as I know, to this extent.

00:45:41 But that'll be great when that's available.

00:45:44 NetworkX is another funny one because it's a pure Python implementation.

00:45:49 It has a lot of loops, and so it can go really slow for calculating some of these big time complexity graph algorithms,

00:45:56 things like betweenness centrality, where you have this massive OD native,

00:46:01 basically all the nodes to all the nodes.

00:46:03 - Yeah, yeah, some combinatorial craziness.

00:46:06 - It ends up being very time consuming to calculate those kinds of things

00:46:10 for a metro area sized network model.

00:46:14 So we'll integrate with other tools.

00:46:17 iGraph does that in C.

00:46:20 Also using tools like QGraph where you can do it on the GPU instead can be really fun. - Oh wow, okay, yeah.

00:46:27 - But it's limited because of the weighting scheme that you say, I want to minimize travel time

00:46:34 or stuff like that.

00:46:35 - I see.

00:46:37 - Yeah, and then also integrated with Folium to create interactive leaflet web maps out of the box.

00:46:46 - Yeah, I wonder how that the free-threaded Python stuff will affect some of those computational things.

00:46:52 Like that everything compared with everything else sounds like a so-called embarrassingly parallel

00:46:58 sort of problem, right?

00:46:59 And so, you have 10 cores, so let's just do 10 blocks of them all in parallel and you know.

00:47:06 - Yeah, so that's what we do when we do it in pure Python.

00:47:09 So we'll use multi-processing generally with all your CPUs.

00:47:14 The only challenge is that your OD matrix, your origin destination matrix is growing

00:47:20 at this exponential rate, but then there's a linear number of cores, so going from one to 24,

00:47:25 you're dividing by a factor of 24.

00:47:27 But when you have say a million nodes times a million nodes in your graph,

00:47:32 it's going to take a long time.

00:47:34 - It's still gonna be slow, but it's--

00:47:36 - You've got from months down to weeks.

00:47:39 - Yeah, I mean, you're still dividing it by the number of cores, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's super fast.

00:47:45 Although the GPU stuff seems like it could absolutely fly, right?

00:47:48 - Yeah, that makes a big difference.

00:47:50 And I think that's really the area of growth where the handling, I mean, basically getting out

00:47:55 of Python loops in the first place is the biggest area of growth.

00:47:59 And then doing things on a, since these are really just very simple linear algebra problems,

00:48:04 being able to do them on a GPU makes it much more efficient.

00:48:07 - Yeah, did you hear about this thing, this new NVIDIA, what, I don't know what it's called,

00:48:12 Project Digits, where they announced a $3,000 desktop AI computer?

00:48:18 I mean, they call it AI, but really it's just a GPU.

00:48:20 - That is, no, I hadn't heard about that.

00:48:22 - And this thing, it's the size of a Mac mini.

00:48:25 It's this, if you look at the pictures, a little bit of a golden thing.

00:48:28 It's kind of clever they made it gold, but that's a massive computer sitting next to you.

00:48:35 - Yeah.

00:48:36 - You could run that.

00:48:36 This is pretty interesting actually, I think.

00:48:39 - Yeah, yeah, that is.

00:48:42 I mean, it's shocking too, because it looks so much smaller than just an Nvidia card in your desktop.

00:48:49 - I think it basically is just the GPU.

00:48:52 - Right.

00:48:52 - Nothing to do with graphics.

00:48:53 just remote into it over, I don't know, a terminal or however you, or maybe you set

00:48:58 it as the Docker host and then you just do Docker locally, but it runs there, you know,

00:49:02 that type of thing.

00:49:03 I don't know how it works, but I kind of want one.

00:49:05 >> Yeah.

00:49:07 I mean, it looks sexy enough.

00:49:08 Of course you would want one, right?

00:49:09 >> Of course.

00:49:10 But if you had questions like that, if you say I have a million nodes and I could run

00:49:13 that on a GPU, getting something like this that's, you know, kind of the H100 style of

00:49:18 like the really large just meant for compute, not really a graphics card.

00:49:23 like that would really unlock some interesting options.

00:49:25 Yeah, totally.

00:49:26 I mean, yeah.

00:49:27 So I have a, a GeForce card in my desktop that I'll pass them and that stuff locally onto.

00:49:33 But, another one of the academic benefits at USC, we have a high performance computing cluster that, I can schedule tasks to run on that,

00:49:43 say over winter break and then come back in January and, and the month of, of, 1000 CPUs is all done.

00:49:51 That's amazing.

00:49:52 And we had a mainframe, a silicon graphics mainframe when I was studying math that we could all work on

00:50:00 in this group of maybe 10 of us.

00:50:02 And it wasn't as big as what you're saying, but it was a quite expensive, big machine.

00:50:07 It had its own room and it was really allowed to go into that room.

00:50:10 And I remember we came in to, I came in to do whatever I was working on as a grad student or whatever, I think I was a senior.

00:50:17 Anyway, I came in to work on my project and nobody could access it.

00:50:21 and it was still in there making loud noises like it was running, but it acted like it wasn't running.

00:50:25 And so I'm like, what is going on?

00:50:27 One of the other grad students had run a job like you're talking about, but they were having trouble getting into work

00:50:32 'cause they were math people, not programmers.

00:50:34 And they started logging everything.

00:50:36 And there were no limits on what people could do to the computer, the people that set it up.

00:50:41 And so what had happened is it ran 100% CPU on all the cores all night logging

00:50:46 until it ran out of space.

00:50:47 And then apparently the computer won't run anymore if it has zero more bytes.

00:50:50 needed some temp file or something.

00:50:52 And so it just, it was just done.

00:50:55 I imagine you guys have more guardrails than that.

00:50:59 - Yeah, a lot of guardrails.

00:51:00 I would love to try to do something like that just for the yuck sometime, but we got a lot of-

00:51:06 - The admins of that computer would not please with that grad student.

00:51:10 - I can only imagine.

00:51:12 - It took a long time to get it going.

00:51:14 It's like a day of work to get it turned back on.

00:51:16 'Cause they didn't even know what was wrong with it at first it just wouldn't turn on.

00:51:19 - Oh well, jumping back a moment to the, no, that's not the one I wanted to copy,

00:51:25 to the integration, have you considered working with narwhals?

00:51:30 - I looked into narwhals recently.

00:51:32 My understanding is one of the things that does well is it kind of abstracts away from pandas versus polars,

00:51:38 so you're less tool dependent, right?

00:51:40 - Yeah, and it also lets people who want to consume your library, who want to do their work in polars,

00:51:46 talk polars to your project, and people want to do pandas, talk pandas, as well as QDF, modem, pyro, and other.

00:51:53 It kind of is an adapting layer, so people can work in their native framework

00:51:58 and then talk to you.

00:51:59 - Yeah, I mean, yeah, on paper it sounds great.

00:52:02 I haven't played with it yet, other than just being familiar with it, but I mean, that sounds like the ideal, right?

00:52:07 We shouldn't be enforcing these certain APIs or languages on people.

00:52:11 - Yeah, it does look interesting.

00:52:12 I believe its foundational internals are maybe just the API, But there are pollers, not pandas,

00:52:19 so maybe that's not as good of a fit.

00:52:20 But it could be an interesting thing to look in the future to make it native to

00:52:25 all the different DataFrame libraries that people want to talk in.

00:52:28 >> Yeah, definitely.

00:52:30 >> Are you going to need a new grant?

00:52:31 >> Yeah. Here's the basic science stuff.

00:52:34 If I'm interested in network models, I don't know about getting into the nuts and bolts of

00:52:39 which DataFrame API we're going to have people use.

00:52:43 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:52:47 All right, well, let's close this whole conversation out by talking about something that I know

00:52:53 is on a lot of people's minds, and that's LLMs.

00:52:56 And what do LLMs mean for this mapping data and the types of questions you can answer

00:53:02 in OSMNx, all these types of things?

00:53:05 Like, how's that shaping your world?

00:53:08 - Yeah, so two ways that I like to think about it.

00:53:11 One is what LLMs have to offer us today.

00:53:14 And then one is what LLMs have to offer us, say five to 10 years from now.

00:53:18 That is, how do we future-proof ourselves, our careers, our livelihoods?

00:53:23 And I mean, or just optimistically, how do we really get ahead of it to take advantage

00:53:28 of nice things that they'll have to offer?

00:53:30 Today, I am deeply unimpressed with most of the use cases that I see for it.

00:53:36 I think that the outputs only look good to people who aren't experts and don't know how wrong it is.

00:53:42 Does some things well, you know, like having a co-pilot while you're coding

00:53:45 and having it recommending.

00:53:47 That's nice.

00:53:47 I mean, it's like tab complete from years ago.

00:53:49 It's the same kind of thing, just iterating.

00:53:52 But you know, when someone tells it to, you know, here's the prompt, generate my algorithm for me.

00:53:58 Two things.

00:53:59 One, it very often doesn't do that good of a job even at this point.

00:54:02 And number two, if you don't enjoy doing that kind of thing, I'm not sure why you're in software development

00:54:09 in the first place.

00:54:10 - I know.

00:54:10 - For me, when I interface with it, it's usually in the classroom.

00:54:14 And you'll have, so, you know, people like to complain kids these days.

00:54:17 It's the same way it was when I was in school.

00:54:19 You know, a third of the class loves a subject.

00:54:22 They're just killing it.

00:54:23 They wanna be there.

00:54:24 They want a job in this.

00:54:25 A third of the class, they're like, "Well, it's a required class.

00:54:28 "I'll try to do what I can." And a third of them say, "I don't know why I'm here.

00:54:31 "Why is this a required course?

00:54:33 "I hate this.

00:54:34 "Is there any way I can cheat "to just get a passing grade?" - Where's my shortcut?

00:54:38 - Exactly.

00:54:39 I mean, and you know, the difference today is that LLMs make it so much easier

00:54:44 and they really normalized cheating as well, where we don't have that good of systems in place

00:54:50 to be able to detect it for code, for writing, for anything.

00:54:55 And I think one of the problems here, you know, it goes back to like licensing or attribution.

00:55:01 When we normalize this kind of cheating, we're normalizing taking credit

00:55:05 for things that aren't our work.

00:55:07 And if we're doing that in school, we build those habits, what's it gonna look like

00:55:10 when we're working in the workforce?

00:55:12 We either don't have the skills that people think we have, or we think it's just normal, acceptable practice

00:55:18 to copy and paste and say, here's my intellectual contribution.

00:55:22 - It's too much of a crutch, and if maybe it solves 90% of the problems,

00:55:26 but that 10%, it doesn't, you're fully incapable of approaching that problem, right?

00:55:31 - Exactly, yeah.

00:55:32 And I think, so that's the first part, what LLM's offered us today.

00:55:35 I think the second part is say five to 10 years from now.

00:55:39 Part of it is scary and part of it is exciting.

00:55:41 I think that coding as it looks today is going to largely go away over my lifetime

00:55:48 because coding is this mix of art and intellectual labor and manual labor.

00:55:54 The manual labor parts will be going away and that's where a lot of people use LLMs now

00:55:59 to reduce some of that grind of coding.

00:56:02 And I think it's important for us to figure out where those intellectual contributions are,

00:56:07 where the art, the poetry of coding remains a human contribution moving forward,

00:56:13 where we have that sort of human in the loop to make ethical decisions that we don't pass off,

00:56:19 where it is humans who are doing some of the architecting and not just handing it off saying,

00:56:23 "Here's a prompt, now redesign our financial system from the ground up for us,"

00:56:27 but that it remains human guardrails and human ethics and human notions of justice that we use AI to help us,

00:56:37 but doesn't replace that.

00:56:38 - Yeah, I feel like there's gonna be a lot of people who are programmers now are gonna have to kind of be

00:56:43 a senior tech team lead type of thing, where the team is asking the LLM to do stuff for you.

00:56:50 And that's gonna be awesome for those people, us, but for the people who are brand new,

00:56:55 there's gonna be a wider gap to try to cross.

00:56:58 It's gonna be harder and harder to go from real beginner to that level when, who's going to employ you

00:57:04 when it takes you a day and I can ask the LLM to do it in five minutes and I got to review it either way.

00:57:09 That's a very concerning social consequence, I think.

00:57:13 - No, exactly.

00:57:13 I think those kind of entry-level jobs are very much more labor-focused, right?

00:57:20 The senior dev isn't doing that work because someone with less experience, less pay can do it.

00:57:27 And if LLMs replace that over time, It's really hard to get your foot in the door in that industry.

00:57:31 - Yeah, it can be like COBOL programmers did not a program without an LLM someday.

00:57:35 (laughing)

00:57:36 - Yeah.

00:57:37 (laughing)

00:57:38 - I don't know if that's good or bad, but it's gonna be weird.

00:57:40 Anyway, I think it's probably pretty interesting.

00:57:44 And given, you know, access with your API and with all this data, I'm sure people will be able to ask

00:57:49 and answer interesting questions with it.

00:57:51 - That's the hope.

00:57:52 - Indeed, all right.

00:57:53 Two really quick things to close out our conversation.

00:57:55 Roadmap, anything on the roadmap coming real soon that people have been asking about, thinking about?

00:58:01 - Yeah, so I just released V 2.0, I don't know, a month or so ago.

00:58:08 And so, thank you.

00:58:09 And that was really just a year of rethinking the API.

00:58:14 I was gonna allow myself breaking changes, really cleaning things up.

00:58:17 I added type annotations for the first time.

00:58:19 I really changed the linting and formatting, CI, pre-commit, everything.

00:58:24 So it's a much more rigorous package at this point.

00:58:28 I'm taking a breather right now, where I don't have that much big on the horizon.

00:58:34 I try to keep a really clean issue board as well, where I quickly triage, this is in scope, this is not.

00:58:40 - Yeah, I noticed you have three open issues and zero PRs, which is awesome.

00:58:43 - Yeah, I try to do it courteously, where I'll tell people a lot of the time,

00:58:47 you know, this isn't in scope for the project, but I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm busy,

00:58:51 so keeping a clean issue board makes my life simple.

00:58:53 So short answer, I'm taking a breather instead of road mapping in January.

00:58:59 - But you just had a big release, which is cool.

00:59:01 - Yeah.

00:59:01 - Yeah.

00:59:02 Contributions accepted?

00:59:04 - Absolutely.

00:59:04 And very often what I ask when someone opens an issue and I say, "Yeah, that does sound useful,

00:59:10 would you like to open a PR?" And as much as this is my side hustle, most of the pull requests that I add to it

00:59:19 are very much aligned with a current or recent research project that I'm working on.

00:59:24 So for others, if you see a gap or a cool feature that could make people's lives easier,

00:59:30 better analytics down the road, please propose it and I'd love a contribution.

00:59:34 - Excellent.

00:59:34 All right, final call to action.

00:59:35 People are psyched about mapping.

00:59:38 They wanna get started.

00:59:38 What do you tell 'em?

00:59:40 - I tell them to work through existing examples from the tools that are out there.

00:59:45 If you haven't done any kind of mapping before, there's a lot of cool packages in R and in Python.

00:59:51 Find something you're comfortable with.

00:59:53 work through some tutorials, and then figure out something close to home.

00:59:56 It's so much easier if you have that kind of local motivation, local knowledge.

01:00:01 Do some mapping, do an analysis in your community for something that's bothering you,

01:00:04 you know, you think could be better.

01:00:06 - Excellent.

01:00:07 All right, well, thank you for being here and congrats on that cool project.

01:00:10 - Thank you very much.
