00:00:00 Talk Python To Me, episode number zero, recorded Saturday, March 21st, 2015.

00:00:06 Hello, and welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python.

00:00:36 The language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:39 This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:00:41 Follow me on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy, and keep up with the show and listen to past

00:00:47 episodes at talkpythontome.com.

00:00:50 This very short episode is just a small deposit to get this podcast started.

00:00:54 I looked around and I saw that there was really no good Python podcasts anymore.

00:01:00 There used to be, but for some reason they all stopped.

00:01:03 So I decided it's time to take some action and create a podcast for everybody out there

00:01:08 in the Python community.

00:01:08 So I hope you all enjoy it, and I hope you let me know what you think of the show by contacting

00:01:13 me.

00:01:14 First, though, I want to let you know we have some fantastic episodes and some brilliant

00:01:18 guests lined up for the very first set of shows.

00:01:21 One of the first guests is going to be Mike Bayer, who is the creator and maintainer of SQL

00:01:27 Alchemy.

00:01:27 SQLAlchemy is a really fantastic ORM that lets you talk to all sorts of relational databases.

00:01:33 On the other side, maybe we want to talk about NoSQL and non-relational databases.

00:01:39 So we're going to have Jesse Davis from MongoDB on our show as well.

00:01:44 And Jesse is the maintainer and the author of PyMongo, the PyMongo driver, as well as a ton

00:01:50 of other amazing Python open source projects.

00:01:53 So we're going to talk to Jesse about Python, about MongoDB, maybe even some asyncio.

00:01:59 We're also going to talk about web services.

00:02:02 We're going to focus on EVE, which is an open source REST API.

00:02:06 And we're going to talk to Nikola Hiroshi about EVE.

00:02:09 Should be a fascinating conversation.

00:02:11 Well, I hope you're looking forward to these conversations as much as I am.

00:02:15 Now, before you go, I hope you'll go over to talkpythontome.com and click on friends of

00:03:02 Stating with my voice.

00:03:03 There's no norm that I can feel within.

00:03:05 Haven't been sleeping.

00:03:06 I've been using lots of rest.

00:03:08 I'll pass the mic back to who rocked his best.

00:03:11 I'm first a ballot first.

00:03:21 developers, developers, developers, developers.
