00:00:00 ORMs are one of the main tools to put first-class data access in the hands of non-SQL-loving

00:00:05 developers.

00:00:06 And even for those who do love SQL, making them way more productive.

00:00:10 When you hear about ORMs in Python, we often hear about either SQLAlchemy or Django ORM.

00:00:15 And we should, they're great.

00:00:17 But there are newer ORMs that take better advantage of modern Python.

00:00:20 On this episode, you'll meet Daniel Townsend.

00:00:23 He's the creator of Piccolo ORM.

00:00:25 A great ORM that is async first, but also has a synchronous API.

00:00:30 It has a super clean query syntax, and it's easy to learn.

00:00:33 This is Talk Python to Me, episode 328, recorded July 22nd, 2021.

00:01:54 Dan, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:55 Yeah, thanks for having me.

00:01:56 I'm a big fan of the show, so it's kind of like a little dream to be on the show.

00:01:59 Oh, how nice.

00:02:00 That means a lot.

00:02:01 Thank you.

00:02:01 It's great to have you here, and you've built some really neat software that I'm looking forward

00:02:06 to diving into.

00:02:07 It's interesting because we're going to talk about your ORM, but it's also, there's so many

00:02:12 different areas at which now they're kind of past Python 2, and there's a lot of folks

00:02:16 who are saying, you know what, we can really put Python 2 behind us, and let's just build

00:02:20 for the future.

00:02:21 That just opens up so many doors, right?

00:02:23 Like, oh, well, type-ins, of course, type-ins.

00:02:25 Why not type-ins?

00:02:25 Well, Python 2 is why not type-ins, but not anymore, right?

00:02:29 And async and all these other things, and just, it's really great to have these frameworks

00:02:35 like yours coming along that just go, modern Python, what can we build now?

00:02:39 Yeah, I totally agree.

00:02:40 It felt like Python 3.6 kind of closed the door on the, should we still be using Python

00:02:44 2 conversation?

00:02:45 Because by that point, you had async, you had type annotations, data classes, I think

00:02:50 were Python 3.7, enums.

00:02:52 It just goes on and on.

00:02:53 Like, it just felt like the Python community knocked out of the park, Python 3.6 and on.

00:02:58 Yeah, I have a theory that is completely unsubstantiated, that actually a lot of the progress has to

00:03:05 do with f-strings.

00:03:06 So many people are like, ah, I just want to easily format this code.

00:03:09 What do I need?

00:03:10 I need Python 3.6.

00:03:11 Fine.

00:03:11 That's true, actually.

00:03:12 We're going to switch.

00:03:13 And it's such a minor feature.

00:03:15 Still minor.

00:03:16 The pain of going back would be horrible.

00:03:18 I couldn't imagine using Python 2 now, actually.

00:03:20 I know.

00:03:21 Yeah.

00:03:21 Same.

00:03:22 Quick welcome to some folks on Livestream.

00:03:24 Chris May.

00:03:24 Hey.

00:03:24 Happy to see you here.

00:03:25 Paul Everett.

00:03:26 So glad you can stop by.

00:03:27 And Teddy as well.

00:03:28 We'll get some questions in from you all, I'm sure.

00:03:30 Now, before we get into Piccolo and all the cool stuff that I was alluding to there, let's

00:03:36 just start with your story, Dan.

00:03:37 How do you get into programming in Python?

00:03:38 Yeah, so I've been programming for quite a long time now.

00:03:40 I might look quite youthful on this camera, but that's just because my webcam's got a filter

00:03:44 on it.

00:03:44 But I've actually been through.

00:03:46 The touch up my appearance is checked.

00:03:47 Yeah.

00:03:48 I've actually been.

00:03:48 I'm just kidding.

00:03:49 Yeah.

00:03:49 Programming with Python for about 14 years.

00:03:52 So Django was kind of one of my first frameworks and just really fell in love with it because

00:03:57 in university I learned C. And then it's like, oh, this world of Python exists and it's

00:04:01 a bit more easier than C. And so I've used it extensively since then.

00:04:05 I've mostly been working for startups and design agencies and then really fell down the

00:04:11 async rabbit hole over the last few years.

00:04:14 So I really enjoy working with WebSockets and building kind of interactive front ends and

00:04:20 also really kind of excited the way that Postgres continues to grow and have new features.

00:04:25 They're the things that really excite me in the Python world.

00:04:27 Yeah.

00:04:27 Those things are super exciting and the web frameworks are coming along to embrace them.

00:04:32 The language features, you know, async and await.

00:04:35 We had asyncio in Python 3.4, but it didn't really gain a ton of adoption because there

00:04:40 was, it sort of had this callback style of working, which is not the same as, you know,

00:04:45 await a thing and just keep rocking.

00:04:46 Totally agree.

00:04:47 Yeah.

00:04:47 So I think they pretty much took what Twisted had created and ported it over.

00:04:51 And like I say, it's all callbacks and it was still better than, it was still good

00:04:55 to have that option in the standard library.

00:04:57 But I totally agree.

00:04:57 Async await really kind of set it on fire because it was quite hard to approach asyncio at

00:05:02 first.

00:05:02 It was, you don't have to think about how you write code differently.

00:05:05 You just put the awaits in the spots and then, you know, everything kind of flows.

00:05:08 It's, I know it's not the same, but from how you think about structuring your code is real

00:05:13 similar.

00:05:14 Yeah.

00:05:14 And I think the maturity is there now with the libraries and the standard library and it

00:05:18 feels like you can just dive in and it feels a bit like a no brainer now to use async.

00:05:22 Yeah.

00:05:22 I think it is a no brainer for sure.

00:05:24 So it's interesting that you got into Django in the early days because Django is the only

00:05:31 major web framework that says, here's your ORM.

00:05:34 Here's how you use it.

00:05:35 As opposed to Flask that says, do what you want.

00:05:38 Or Pyramid that says, do what you want.

00:05:40 You know, you could use an ORM, but you don't have to.

00:05:42 But Django is, it's part of the culture and the zen of it.

00:05:45 Right?

00:05:46 Yeah, I'm a big fan of Django.

00:05:47 I think it's kind of a masterpiece because it stood the test of time so remarkably well

00:05:52 and how you could have written a app 12 years ago and then in an afternoon, you could have

00:05:58 upgraded it to the latest version.

00:05:59 So there's a lot to be said for Django and I really like the tight integration.

00:06:03 So people tend to prefer one or the other, the kind of the Flask route where you can make

00:06:08 all of your choices.

00:06:09 But I like really tightly integrated solutions where you come to a problem and then you pretty

00:06:16 much know what to pick.

00:06:17 Yeah.

00:06:18 So that's definitely inspired Piccolo to some extent.

00:06:20 Yeah.

00:06:21 I love the diversity of technology and libraries and ways of doing things in the Python space.

00:06:26 But when people come from other technologies, it's a challenge to go, well, here's 20 different

00:06:33 ORMs you could use and seven different web frameworks.

00:06:35 And they're like, I don't want seven.

00:06:36 I want to know what I should be doing.

00:06:38 What should I do?

00:06:39 Right.

00:06:39 And so it's a mixed bag.

00:06:41 I really like that.

00:06:42 But the thing is, if you come from the JavaScript world, then it's a relief because you've only

00:06:45 got 20, not 2000.

00:06:46 Oh my goodness.

00:06:48 This one's seven months old.

00:06:50 It's like ancient.

00:06:50 Can we still use it?

00:06:51 Yeah.

00:06:52 Yeah.

00:06:53 No, no.

00:06:53 That's a whole different discussion.

00:06:55 The JavaScript churn over there.

00:06:57 Yeah.

00:06:57 But yeah, let's focus in on what you built here.

00:07:00 So let's talk about Piccolo.

00:07:01 You just sell it.

00:07:02 You describe it as a fast async ORM for Python.

00:07:06 That's easy to learn.

00:07:07 And I think it seems like it really hits on all those points.

00:07:10 Tell us about it.

00:07:10 Yes.

00:07:11 So all those terms are like fairly aspirational.

00:07:13 So the fast is because it's built on async PG.

00:07:16 So this is a really fast Postgres adapter that the Magic Stack guys built.

00:07:20 Part of the reason it's so fast is it's written in Syphon.

00:07:23 So it's compiled.

00:07:24 And then there's also a few other features in Piccolo, which kind of help it speed wise, like

00:07:28 frozen queries where it doesn't have to generate the SQL each time.

00:07:32 It kind of caches some of it.

00:07:33 So that's kind of where the fast comes from.

00:07:35 Async.

00:07:36 Oh, nice.

00:07:37 Async.

00:07:37 Async.

00:07:38 Async.

00:07:38 Async.io.

00:07:38 That was really one of the core reasons for building it is because I was a Django channels

00:07:43 power user and I had to build a lot of chat applications in my day job.

00:07:47 So for me, async was kind of essential.

00:07:49 And then the easy to learn is called also aspirational.

00:07:52 I put like as much effort as I possibly can into the documentation and stuff like that.

00:07:56 But I'll let the readers be the judge of that.

00:07:59 Yeah.

00:07:59 That's in the eye of the beholder.

00:08:00 Right.

00:08:00 But at the same time, you have done a lot of things that I don't see others doing.

00:08:05 Like the documentation is good.

00:08:06 Obviously, that's pretty standard on a lot of the different frameworks, although they can

00:08:11 be super intense.

00:08:12 Right.

00:08:12 Like I love SQLAlchemy.

00:08:13 But when I go and read there, I'm like, OK, here's a 20 page doc.

00:08:16 I better pay attention and turn off my music and just like not miss something on the other

00:08:21 hand.

00:08:21 But what you are doing that's pretty unique is you've got like a playground.

00:08:24 You've got a playground for the admin backend.

00:08:26 Oh, by the way, there's an admin backend.

00:08:27 And you've got a playground for trying out queries and stuff like that.

00:08:32 Right.

00:08:32 That's pretty unique.

00:08:33 Yeah.

00:08:33 So I was really excited by the playground concept.

00:08:36 So it's something I borrowed from the Swift world.

00:08:38 And because Apple are trying to make Swift accessible to newcomers, they have this concept

00:08:43 of a playground, which is basically a pre-populated chunk of code.

00:08:47 And then you can just play around with it as kind of the name implies.

00:08:51 So I use IPython to achieve it.

00:08:53 So a lot of people know IPython, just running it on the command line like a terminal.

00:08:57 But you can actually embed it within your Python code.

00:09:00 So the way the playgrounds work is it creates a SQLite database.

00:09:04 It loads an example schema, populates it with data, and then basically launches the IPython

00:09:10 shell.

00:09:11 So you basically have all of that set up.

00:09:13 Because one of the problems with learning an ORM is the barrier is huge when you think

00:09:17 about it for a newcomer.

00:09:18 You have to set up a database.

00:09:21 You have to understand schemas and migrations and running them and populating data.

00:09:26 So I just wanted to say, look, I'm going to shortcut all of that.

00:09:28 You install Piccolo.

00:09:29 You do Piccolo Playground Run.

00:09:31 And then you've got an example schema.

00:09:33 And then you can actually follow along with the documentation.

00:09:35 So whenever there's an example query in the Piccolo docs, you can actually run it in the

00:09:40 playground.

00:09:40 And you should see the results.

00:09:42 So yeah, I was quite excited about that.

00:09:43 I like it a lot.

00:09:44 And you're right that it is challenging.

00:09:45 You know, as we build up experience and we get used to it, it's like, oh, yeah, you just

00:09:49 fire up the database server and then you connect to it.

00:09:52 Then you do this thing.

00:09:53 But how do you get the database server installed?

00:09:56 What if you have the wrong version?

00:09:57 What if it requires authentication?

00:09:58 What if there's a firewall?

00:10:00 Just like there's layers and layers of places where people get sheared off.

00:10:03 Like, ah, this doesn't work for me.

00:10:05 All right.

00:10:05 And so keeping that simple, it's great.

00:10:07 And I think I just want to give a shout out to SQLite.

00:10:10 Because what you just said is such a good example of you're probably going to run this

00:10:14 against Postgres or something like that.

00:10:16 Yeah.

00:10:16 But for the little example, you don't need that.

00:10:18 You can just use SQLite.

00:10:19 And it's so nice that that's a serverless in the sense that it's just embedded.

00:10:24 Doesn't require a separate process to run or connect to.

00:10:26 It's already comes with Python, generally speaking.

00:10:29 It's really nice.

00:10:30 Yeah, I totally agree.

00:10:31 And that's the reason for SQLite support within Piccolo.

00:10:33 Because as you said, no one's going to run it in production.

00:10:35 But then it's just that frictionless setup, which is so great.

00:10:39 Like, using SQLite asynchronously doesn't really make a lot of sense.

00:10:43 Because you don't really have any network lag talking to the database.

00:10:46 But it's great to have it in there for convenience.

00:10:48 Yeah, it is.

00:10:49 You know, I suspect there may be some people who run it in production in like an early, early

00:10:53 prototype stage.

00:10:54 Yeah.

00:10:55 They just want to get something up.

00:10:56 And here, let's just put it up on, you know, on some hosting place and just check it out

00:11:00 real quick.

00:11:00 And then we'll go from there.

00:11:01 Yeah.

00:11:01 One thing that's quite nice is I used to do this in the design agency.

00:11:05 We'd use SQLite for the prototype.

00:11:06 And then you could R-sync it down to your local machine.

00:11:09 So you didn't have to do a database dump and reload it.

00:11:12 You could literally just R-sync the file.

00:11:13 Yeah.

00:11:14 So there are a bunch of conveniences with SQLite for sure.

00:11:17 Yeah.

00:11:17 So it gets to be too much data.

00:11:18 Or really, you want sort of too much concurrency or multi-machines scale out and all that sort

00:11:24 of stuff.

00:11:24 So it's not the final destination.

00:11:25 But I do think it's a really interesting and important starting ground there.

00:11:28 Yeah, for sure.

00:11:29 Yeah.

00:11:30 So I gave a shout out to two ORMs already, the Django one and SQLAlchemy.

00:11:36 And I feel like those are probably the two big hitters of the Python space, although there

00:11:41 are many, many more.

00:11:42 So why not just use those?

00:11:44 Why go and create Piccolo?

00:11:46 Yeah.

00:11:46 So when I started it, there was no async options for ORMs at all.

00:11:50 It was all very new.

00:11:52 And my day job involved async programming all of the time.

00:11:56 Because of chat apps, online games, that kind of stuff.

00:11:58 So that was really why I was like, well, nothing really served my needs at the time.

00:12:02 Right.

00:12:02 Because until recently, SQLAlchemy had no async capabilities.

00:12:07 Yeah.

00:12:08 And Django ORM more or less still doesn't, right?

00:12:10 That's the final part that they're trying to move to async.

00:12:13 Yeah.

00:12:13 So the workaround is to run it in a thread, but it's just not as performant as running

00:12:17 with asyncio directly.

00:12:18 So there's kind of this vacuum for a time with async ORMs.

00:12:21 But then it was also about just starting through a blank sheet of paper and thinking, look,

00:12:26 like we've got all these great tools to work with now in Python 3.6 and onwards.

00:12:30 How can I absolutely push them to the limit?

00:12:33 So the syntax, it uses a lot of direct references to objects rather than strings.

00:12:39 So for example, in Django, you do my table to objects and then dot filter and you name equals

00:12:46 Dan.

00:12:47 The problem with that is you can quite easily make a mistake as the code changes.

00:12:52 So you might end up having a column which no longer exists or so strings can be a little

00:12:58 bit fragile.

00:12:59 So with Piccolo, it's just object references everywhere.

00:13:02 So rather than name, it's in this example here, it's band dot name where band is the

00:13:07 name of the table.

00:13:08 Right.

00:13:08 So it's like many of the ORMs, it's sort of class OOP based, right?

00:13:13 So you create a class that maps to a table and database, right?

00:13:16 Yeah.

00:13:17 So there's one distinction I'd like to make quickly as well.

00:13:19 So there's ORMs and then there's query builders.

00:13:21 And in Python, there's not really too much of a distinction, but in other languages like

00:13:25 JavaScript, query builders are really popular as like a separate idea to ORMs.

00:13:30 And query builders, they kind of, you create a SQL query, you execute it on the database,

00:13:35 and then you tend to work more with dictionaries and lists rather than objects.

00:13:39 So I'd say that 90% of Piccolo is a query builder, but people are used to ORMs and Python and it

00:13:46 can actually lead you to some quite poor patterns, ORMs, because what the first thing people learn

00:13:51 with Django is they'll go my table dot objects dot get.

00:13:55 So it returns an object and then they'll change the attributes of the object and then they'll

00:13:59 call save.

00:14:00 But then that's actually two database queries because you have to get it and then you have

00:14:03 to update it.

00:14:04 Well, and it's not just two database queries.

00:14:05 It can be a lot of serialization.

00:14:07 Yeah.

00:14:08 Like the slowest part of all of my data stack is if I were to try to pull back 10,000 records

00:14:15 at a time, it's the deserialization of those 10,000 things that is actually the slowest part

00:14:19 of the entire process.

00:14:21 And here, if what you're talking about, like you're talking about the band, if the band

00:14:25 has tons of information and you just want to change the name, right?

00:14:29 You're pulling all that data back, converting it or whatever, then changing the thing and

00:14:33 then pushing it back down.

00:14:34 Yeah.

00:14:34 It's a lot of work.

00:14:35 And a lot of the time what will happen is you'll serialize it into an object and then

00:14:38 you'll deserialize it out into JSON anyway.

00:14:41 And it's kind of pointless when you think about it.

00:14:44 And there's also the problem with objects getting stale.

00:14:46 So you might pull an object into memory, but then some other user might manipulate all those

00:14:51 objects.

00:14:51 But then when you save it, are you going to overwrite those fields that have been updated

00:14:54 in the database?

00:14:55 So it's problematic in a way.

00:14:57 So it is an ORM, but then I'd really encourage people to look at it as a query builder too,

00:15:02 because in my own apps, I use the select method a lot.

00:15:06 So rather than returning the objects, it returns dictionaries.

00:15:09 And then it has this option, an output method.

00:15:12 So you can just literally deserialize it straight into JSON.

00:15:15 So this is what makes it fast because the query is going through async PG, which is super

00:15:20 fast.

00:15:21 And then it's coming back as a dictionary straight from async PG.

00:15:24 And then it's using all JSON to stick it straight into a string.

00:15:28 So you're kind of missing, you're skipping all this deserialization nonsense.

00:15:32 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:32 This is super interesting.

00:15:34 Now that you pointed out, I'm not used to seeing projections in ORMs.

00:15:39 What I'm used to seeing is give me back the classes that, in this case, a band, right?

00:15:44 Do a query like where the popularity is greater than 100 or whatever, and give me a whole bunch

00:15:47 of bands, band objects back, and then I'm going to work with them.

00:15:51 But sometimes like the one I work with most commonly is Mongo Engine.

00:15:55 I know it's not an ORM, it's an ODM, but close enough.

00:15:58 Does the serialization bit.

00:15:59 And you can say, I don't really want the other parts.

00:16:02 Just give me the name, like the website or something.

00:16:04 And it won't ship or deserialize those things.

00:16:07 But you just end up with the same objects that just have none everywhere else, right?

00:16:11 Where in your ORM, you can actually say band.select, band.name, band.url, or something like that.

00:16:19 And that would return the dictionary with those two things, right?

00:16:21 A list of dictionaries, probably?

00:16:23 A list of dictionaries, yeah.

00:16:24 And then it also has a feature, like Django has this feature, which is invaluable.

00:16:28 It's called values list.

00:16:30 And so if you just want one value back, it'll then condense it down to just a list of values.

00:16:35 Right.

00:16:35 Like I want all the IDs of the bands that play pop music or something.

00:16:39 Yeah, and it's so much more efficient than doing like in Django, you know, band.orl,

00:16:44 objects.all, and then looping through to get the IDs.

00:16:47 It's just these little tricks you learn.

00:16:49 Like if you use Django for ages, you just learn these little tricks.

00:16:53 Right.

00:16:53 Another one that stood out to me is the ability to do set-based operations.

00:16:58 Because when I think of ORMs, I just, for everyone listening, I adore ORMs.

00:17:02 I think they're really empowering for people.

00:17:04 I think they take a lot of the modern tooling that we love, like refactoring, and allow you

00:17:10 to apply that like over to your query.

00:17:12 Because if you wanted to like change the casing of band.name, you could refactor, rename that,

00:17:17 and it would affect your queries because that's still Python code, right?

00:17:20 That said, there are places where people either abuse it or it's just inappropriate.

00:17:24 So the places where it gets abused a lot would be the N plus one problem, right?

00:17:29 Where you've got a lazy reference to something else.

00:17:32 And you don't know that that's going to be a separate query for every time you touch one

00:17:36 of those.

00:17:36 And you get a list of objects back and you loop over them and you access like, in your example,

00:17:40 you've got band.manager.

00:17:42 For B and band, band.manager, right?

00:17:44 That could be 101 queries for what should have been one, right?

00:17:48 Yeah, that's a really good point.

00:17:49 And even experienced developers get this wrong because they might use serializers, which are

00:17:53 calling properties under the hood on the table, which are triggering SQL queries.

00:17:56 So this is another design intent behind Piccolo is whenever a query is run, it's very explicit.

00:18:02 You are literally calling .run or .runsync.

00:18:05 So there's none of this magic.

00:18:07 You can't accidentally create an N plus one query.

00:18:09 You might accidentally end up with a coroutine or something.

00:18:11 Yeah.

00:18:12 So yeah, it's a really good point because I think N plus one is kind of like the scourge of

00:18:16 developers with performance.

00:18:17 And also coming back to your point about ORMs, as a backend developer, we can spend hours a day

00:18:22 using ORMs.

00:18:23 It's kind of like one of the main tools in our tool belt.

00:18:26 So it's kind of quite nice to start from a blank sheet of paper and think, how can I make

00:18:30 that experience maybe like slightly better if I can?

00:19:42 The N plus one problem, I believe, is either there's some tool doing something behind the

00:19:49 scenes you don't know, but often it's just a lack of understanding.

00:19:51 Oh, that actually is a lazily loaded property, which is going to trigger a query, so I should

00:19:57 have put a join, and then I'd be in a better place.

00:20:00 That's a programmer pattern thing that you should pay attention to and work with.

00:20:04 The one where I don't know how to fix it is more like the serialization thing.

00:20:08 Like, what if I want to go through my database and go to 10,000 records and make some changes

00:20:14 to them?

00:20:14 So often it's do the query, loop over the 10,000 things, make a change, call save.

00:20:20 Maybe it's in one giant transaction that you finally push the changes back, but you're

00:20:25 pulling all the data back.

00:20:27 And one of the things I really like about your, or I'm here, is like this update section here,

00:20:33 where you can do set-based operations without pulling the records back.

00:20:37 Yeah.

00:20:37 So you can do stuff like, so this example here, wait, band.update, band.popularity, 10,000.

00:20:42 But then you can also do band.popularity is band.popularity plus 10.

00:20:47 And then in the database, it will then just add 10 to all of the numbers.

00:20:50 Oh, really?

00:20:51 That's awesome.

00:20:52 And then it's all just magic around, you know, Python magic methods.

00:20:56 It's just, as a library author, it gives you so much power.

00:20:59 It's one of the things I love about Python.

00:21:01 Yeah.

00:21:01 Because when you're building like query languages, like ORMs, I think very few languages can

00:21:06 really rival Python with its flexibility.

00:21:08 Yeah.

00:21:09 So that's really why a lot of this stuff's possible.

00:21:11 It's really neat.

00:21:11 And I think the ability to push these changes without actually, you're still programming

00:21:17 in this, the ORM classes and the models, but you're not actually pushing a whole bunch of

00:21:21 them back and forth to make the changes, but to do these set-based operations, like delete

00:21:25 them where, or make this update to this value where this is true, and then just push that,

00:21:30 make that happen in the best way you can with SQL, right?

00:21:33 Yeah, exactly.

00:21:34 I think coming back to your point around the M plus one, I think properties are something

00:21:39 that can be a little bit evil.

00:21:40 And I've really shy away from them in the Piccolo code because it can, you call a property

00:21:46 and you think you're getting a value back, but it could be doing any kind of magic.

00:21:49 And then once you've defined something as a property, you then can't add arguments to

00:21:55 it without breaking your API.

00:21:56 So yeah, I think that that's something I've tried to steer away from in general with Piccolo,

00:22:00 like properties.

00:22:01 Yeah.

00:22:01 A lot of hidden stuff happening there, right?

00:22:04 Yeah.

00:22:05 It's not entirely clear.

00:22:06 I think they're super useful, but certainly in something where I thought I was accessing

00:22:10 a field of the class, but what I actually did is make a network call.

00:22:13 Like that distinction is possibly too big of a bridge to just make that automatic a lot

00:22:18 of the times.

00:22:18 Yeah.

00:22:19 There's no async properties in Python as well.

00:22:22 So that's kind of one of the reasons why it doesn't use any async properties.

00:22:25 Maybe they'll add it.

00:22:27 If they add it, maybe I'll put a comment on the PEP saying, don't do it.

00:22:30 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:32 Another thing that's interesting here is on all this code, every code you've written

00:22:36 is await band.select or await band.delete and so on or update.

00:22:41 And then at the end, you say run.

00:22:43 This is the explicit part that you were talking about in your API.

00:22:46 Like I know here's where it's happening.

00:22:48 And it probably makes a lot of sense to do that as well, because on the flip side of it,

00:22:52 that's where you have to await it anyway, right?

00:22:54 Yeah.

00:22:54 So what happens is you build up this query, you just chain methods to it.

00:22:58 And then at any point you can print out that object and I'll give you the SQL.

00:23:02 And then until you actually await it, there's something under the hood that I don't really

00:23:07 publicize.

00:23:07 You don't need the dot run.

00:23:09 If you await it, it will run as a convenience because people forget.

00:23:12 But then it just makes it easier from a documentation perspective to say when it's async, use run.

00:23:17 And when it's synchronous, use run sync.

00:23:19 Right.

00:23:20 And then if you do run sync, then I've got like a bit of magic in there where it tries to

00:23:26 create an event loop to run it, or it tries to figure out if there's already an event

00:23:29 loop.

00:23:30 If there is, run it in there.

00:23:31 So you can use Piccolo in an old school WSGI app if you wanted to just synchronously.

00:23:37 Yeah.

00:23:38 Well, let's dive into that because that's one of the things that really stood out to me.

00:23:41 Many frameworks or APIs packages tell you, you're going to either have to go, you know,

00:23:47 you're going to take a fork in the road.

00:23:48 You're going to go down the async fork and you're going to use the async library like

00:23:51 HTTPX or you're going to go on another fork and you're going to use the request library

00:23:55 that has no async.

00:23:56 And you're going to go down that path and you choose and then you just go.

00:24:00 And with Piccolo, you can actually run, I guess the default behavior would be to be async and

00:24:07 await.

00:24:07 But it has this dot run sync, which will kind of cap where the asynchronous behaves and goes.

00:24:13 And it'll just that you could run it in a regular Flask app or Django app or whatever

00:24:18 and not worry about it being async at all.

00:24:20 Right.

00:24:21 Yeah, that's right.

00:24:21 And it's actually one of the design challenges with Piccolo is how do you create an API which

00:24:25 is synchronous and asynchronous?

00:24:27 And there's only really two ways of achieving it is with a method like run or run sync or

00:24:33 with context managers.

00:24:34 So some of them you'll create either an async context manager or synchronous, and then that

00:24:40 will then impact whether the underlying query is synchronous or not.

00:24:43 But then it adds a little bit more boilerplate if every time you're in a query, you need

00:24:47 a context manager to tell it to be async.

00:24:49 So this is kind of the best outcome I could think of was just have dot run or dot run sync.

00:24:55 I think this is great, especially since even if you forget the run, it'll still run async,

00:24:59 but there's a way to kind of cap it.

00:25:01 So something I wanted to talk about, it's driven me crazy ever since async and await were introduced

00:25:07 because I don't find it to be true, but I hear it all the time spoken about in the community

00:25:12 async and await, they're super neat, but they're like viruses.

00:25:16 And in the sense that soon as like one of your functions way, way at the bottom has to do

00:25:21 something async, well, then the thing that calls it has to be async and await it.

00:25:24 And the things that call that function now all have to await it.

00:25:27 And that percolates all the way to the top of your app.

00:25:30 And so now you've, by using any async library, you've turned your entire thing into this like

00:25:34 async vertical call stack.

00:25:36 Your example here shows that that's not, it doesn't have to be that way, right?

00:25:40 That's sort of the naive, I'm just going to like write the code without thinking about it.

00:25:43 But if you wanted to say, have your data access layer do three things, because it's got to pull

00:25:49 some stuff from different places.

00:25:51 You want that to be async.

00:25:52 It doesn't mean that function has to be async.

00:25:54 It could just start its own event loop, do the three things faster than without it,

00:25:57 and then return the answers, right?

00:25:59 You can kind of cap it at any level that you want.

00:26:01 And your run sync is kind of an example of that.

00:26:04 Like you can choose to not have it, just turn your entire app async.

00:26:08 You can jump between them.

00:26:09 So typically if people use an async, then it's like, the argument is, if you need async,

00:26:13 your whole app probably should be async because otherwise why use an async?

00:26:18 But then you can flip between them quite easily.

00:26:20 So if you've got a synchronous app and you want to call some async code,

00:26:23 there's asyncio.run.

00:26:24 And you can also do stuff like spin up an event loop in a different thread and then send

00:26:29 work to that.

00:26:30 Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:31 So it is quite fluid.

00:26:32 You can flip between them quite easily.

00:26:34 Yeah, I mean, just one example that comes to mind is what if I wanted to go web scrape

00:26:39 every page at a certain domain?

00:26:41 So I've got a function that gives me a domain.

00:26:43 I give it a domain and then I want it to return or store into the database all the pages, right?

00:26:49 That would be perfectly reasonable to have that thing go, okay, well, let's do a,

00:26:53 a request, figure out what all the pages are, and then just, you know, recursively sort of grab them

00:26:57 all asynchronously.

00:26:58 You would get a huge boost on getting every page off a site, even if that function blocked.

00:27:03 You know what I mean?

00:27:04 Because it itself could just go crazy against the server.

00:27:06 Maybe it shouldn't, but it could.

00:27:08 Yeah.

00:27:08 I'm a huge fan of asyncio.gather as well.

00:27:11 So that's a really beautiful API just for saying, do these 50 things now, please.

00:27:15 And let me know when you're done.

00:27:17 Yeah.

00:27:17 And block, right?

00:27:18 When you're done, give me a list of answers or errors.

00:27:21 Yeah.

00:27:22 Also out in the live stream, Chris May.

00:27:23 Hey, Chris.

00:27:24 It says, I'm so excited to use Piccolo with unsync.

00:27:27 I have a workflow that'd be nice to parallelize.

00:27:29 And yeah, so I think unsync is another really interesting library that wraps up asyncio plus

00:27:36 threading plus multi-processing.

00:27:38 But then gives you a nice way to cap it as well because you can go, like, be given a task that

00:27:43 comes back from there.

00:27:44 If you just ask for the result and it's not done, it'll just block like a regular thing.

00:27:48 And it does kind of what you're talking about.

00:27:50 It'll have a, it has a background thread with its own event loop and it just pushes all the

00:27:54 work over to there.

00:27:55 Yeah.

00:27:56 So, yeah.

00:27:56 That's a cool library.

00:27:58 Yeah, it is.

00:27:59 At least for the size, right?

00:28:00 Like 126 lines and it unifies those three APIs and adds some more stuff.

00:28:05 That's pretty big bang for the Python byte.

00:28:08 Yeah, that's impressive.

00:28:09 I wish Piccolo was that terse.

00:28:11 I think thousands, tens of thousands of lines by now.

00:28:14 Yeah.

00:28:15 Yeah.

00:28:15 Yeah.

00:28:16 So another one of the new Python 3, 6 onward type of things that's really cool is the type

00:28:22 annotations.

00:28:23 Yeah.

00:28:23 I love type annotations.

00:28:24 So part of my day job in the past was using Swift and Swift is almost like hyphens, like

00:28:30 brother or sister.

00:28:31 It was very heavily inspired by Python.

00:28:33 Right.

00:28:34 It's like if Python all of a sudden decided it was incredibly strict about typing,

00:28:37 and type definitions.

00:28:39 Yeah.

00:28:40 That would be a lot like Swift, right?

00:28:41 Inward compiled.

00:28:42 Yeah.

00:28:42 It's a combination of type annotations and the tooling to support it.

00:28:45 So in Python's case, it's VS Code.

00:28:47 And in Swift's case, it's X code.

00:28:48 And it just means that when you're refactoring, it just makes it so much more confident about

00:28:53 what's going on.

00:28:54 Yeah.

00:28:54 It provides documentation because previously people were putting in a doc string anyway.

00:28:58 So why not put it in your function definition and then you can introspect it.

00:29:02 And my Pi is incredibly powerful.

00:29:04 I honestly don't think I could have built Piccler without type annotations because it makes your

00:29:09 code so much more maintainable.

00:29:10 The click to go to VS Code as well is just a beautiful usability improvement.

00:29:16 And then kind of one of the hidden benefits is it makes tab completion so good.

00:29:20 So a lot of Python auto completions, they use a library called Jedi under the hood.

00:29:26 So when I was building Piccolo, I had to look at the source code to try and figure out how

00:29:30 it does its magic.

00:29:31 And if you give a type annotation to something like this is what this function returns, it's

00:29:35 a really strong indicator to Jedi that this is what's going to get returned.

00:29:40 I don't need to do any magic anymore.

00:29:41 Yeah.

00:29:41 I would say that half the time, that's why I do it is to make the editor better.

00:29:45 So both VS Code and PyCharm, like take a good look at what the type annotations are.

00:29:50 Yeah.

00:29:50 Right.

00:29:51 And you just say, oh, you're trying to pass a string and that's really supposed to be

00:29:54 an integer.

00:29:54 But then also, like you say, tab completion or autocomplete all over the place is fantastic.

00:29:59 Yeah.

00:29:59 I think there's a distinction as well, where I think if you're building an application,

00:30:02 let's say you're building a Django app or a Flask app, you don't need to care quite as

00:30:05 much.

00:30:06 Like I personally would still add type annotations, but for libraries, I think it's just absolutely

00:30:10 essential.

00:30:11 Like I don't think any new Python library should be written without it because you kind of,

00:30:15 shortchanging your users in a way.

00:30:18 Is there?

00:30:18 I totally agree.

00:30:19 Yeah.

00:30:20 Yeah.

00:30:20 In the Flask app, for example, that you've mentioned, you know, I would say on the boundaries,

00:30:25 right?

00:30:25 Like here's a data access layer, like put type annotations on those little bits there.

00:30:29 And then the rest of the app, usually the editors and the tools will just pick it up

00:30:33 and continue to tell you what you're working with.

00:30:35 Yeah.

00:30:36 But if you're doing a library, right?

00:30:37 You want every function or every class to be kind of standalone and know everything it

00:30:42 can.

00:30:42 Yeah, definitely.

00:30:43 And one more thing about type annotations is it's probably the greatest source of interview

00:30:47 questions ever made because you can ask people in an interview, what's the difference between

00:30:51 like a sequence and an iterable?

00:30:52 And like when you use type annotations, you really start to think about what's going on.

00:30:57 And it's a great learning experience too.

00:30:59 Yeah.

00:30:59 I want to pass a generator here, but it takes a list of things and it says that won't work.

00:31:03 And maybe you just need to relax your type annotations to an iterator.

00:31:07 Yeah.

00:31:08 A thing.

00:31:09 A quick question from Roller out there in the live stream.

00:31:11 Hey, Roller.

00:31:12 Can I just pick a little and play some Mongo engine or is it just for a relational stuff?

00:31:16 Yeah.

00:31:17 It's just relational and it's, you can use SQLite locally, but it's mostly Postgres.

00:31:21 It was really built to take advantage of Postgres because Postgres is, it's like the fastest

00:31:27 growing SQL database in the world, which is remarkable to think it's how old it is.

00:31:32 And I think I'll, you know, I think adding other SQL databases would be quite easy, but

00:31:37 adding something like Mongo would be a bit trickier.

00:31:40 I wouldn't say it was impossible, but a bit more work.

00:31:42 Yeah.

00:31:42 I would think so.

00:31:43 Yeah.

00:31:43 It's not, certainly not impossible, but like joins and stuff would get tricky.

00:31:47 What about SQL injection?

00:31:49 I mean, many of us have heard about the little Bobby tables, XKCD, which is delightful, you

00:31:55 know, you know, sort of schadenfreude sort of way.

00:31:58 We all kind of want to relish in somebody else suffering this, but I find that this is actually

00:32:04 one of the really nice things about ORMs most of the time is that they scrape off the ability

00:32:10 to do SQL injection because you're not building the SQL.

00:32:13 Yeah, definitely.

00:32:14 So your database adapter.

00:32:16 So something like async PG or psycopg in the synchronous world, what you want to do is you

00:32:21 want to pass it the query string with placeholders for any user submitted values.

00:32:25 And then you submit the values that separately, like in a list.

00:32:29 Right.

00:32:29 Like a parameterized query, basically.

00:32:32 Yeah.

00:32:32 And as long as you do that, you're safe.

00:32:34 But then for a library, when people are programmatically creating very complex SQL queries, and then you

00:32:40 need to try and make sure that you've got the right values that match the right placeholders

00:32:45 to pass to the adapter.

00:32:46 It is quite challenging.

00:32:48 There's some like recursive code where it has to.

00:32:51 So we use something called query strings internally within Piccolo.

00:32:53 So it never concatenates strings for SQL statements.

00:32:57 It just, it uses query strings and then it compiles them before sending it to the database adapter.

00:33:02 And it basically looks through all of the sub query strings it might have if it's a really

00:33:06 complex query.

00:33:07 And then it kind of passes it to the adapter.

00:33:10 But yeah, it's just one of the complex things about building ORMs for sure.

00:33:14 And also one of the most dangerous to get wrong.

00:33:16 Yeah.

00:33:16 Yeah, it absolutely is.

00:33:17 There's untold number of bad things that can happen with SQL injection.

00:33:22 And it's so easy.

00:33:23 All you have to do is put a single little tick to comment out stuff, semicolon to finish that

00:33:30 statement.

00:33:30 And then you can run arbitrary code.

00:33:32 And a lot of times you can even, some database engines will let you run sub process type things.

00:33:38 Which is even worse.

00:33:39 But yeah, it's not good.

00:33:41 So you definitely want to avoid it.

00:33:42 Yeah, it's a good argument for using ORMs and query builders because it'll make it less

00:33:46 likely.

00:33:46 I think for sure.

00:33:47 You know, another thing that I wanted to touch on a little bit here is the actual filtering

00:33:53 or projection statement type bits.

00:33:56 So I mentioned using Mongo Engine before, which I'm a big fan of.

00:33:59 And it's basically a Mongo equivalent of the Django ORM.

00:34:03 So in that regard, they're real similar.

00:34:05 And you do things like, if I wanted to say where the band popularity, or let's say the

00:34:10 band name is Pythonistas, right?

00:34:12 You would just say name equals Pythonistas as part of the filter.

00:34:16 And there's two things that are crummy about that.

00:34:19 One is you get no autocomplete that there's a column called name because it doesn't really

00:34:24 know what class, even though you started out like band.objects.

00:34:27 It doesn't, in the filter part, it no longer knows that the name came from the band, right?

00:34:31 That's not part of the language.

00:34:33 And then the other one is you're doing an equals or you've got like weird operators like in

00:34:38 the name, like name underscore underscore GT for greater than and stuff like that.

00:34:43 Whereas yours, you just write what you would put into an if statement or a loop or something

00:34:48 like that.

00:34:49 So you would say like band.popularity less than a thousand.

00:34:51 That's the thing you send in there.

00:34:53 Yeah, that's right.

00:34:53 So I've been caught up, tripped up so many times in the past with Django where I've had

00:34:58 something like name double underscore something else.

00:35:01 And then it can't really understand that's wrong, like a linter or when you, while you're

00:35:07 coding, it only really knows at a runtime and then you've got a 500 error.

00:35:09 So the idea here is a linter would be able to pick up these problems.

00:35:14 Exactly.

00:35:14 Because so much of the pieces are, they're just using star, star, kwrgs and then they

00:35:19 figure out how to generate a query out of like looking for special keywords in the key names

00:35:25 and then turning those to columns.

00:35:27 Also the refactoring thing, right?

00:35:28 The linters.

00:35:29 And if I want to do a refactoring to rename popularity, it's not going to check popularity

00:35:34 underscore GT as a keyword argument.

00:35:37 It has no idea those are related.

00:35:38 Yeah.

00:35:38 Yeah, definitely.

00:35:40 So the way it's implemented this, the double equals and all these operators is the amazing

00:35:45 things about Python is how you can just overload like fundamental things about the language.

00:35:50 So you can overload what addition means.

00:35:52 And when someone first tells you that, it sounds like the most mental thing in the world.

00:35:55 Cause why would you want one plus one to equal five?

00:35:57 But then it turns out when you're building an ORM, it's golden.

00:36:01 And this is one reason why I find Python just so compelling over and over again is because

00:36:06 as a library author, you can do this stuff that you can get closer to more of like a DSL than

00:36:12 like a normal programming language.

00:36:14 Specific language.

00:36:14 Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:15 Yeah.

00:36:16 So is this a be done with descriptors or what's the magic?

00:36:19 For the less than there's like done like double underscore LT and you can override that.

00:36:25 And then what happens is when you call that method, it returns a where object.

00:36:28 And then you can also, you could do in brackets, band dot popularity, less than a thousand and

00:36:34 then double and sign as well.

00:36:35 Band dot popularity greater than 500.

00:36:38 So you can combine them with and and all statements.

00:36:41 So the where statements in Piccolo can get like really powerful.

00:36:44 So you just have to teach the where clauses how to and and then structure it in a way that

00:36:49 Python will let it kind of go through, right?

00:36:51 Yeah.

00:36:52 Or you can do dot where, put some stuff and then another dot where statement.

00:36:55 And if you've got multiple where statements, it becomes like it's an and.

00:36:58 Yeah.

00:36:58 But yeah, it's just, it's just all Python magic, which is one of the reasons I love Python.

00:37:02 Yeah.

00:37:03 Speaking of overridden things, the thing that I think is the most insane, but I'm starting

00:37:08 to love, but took a while to get used to is the way the path object works for defining

00:37:13 paths.

00:37:14 Yeah.

00:37:14 So, you know, the forward slash often means like drive separation on the POSIX systems.

00:37:21 And, you know, it's close enough.

00:37:22 You could actually put forward slash in your strings and Python on Windows and it'll

00:37:25 still like, okay, fine.

00:37:26 Backslash is what you meant.

00:37:27 So they overrode the divide operator in code to allow you to concatenate strings and paths

00:37:34 together.

00:37:35 And that's just crazy.

00:37:36 Yeah.

00:37:37 The first time I saw it, I was very confused, but when you understand that it's okay, but

00:37:40 yeah, totally.

00:37:41 Yeah.

00:37:42 I'm, I've gotten okay with it as well.

00:37:45 And I start to use it and I really like it now, but I was like, I don't know if I can

00:37:47 get behind.

00:37:48 This is, this is a bridge too far.

00:37:49 This is, that's division.

00:37:51 What are we doing here?

00:37:51 No, it's cool.

00:37:52 It's cool.

00:37:53 Talking of magic to Piccolo, like all around, it uses meta classes a lot.

00:37:57 And there's something that got added in, I don't know if it's Python 3.7 or 3.6, but they

00:38:02 actually changed meta classes slightly.

00:38:04 So there's now like a Dunder magic method called init subclass.

00:38:07 And Piccolo uses this a lot.

00:38:08 And it's, it's actually an amazing hidden feature of Python where you can now add keyword

00:38:14 arguments to a class definition.

00:38:15 So if you had class foo, open brackets, inherits from bar, comma, and then you can start adding

00:38:21 keyword arguments to the class to customize its creation.

00:38:24 And that's kind of like a new layer of magic that's been added to Python recently.

00:38:29 And Piccolo uses it extensively, but I don't see many other libraries using it yet because

00:38:33 it's probably not so well known, but yeah, just kind of spread that bit of magic.

00:38:37 So hopefully people can use it too.

00:38:39 Nice.

00:38:39 Yeah.

00:38:39 That sounds awesome.

00:38:40 I can certainly see how I'm like trying to create the classes, like the band class or

00:38:44 whatever you say that it's going to be, would definitely use that.

00:38:47 So one of the things that you say is awesome about Piccolo is the batteries included.

00:38:52 Yeah.

00:38:52 So let's talk about some of the batteries.

00:38:54 So yeah.

00:38:56 So the main battery by far is the admin, because when I started it, I was working for a design

00:39:00 agency and admins are incredibly important for design agencies because you want to put

00:39:05 something in front of a customer that they like the look of and they're comfortable using.

00:39:08 So this is a huge part of the effort that's gone into Piccolo.

00:39:12 And so this is a, it's sister project called Piccolo admin.

00:39:15 And what happens is it's, it's an ASCII app.

00:39:17 So I can maybe go into more detail about ASCII later on, but all you do is you give it a

00:39:21 list of Piccolo tables and then it uses Pydantic.

00:39:25 So Pydantic is a serialization library and it basically creates a Pydantic model from the

00:39:30 Piccolo table.

00:39:31 And then Pydantic models have this really useful method where it's JSON schema and it creates

00:39:38 a JSON schema for the Pydantic model.

00:39:39 Right.

00:39:40 Because the Pydantic classes know this field is an int, this one is an optional date time

00:39:45 and so on.

00:39:45 Yeah.

00:39:46 So Piccolo has really good Pydantic support, but it's in a sister repo called Piccolo API.

00:39:50 And then that, so that creates the Pydantic model and it also has something called Piccolo

00:39:55 CRUD.

00:39:56 So you give it a Piccolo table and it creates another ASCII app, which has got all of the CRUD

00:40:02 operations for your database.

00:40:03 So you can programmatically create this huge API just by giving it a few tables.

00:40:07 And then the front end is written in Vue.js and it's completely decoupled from the back

00:40:12 end.

00:40:12 It's just all by API.

00:40:13 So yeah, I'm a huge fan of Vue.js because it's, it's very natural for Python developers

00:40:18 who are used to the template syntax in Django and Flask.

00:40:21 If you looked at the Vue templates, you'd be like, this looks very familiar.

00:40:24 So I'm a big fan of that.

00:40:26 Yeah, it's nice.

00:40:26 Yeah.

00:40:27 I think it's super close to Chameleon because of the attribute driven behavior as well.

00:40:31 Yeah.

00:40:31 Yeah.

00:40:32 But then like to make a working admin requires so much work because you've also got the security

00:40:36 side.

00:40:36 So Piccolo API has a bunch of really useful ASCII middleware and it has like session authentication,

00:40:42 CSRF protection and rate limiting as well because you don't want people to spam the login.

00:40:47 So like just to get a fairly simple admin is in, it's like a iceberg to do it properly.

00:40:54 So yeah, a lot of efforts gone into the admin, but I'm really proud of it.

00:40:58 And like, this is really what excites me more than anything about the future because as

00:41:02 we add support for post GIS and stuff like that, being able to create really interesting

00:41:06 widgets around data.

00:41:08 So, you know, how can I design a rectangle field for post GIS or a location field or.

00:41:14 I could see some really cool stuff that are sort of template extensions, you know, like

00:41:19 let's just pick Jinja, for example.

00:41:20 Like if you had one of these objects, you could pass it over and it knew, for example, here's

00:41:26 a daytime, you could just say, make a calendar picker here.

00:41:29 And it just, you know, as long as you have the JavaScript included and instead of just

00:41:33 putting the text, it gives you like a nice little Ajax-y widget or these, this list goes

00:41:39 on a map, drop in the map widget and off it goes.

00:41:42 Yeah.

00:41:42 So basically Piccolo admin, it's just, it's just turns Pydantic models into UI and it's

00:41:48 actually quite, it's actually quite interesting.

00:41:50 And I'd love to get it to the point where for a business app, you just use Piccolo admin,

00:41:53 you don't even have to build UI.

00:41:55 You just say, here are my tables.

00:41:56 Yeah.

00:41:57 And then, yeah.

00:41:58 Well, the truth is so often, like there's a lot of these little internal apps that people

00:42:02 build that are just like forms over data.

00:42:04 I just need to see the details, click on one, edit it, create a new one and delete one.

00:42:08 And like, that's the app I need for this table.

00:42:10 Could you build that?

00:42:11 Right?

00:42:12 Yeah, for sure.

00:42:13 It is a lot of it.

00:42:14 Cause I think with the approach I talked to Piccolo is you have a lot of Python libraries

00:42:18 and they kind of start from the outside in.

00:42:20 So they start from the URL layer and then the views and like middleware.

00:42:24 And then over time, they then add the data layer and the security.

00:42:27 But then with Piccolo, it's kind of from the inside out.

00:42:30 Like I started from the data layer and then have the admin and some middleware.

00:42:34 So it's quite a nice companion to have a ASCII app.

00:42:36 So just kind of pick the framework you like and then Piccolo kind of gives you the data

00:42:40 layer and the admin.

00:42:41 That's kind of.

00:42:41 Yeah.

00:42:42 Yeah.

00:42:42 Yeah.

00:42:43 Well, let's talk about the ASCII stuff a little bit.

00:42:44 Cause you did mention that there's some interesting support for those things.

00:42:49 And it's got like, to some degree, native FastAPI, Flask, and even Blacksheep, which is

00:42:56 an interesting one, support for those frameworks, right?

00:42:58 Yeah.

00:42:59 So I'm a huge fan of ASCII because I was a Django Channels power user and Andrew Godwin

00:43:04 created ASCII out of Django Channels.

00:43:06 It's really like a beautiful thing.

00:43:09 If you look, so Starlette was the one that really built the foundation.

00:43:12 So this is an async library, but also kind of like a framework.

00:43:17 Like you can build an app with Starlette or you can use it to build up frameworks.

00:43:20 What's amazing about ASCII is like every component in an ASCII framework is ASCII.

00:43:25 So ASCII is basically the spec where it's a function that accepts a scope, a send and

00:43:30 a receive.

00:43:31 And then if you look at the internals of Starlet, everything's ASCII, like the middleware's ASCII,

00:43:35 the endpoints are ASCII, like the whole thing.

00:43:37 And it's like super composable.

00:43:39 So you can say, I've got an ASCII app and you can mount other ASCII apps within it.

00:43:44 So this is what I love about ASCII as a spec.

00:43:48 So you can say, take a FastAPI app or a Starlette app and include Piccolo admin.

00:43:52 Same with Blacksheep.

00:43:54 Right. You could say slash catalog is actually handled by this other app written in FastAPI

00:44:00 where the main thing is written in Flask or something like that.

00:44:02 And you just kind of click them together in that cool way.

00:44:04 Maybe Core would have to be the one, but still.

00:44:06 Yeah. And I really love that.

00:44:07 It's quite exciting that you could kind of build an app with multiple frameworks and be like,

00:44:11 well, this part of the app will be better served by FastAPI.

00:44:14 But this bit, I just need Starlette or I want Blacksheep or whichever ASCII framework people

00:44:19 can dream up.

00:44:20 So I think it's really exciting for the Python community, the ASCII spec.

00:44:24 Yeah. And we did talk a little bit about the challenges and the cascading effect of async and await.

00:44:30 But if you're already running a framework that has async view methods, there's just nothing to it, right?

00:44:35 You just write your code and you just await the bits you got to await in the view method.

00:44:39 And it just like the server and the framework handled the vent loops and all that business.

00:44:44 Yeah. I think as well, what kind of happened is asyncio came out and it doesn't directly affect speed.

00:44:49 It's more about throughput, but it's like the Python community took it as a challenge to build faster frameworks.

00:44:55 And so there's a lot of them have really quite fast internals and they do feel quite cutting edge.

00:45:01 Yeah. Like UV loop and stuff like that.

00:45:03 They're like, how can we do this, but have the minimal overhead of adding this?

00:45:07 I mean, people do talk about, okay, async and await won't make your code go faster.

00:45:10 Well, it won't make CPU code go faster.

00:45:12 But so often what we're doing, especially in web apps is waiting.

00:45:15 I want to wait on a database and then wait on the network.

00:45:18 And then I want to wait on the database again.

00:45:19 And then I'm going to wait on an API and then I'm going to send back three lines of JSON, right?

00:45:24 Like 99.9% of that is just waiting on something else.

00:45:27 And when you're using async and await, like you can just do other things while you're doing that 99% of waiting.

00:45:32 Yeah. So usually if you do a database query, it takes a few milliseconds.

00:45:36 But then if you use the time it module on Python and you see how long basic operations take, they're more like microseconds.

00:45:42 So there's like orders of magnitude difference in how long a database query takes to basic Python stuff.

00:45:47 But this is why having stuff like UV loops are really important because if you had a really slow event loop, it kind of wouldn't make much difference.

00:45:53 But because the event loops fast as well.

00:45:55 And like a lot of the projects I did in the past, the throughput is really important because some apps, you won't have a lot of traffic.

00:46:01 And then all of a sudden you'll get a thousand users.

00:46:04 So I was doing like live events and you'd get a thousand people at once.

00:46:08 And in that situation, throughput is incredibly important.

00:46:11 Right. I mean, look at how the whole healthcare rollout in 2008 went.

00:46:15 Right. I just can't help but think there must have been more awaits available to those, that those frameworks and those web apps.

00:46:22 Because it just kept crashing and stuff was timing out.

00:46:24 And I'm sure it's just like, well, we're just going to wait on this other slow government API.

00:46:30 And we're going to do it for a lot of people.

00:46:31 And it's just going to overwhelm it.

00:46:32 Right. And it's just crazy.

00:46:34 It just feels natural because like in the web server world, you had Apache and a lot of people moved to Nginx.

00:46:39 That's very similar.

00:46:39 It's like event loop driven.

00:46:41 And we've kind of seen how beneficial Nginx was.

00:46:43 So it just makes perfect sense to build your backend in the same way.

00:46:47 Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

00:46:48 All right. A couple more things we got some time to talk about.

00:46:51 So over here, you've got a Django comparison page, which I guess also could be slightly a Mongo engine comparison page.

00:46:59 Because like I said, they're basically the same thing without the nesting.

00:47:01 So if somebody is familiar with Django and they're like, I would like to consider using this for my framework or for part of my code or whatever, just like want to use it.

00:47:10 But they already know how to do stuff in Django.

00:47:12 You have like, well, here's how you would create an object and save it in the different frameworks.

00:47:16 Here's how you would update an object and make changes and so on.

00:47:20 And you can just go through one at a time and just sort of compare the different pieces, right?

00:47:24 Yeah.

00:47:25 So it's quite heavily inspired by Django.

00:47:27 But then I think Django in its ORM, it's more Pythonic.

00:47:30 So rather than using where it uses filter.

00:47:33 But then with Piccolo, it's meant to be very, very close to SQL.

00:47:36 Because the theory is, if you know SQL, it'll be super easy to learn.

00:47:40 And when you do need to drop down to a SQL query, there's no like mismatch.

00:47:44 You're just like, well, I'm always sort of working in a SQL mindset.

00:47:47 But there are a lot of similarities with Django still.

00:47:50 I think people could pick it up quite quickly.

00:47:52 Yeah, I agree.

00:47:53 Like instead of object that values list, you have a select projection.

00:47:57 Or instead of filter, you have a where.

00:47:59 But it's honestly not a huge mental jump to make.

00:48:02 Yeah.

00:48:02 And Piccolo also takes like huge inspiration from Django migrations, which I think is kind of like the gold standard of migrations in any language.

00:48:10 So a lot of effort's gone into that.

00:48:13 Yeah.

00:48:13 That's another one of the batteries that you were kind of touching on, right?

00:48:16 Is the migrations bit.

00:48:18 Yeah.

00:48:18 But it's migrations are incredibly hard to do right.

00:48:21 I think the Django way is.

00:48:23 I can only imagine.

00:48:24 I don't even want to try to imagine writing that because it seems really hard.

00:48:28 Yeah.

00:48:28 So the way Django does it is it looks at your tables and then it creates a migration file.

00:48:33 It then adds up the migration files to build a picture of what the schema looks like.

00:48:38 And then that's how it then creates subsequent migrations by doing a diff.

00:48:41 Right.

00:48:42 That's what Piccolo does.

00:48:42 I've got to go from this level to that level.

00:48:44 So here's the five migrations to basically use in order.

00:48:47 Yeah.

00:48:48 And then you've got to do code generation as well.

00:48:50 So like with Piccolo, it has to actually create a Python file.

00:48:53 And that's harder than what it seems actually writing a Python file.

00:48:56 But if you look at the Piccolo migrations, they're actually really, they look like quite beautiful

00:49:00 Python code.

00:49:01 And there's a little trick I use internally.

00:49:03 I use like the black formatter on it before I write out the auto-generated code.

00:49:07 Oh, that's cool.

00:49:08 So your generated code is pep8 and all the goodness.

00:49:11 Yeah.

00:49:11 So if you look at it, you're like, oh, that's quite nice.

00:49:14 That's clever, actually.

00:49:16 Yeah, that's really clever.

00:49:17 Yeah, it's cool.

00:49:18 Black.

00:49:18 Yeah.

00:49:19 Yeah.

00:49:19 I feel like other frameworks, like for example, the cookie cutter stuff, you know, you're just

00:49:24 generating code files like crazy.

00:49:26 I feel like you could apply that same technique as after we inject all the user entered values,

00:49:31 let's just do a quick format on them and then drop them.

00:49:33 Yeah.

00:49:33 It makes sense because otherwise you'll run your linters on your project and they'll fail because

00:49:38 your migrations aren't correctly formatted.

00:49:40 Yeah.

00:49:41 Yeah.

00:49:41 Yeah.

00:49:42 No, that's cool.

00:49:42 A quick question from Teddy out in the live stream.

00:49:45 It says, I don't use ORMs much in my day-to-day.

00:49:48 What are good use cases besides web apps for them and where does Piccolo perform better?

00:49:52 So two questions.

00:49:53 So I think that data science is obviously a big bit.

00:49:57 So another reason for building Piccolo is data science is so much on the ascendancy in the

00:50:02 Python world and people are just, you know, still dealing with databases on a day-to-day

00:50:06 basis.

00:50:06 So you can use it in a script if you like, but there's maybe a couple of examples in the docs

00:50:11 where, you know, you might be scraping some data from a website and then you just need

00:50:15 to stick into Postgres.

00:50:16 So that would be another good example for using Piccolo.

00:50:19 Yeah.

00:50:19 That is a good example.

00:50:20 And then where it performs better.

00:50:22 It's really where you need the async or you might still want a web app component, even if

00:50:28 it's just like a data science script, you still might want an admin screen to view that data.

00:50:32 Yeah.

00:50:32 I think that performs better.

00:50:34 You could maybe break into two pieces.

00:50:36 Where does Piccolo perform better?

00:50:37 And I think the async stuff is really important there, like you say.

00:50:40 And then where does an ORM perform better?

00:50:43 You know, when you talk about performance and getting stuff done, like sometimes it's how

00:50:47 fast is the code run, but sometimes it's how fast do I get the final thing built.

00:50:51 Right.

00:50:52 And I think ORMs, even if they're not always the most efficient way, sometimes they're really

00:50:56 efficient, but not always.

00:50:57 But, you know, they could help you safely get to the other side, especially if you don't

00:51:02 know SQL super well.

00:51:03 Yeah.

00:51:03 They hold your hand a little bit.

00:51:04 Yeah.

00:51:05 I created this while working at a design agency and speed's really important at a design

00:51:09 agency, not really execution speed in terms of SQL queries, but in terms of scaffolding

00:51:13 an app and being productive.

00:51:15 So there's, so Piccolo has something called Piccolo asking you, and then to use that command,

00:51:19 it'll basically scaffold you a web app.

00:51:21 So it supports FastAPI, Starlet, Blacksheep.

00:51:24 Yeah, that's really cool.

00:51:24 So yeah, it's, you just kind of create your starter code and your starter structure from that,

00:51:28 right?

00:51:29 Yeah.

00:51:29 So a bit like with Django where you, you know, you create a project on the command line,

00:51:33 but with Piccolo, you get an option of different ASCII frameworks.

00:51:36 And over time, I'd like to add, you know, way more because there's, there's, there's

00:51:40 many more exciting ASCII frameworks like Quart, Sanic, Django itself is actually an ASCII

00:51:45 app, so it could support Django.

00:51:46 Yeah.

00:51:47 Django has come along there.

00:51:48 So if people were out there listening and their favorite framework wasn't listed in one

00:51:54 of those three or wasn't one of those three, PRs are accepted, I guess, and they could

00:51:59 integrate, you know, their, their favorite Sanic or whatever they're after.

00:52:03 Yeah, definitely.

00:52:03 Like any feedback's really appreciated.

00:52:05 So like the community has definitely helped me a lot with Piccolo, just, just as much as

00:52:09 trying it and giving feedback or, you know, obviously pull requests are also like really

00:52:13 valued.

00:52:13 Even if you just want to raise an issue to say, well, how did you do this?

00:52:16 Like, you know, that's still welcome.

00:52:19 Yeah.

00:52:19 Awesome.

00:52:20 Well, well, maybe that's a good place to talk about where things are going in the future

00:52:23 and kind of wrap up our conversation a bit.

00:52:26 Yeah.

00:52:26 So I feel like I'll never be bored with Piccolo because Postgres is continuously developing

00:52:31 and adding new features.

00:52:32 And I almost feel like Postgres is almost like an operating system in a way.

00:52:36 Like the amount it does is kind of insane.

00:52:38 So it even has like a PubSub built in.

00:52:41 You can do that.

00:52:41 Listen, notify.

00:52:42 Oh, wow.

00:52:43 I'd like to do post GIS support.

00:52:44 Timescale DBs are really up and coming extension as well for Postgres for time series data.

00:52:49 But then a lot of the stuff I'm excited about is like on the admin side.

00:52:54 So as I mentioned before, Piccolo admin effectively turns Pydantic models into UI.

00:53:00 So the next thing I want to add is you can basically give it arbitrary Pydantic models and it will

00:53:06 render them as forms in the admin.

00:53:08 So if you have, for example, you want to send an email, you'll just create send email model,

00:53:13 give it to Piccolo admin and it'll generate a form.

00:53:15 That's stuff I'm really excited about as well, just to increase the utility of Piccolo admin.

00:53:19 So a backend developer could build a functional app for a business without actually writing any code.

00:53:24 That's kind of the dream is to build like a really, really great admin.

00:53:27 Yeah.

00:53:28 Yeah.

00:53:28 These self-serve, like once you create the app and hand it off, how far can people go before they have to hire your design agency again or something like that?

00:53:38 The more that they can just run with it, the better, I suspect.

00:53:40 Yeah.

00:53:41 It's such a huge benefit from Django, like having that admin.

00:53:44 So I just want to kind of see what I can do with the latest technologies to build a really great one.

00:53:49 Yeah.

00:53:49 What's the story with Django and Piccolo?

00:53:52 Is there a reasonable way to click them together or is it really not so much so far?

00:53:57 I think you can.

00:53:58 I haven't really tried it much, but it's very configurable, Piccolo.

00:54:01 So, you know, and none of the names, they deliberately don't clash with Django.

00:54:04 So Django has a settings.py, Piccolo has a piccolo underscore conf.py.

00:54:09 And then Django has a migrations folder, but Piccolo has piccolo underscore migrations.

00:54:14 So there's no clash there.

00:54:16 So in theory, they would work together.

00:54:17 There's no like compatibility layer between the admins.

00:54:20 So you'd have like two separate admins or, but I'd like to add support for Django as it is an ASGII app

00:54:25 and it's the originator of the ASGII standard.

00:54:27 And I still think Django is one of the great kind of masterpieces in the framework world.

00:54:32 It's lasted so long and it's still such a rock solid choice.

00:54:35 I would like to see what I can do there.

00:54:38 Yeah.

00:54:38 The closer those could be, I think, right?

00:54:41 Like this having the genesis and so many similar ideas to Django, it seems like they should be somehow working together, which is great.

00:54:47 Yeah, that'd be cool.

00:54:48 All right.

00:54:48 Well, Dan, I think that might be about it for time that we got.

00:54:51 Let me ask you the final two questions that I always ask.

00:54:55 If you're going to write some code, you can work on Piccolo.

00:54:56 What editor to use?

00:54:58 I think I caught a hint of it earlier, but go ahead.

00:55:00 Yeah.

00:55:01 VS Code all the way.

00:55:02 I was a huge Sublime Text and TextMate user.

00:55:04 And I was like, I'll try out this VS Code, see what all the hype's about.

00:55:07 And after five minutes, I was never going back.

00:55:10 I just think it's such a great gift to the world from Microsoft.

00:55:13 It just gets better and better as well.

00:55:16 Yeah.

00:55:16 Love VS Code.

00:55:17 Right on.

00:55:17 And then notable PyPI package you want to give a shout out to?

00:55:21 So I'm going to cheat and pick two.

00:55:22 So Pydantic, because I think it's such a nice serialization library.

00:55:26 And I think it could almost be in the standard library.

00:55:28 It feels so Pyphonic and natural.

00:55:30 And then Starlet, because I think it's just a beautiful foundation for the ASCII world.

00:55:37 And I'd really encourage people to look at the code to see the power of ASCII, how it

00:55:41 is this like turtles all the way down.

00:55:43 Everything's ASCII.

00:55:44 It is quite interesting.

00:55:45 So those would be my two shout outs.

00:55:48 Yeah.

00:55:48 Very cool.

00:55:48 You know, FastAPI is so popular now, but FastAPI is kind of like an opinionated view on top of

00:55:53 Starlette to a large degree.

00:55:55 Yeah.

00:55:55 FastAPI is great as well.

00:55:57 Yeah.

00:55:57 Well, I mean, it takes the two things you said, Pydantic and Starlet, and puts them together

00:56:01 in like a nice way, which I think is pretty neat.

00:56:03 Yeah.

00:56:03 It's got great taste.

00:56:05 Yeah, for sure.

00:56:06 I'd just like to say one thing really quick, and just thanks to everyone who's contributed

00:56:09 to Piccolo, because there's been people who've been contributing for several years by this

00:56:13 point and have put a lot of work in.

00:56:15 So yeah, just a shout out to anyone in the Piccolo community.

00:56:17 Yeah.

00:56:18 And, you know, Final Call to Action, people are interested in using this.

00:56:22 It's good to go.

00:56:23 It's ready for production, web apps, and all that kind of stuff.

00:56:26 I didn't really want to promote it before it was ready.

00:56:28 And I use it in production.

00:56:29 I have done for years.

00:56:29 And I am quite conservative about pushing stuff out there, unless I think it's, you know, solid.

00:56:34 It's got 100 unit tests.

00:56:35 You know, it's solid.

00:56:37 I'm not saying there's not some edge case I haven't discovered yet in some version of,

00:56:42 you know, Postgres or something.

00:56:43 But I use it in production every single day.

00:56:45 Well, congrats on building a really cool Pythonic ORM.

00:56:49 I really like the way that you put things together.

00:56:51 And yeah, it looks great.

00:56:53 It's got a lot of nice modern Python features.

00:56:56 And people should definitely check it out.

00:56:57 Cool.

00:56:58 Yeah.

00:56:58 Thanks a lot, Michael.

00:56:59 Yeah.

00:56:59 You bet.

00:56:59 See you later.
