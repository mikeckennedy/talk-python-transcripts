How secure is your application? Do you know the main vulnerabilities that most apps suffer from?

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.920
How would you even start to answer these questions? On this episode of Talk Python to Me,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.480
Justin Seitz is here to tell us all about it. This is episode number 37, recorded December 2nd,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.420
2015. Now, before I play the theme music, I have a little something special for you guys.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.240
This week only, instead of developers, developers, developers, we have Secrets from the Future by

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.600
MC Frenolot. It's a great song about the futility of computer security over time. You can catch the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.280
entire song at the end of this episode.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:01:15.500

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.140
Thanks for listening today. Let me introduce Justin. Justin Seitz is a respected cybersecurity

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.520
expert who has trained and consulted with Fortune 500s, law enforcement agencies, and governments

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.080
around the world. He's the author of two Python books that were translated into seven languages.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.460
He's helped teach tens of thousands of people how to write code to automate computer hacking and OSINT

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.480
tasks. In October 2014, he presented a unique method for tracking ISIS supporters on Twitter.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.320
Justin, welcome to the show.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.040
Thank you very much for having me.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.900
Yeah, I'm pretty excited to talk about this whole world of computer security and breaking software and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.500
understanding where vulnerabilities are in your software. So I'm just happy you're on the show to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.100
talk about that.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.580
That's great. Normally you have builders and now you have a breaker. So that's awesome.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.980
Yeah, that's right. Normally we have the builders on here, but I think

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.140
it's super important to see that side of the story, right? Like if you build a website and you put it out

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.000
there, how do you know, you know, I kind of feel like it's safe. Is it safe? I don't know. Like you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.280
should understand, you know, what the people who are trying to break into your systems are,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.360
what, what, how would that even happen? Right. So that's, I think it's going to be really valuable

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.880
to builders in addition to everyone else.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.740
Cool.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.200
Cool. So we're going to talk a lot about that, but let's get started with where you got in a program in

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.160
Python. What's your story?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.220
So how I got programming in Python was a good buddy of mine, Dave Falloon. I'll never forget

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.240
him peering over my shoulder when we worked together at a startup at one point. And I was doing everything

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.880
in PHP. And, you know, he kind of said, you know, dude, it's really lame that you're using PHP to do

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.440
all this stuff. You should really look into Python. So I did. And, you know, I'm one of those old dogs,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.000
new tricks kind of guy. So I was like, oh man, you know, I'm not truth be told, not the strongest

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.840
developer. I had the pleasure of working in a couple of different companies with some really

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.160
top notch developers who just kind of blew my mind on a daily basis. And, you know, I knew that I was

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.520
never going to be like that. But I found with Python that I kind of went from zero to actually knowing

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.180
what I was doing awfully quick. And, and kind of around this time, as I was, you know, spending time

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.640
in kind of hacker forums and reverse engineering forums and stuff. You know, it was, it was kind

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.440
of strange, but Python seemed to almost become the de facto language for people to start using in the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.980
hacking community. So between Dave kind of goading me into learning it and kind of the hacking community

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.340
beginning to adopt it as really, as, as the language we were all going to kind of standardize ourselves

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.540
on for the most part, that's really what kickstarted my journey into a Python coding.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.760
I think that's the way a lot of people get started in Python is it's kind of the easy path to get

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.280
started, but unlike a lot of other easy paths, it doesn't seem to have a real strong upper pound,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.820
right? Like you can build rich, high end systems, but you can also get started easy. And that's,

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.740
that's kind of unique to this whole ecosystem, right?

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.020
Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, I've seen some of the most, you know, the craziest systems built

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.200
completely in pure Python. And I've seen some of the most beautifully simple scripts that do amazing

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.340
stuff that are, you know, 10 lines long, which is great because I think 10 years ago, there's always

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.860
the, the argument of, you know, performance and compiled languages versus things like .NET when it was kind

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.820
of going through its renaissance period. And now I think we're to the point where we're kind of like,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.980
you know, unless you're processing billions of transactions a second, which I bet you there are

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.380
Python installations out there that are doing that. We're okay. Everybody's kind of accepted that

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.440
there's many ways to skin these cats. And Python is just a great way to, to literally go from zero to

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.740
60 very, very quickly.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.360
Yeah, definitely agree. So that's kind of how you got into Python. That's, that's really interesting. But

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.220
you took a sort of different path, right? You got into sort of analyzing systems and checking them for

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.280
vulnerabilities and offensive security and all that kind of stuff. That's a pretty different path than,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.320
you know, I'm going to start building a websites in charge to build, you know, people's homepages or

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.700
whatever, right? Tell me the story there.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.460
Yeah, yeah, sure. So I actually did spend a period of time being a web developer, again, hence why I

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.700
was into PHP. But, you know, the big thing for me was that I was at this startup that was

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:09.740
amazingly good, had a fantastic engineering team that kind of looked at talent and said,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:17.140
you know, you are good at this particular job, do you want to do it? And for me, I got into quality

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:23.620
assurance and totally by accident. I was originally hired on there to, to fix printers, believe it or

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.980
not. But this was one of these really progressive kind of funky startups. And very quickly, I was leading

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.300
the QA team, which was very small. And soon, it turned out that I was really good at breaking

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.860
software. Now, I'd spent a number of years kind of in and out of, you know, kind of the hacking scene

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.920
and, you know, doing research on my own, but never really took it very seriously, never really took it

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.100
like something that it was, you know, that I wanted to do as a career. I didn't even know that it was

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.600
actually a career at the time. So as I got further and further along in this QA stuff, they realized that

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.460
we should actually get Justin spending all of his time breaking stuff. Because I seem to have this

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:08.300
kind of weird ability to find the bugs that nobody else would find. And to also, because I was into

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.680
reverse engineering, that I could assist the development staff in tracking down particularly

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:20.560
nasty bugs that they couldn't figure out other ways. So I basically, eventually became just a breaker.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.180
So they brought in someone to run the overall QA team, and I was able to step aside and just simply

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:32.920
focus on that. And around this time, probably in 2006, 2007, I became more and more active

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:40.660
on reverse engineering forums and started sharing code and kind of networking with people. It was around

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.020
this time that I also decided, hey, I think I actually want to write a book, because I was writing some

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:52.640
tools in Python specifically for reverse engineering. And then immunity, where I spent seven years, sponsored a

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:59.580
competition, I believe in 2007, that was writing a plugin for what was called immunity debugger, which is a

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:05.640
debugger specifically designed to, for reverse engineering, primarily geared towards exploit development.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:13.260
development. So I ended up writing a plugin for that, of course, in Python. And I won that competition. And shortly

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:20.500
thereafter, immunity hired me on in 2008. And from that point forward, I was doing all kinds of development

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:26.940
work. So their products were all written in Python. So I was working on penetration testing product there,

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.720
called Canvas, and also doing a lot of consulting and other work. And that's kind of what carried me down

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:43.020
that path. So I've been very fortunate that I've had a number of employers that kind of allowed me a bit

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.340
of free reign and allowed me to kind of chase the stuff that I found interesting. So I've been really

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.340
fortunate over the past 10 or 15 years to have that.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.320
It's really great when you get to pursue what you're super interested in, right? It's almost like

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.760
you get paid to be on vacation or to do your hobby or something, right?

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.620
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.800
Yeah, it's great. So you talked about your books. The first one you wrote was called

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.320
Grey Hat Python. Is that right?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.840
That's correct. Yeah.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.420
Yeah. So can you tell us kind of what topics you covered in there? And what's the story of that book?

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:20.420
So Grey Hat Python was definitely more heavily geared towards lower level reverse engineering and

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:26.840
exploit development and also looking at building tools to assist you in identifying vulnerabilities.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.980
So in the security world, a lot of us employ a technique called fuzzing, which just basically

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:38.980
means generating random or semi-random inputs for a piece of software to process. So if you think of

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:47.420
a traditional server written in C that kind of takes packets in and dissects this proprietary protocol,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:53.400
what we would do is we'd write fuzzers that would basically try to break how that protocol is parsed by that software

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.540
in the hopes that we would find vulnerabilities. So Grey Hat Python kind of takes you through

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:05.940
how to build some tools to assist on the back end, which means trapping bugs or using an automated kind of

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:13.080
debugging system to trap bugs, all the way up to building the fuzzers and building some of the other tools

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:19.480
to help you find bugs. So it was definitely more of a low level book, but it leveraged Python all the way

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.560
through to build tools to assist you.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.240
Oh, that's really cool. So is that like looking for buffer overflows and SQL injection attacks and things like

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.520
that or other stuff as well?

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:37.700
Yeah, exactly. So I mean, 10 years ago, and still somewhat today, but things have changed a bit.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.760
10 years ago, we were definitely looking for memory corruption bugs, which would be buffer overflows,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.500
heap overflows, and you know, there's a myriad of other bugs. But you're right, we also,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:53.780
most of us in the community that are writing tools, we're building stuff too, that's looking for SQL injection

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:59.940
bugs or looking for, you know, cross site scripting vulnerabilities. So much the same that we would be

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:05.300
focused on fuzzing software. We also built tools that would fuzz web applications as well.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:12.080
I suspect a lot of the listeners know what buffer overflows are and what SQL injection

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.700
vulnerabilities are. But maybe, you know, there's probably a decent number of people who don't.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.720
Could you maybe just talk about those two terms? Those are probably the two big,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.700
super bad problems you can introduce into your code, right?

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:30.880
Sure, sure. So a buffer overflow is really where you're kind of shoving more data into a spot in

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:37.020
memory than it can handle. So if you think of a string in memory that is, you know, we can treat

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:43.080
it like a bucket. So this bucket can hold a maximum of 50 letters, or if you wanted to treat it like water,

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.900
it could be 50 liters of water. So typically, what you want to do when you're a programmer and you're using

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:56.640
a language like C, is that you want to ensure that you can never have even 51 liters of water or 51 letters

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:05.300
in that bucket. So what happens in a buffer overflow situation is that we are able to literally kind of

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:12.080
overflow the bucket. And depending on how we overflow that bucket, we can actually then control how your

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:20.680
program executes from there. So it's a very common vulnerability. But some of it is definitely starting

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:26.940
to go away because things like Visual Studio, the tool chains are starting to build in protections

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:33.680
in an attempt to deal with those programming flaws. And they're also trying to prevent you from using

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:41.300
functions like stir copy or mem copy in unsafe ways. So we're starting to get away from it. But that's

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.760
kind of the general feeling or general explanation of how a buffer overflow looks.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:53.920
Now for a SQL injection vulnerability, we're not so much concerned with kind of shoveling too much data

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.540
in. But if you've ever written SQL code in like a PHP application, or even in Python,

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:05.080
and you concatenate strings together, for example, so you have your select statement, and you say,

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:12.060
where ID equals, then you have your quote, and you know, plus, and then some piece of input from the user.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:20.040
Now, what we can do is we can substitute in a quote or single quote, or potentially other characters that

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:27.460
can actually allow us to control how that SQL statement is executed. So by injecting our own SQL,

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.340
that means that we could potentially extract data, you know, maybe you're only doing a select against

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:38.080
the products database. But when we send in our injection code, if we're successful in getting it in,

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.120
potentially, we could then begin mapping out all of the tables in the database, or we could begin

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.480
extracting data, not from the products table, but from the users table, where we could grab

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:53.900
usernames and passwords. Or in some cases, you can even begin executing commands directly on the

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.040
operating system straight from that little SQL injection vulnerability.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.840
Yeah, and that might be like the text box for your password.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.440
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.280
That's the command line to the remote box, right? It's less good when it's used that way, I think.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.360
Yeah, that's right. And I think, you know, what it all boils down to is either just input

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:20.580
sanitization problems, right? So again, there's a lot of, you know, platforms are starting to get better,

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.940
and tool chains are getting better at forcing programmers to write code in a certain way.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.920
And then on top of it, you know, there are a number of frameworks that are trying to make it so that

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.400
these kind of class of vulnerabilities are going to go the way of the dodo.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.860
Yeah, that's really nice that the systems and the compilers are taking care of it, you know,

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.280
somewhat that helps, right? As well as the ORMs, right? So like SQLAlchemy,

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:54.260
or other high-level ORMs that don't accept string SQL, definitely help mitigate that some.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:15:00.400
Have you Googled or have you seen the XKCD exploits of a mom, little Bobby tables?

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.200
Oh, yes.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:08.520
For those of you who don't know what a SQL injection attack is, make sure you take the time to Google

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:13.740
for little Bobby tables and you'll get the XKCD exploits of a mom. I'll put it in the link of the

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.320
show notes, but I won't say any more. I'll let you check it out.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.620
That's great. Yeah, it's a lot of books.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.860
Did you really name your son that? Yes.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:30.420
So I mentioned the two vulnerabilities that are like well-known to me because I, you know,

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.800
take account for them when I write web apps and stuff. But what else is out there that are sort

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:41.220
of on that scale that we should be aware of as developers to like just know that we should make

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:47.040
sure we don't do that? Well, again, I think the big thing is, you know, paying attention to every

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:54.040
place that input comes in from a user and assume that every user is extremely evil. So a lot of people,

00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:00.820
you know, again, they're checking the SQL injection stuff. People treat it very seriously. So you,

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.520
along with a number of other developers, might be spending a lot of time taking a hard look at where

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.820
they interact with their database or using an ORM like SQLAlchemy. But there's a number of other

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:17.260
vulnerabilities like site scripting, which means that I'm able to pass in JavaScript to a piece of

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:22.680
input on your web application and have your web application kind of echo that JavaScript back out.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:29.640
Now, this is not as sexy as a SQL injection because I can't directly attack your server. But what it does

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:35.140
allow me to do is potentially social engineer users of your system or even you as the administrator of

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:40.960
the system to click on a link that includes some JavaScript in that link. When you visit the link,

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:47.640
because you're not filtering the input properly, my JavaScript that I've included in the URL gets executed

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:53.400
in the context of your browser. So now effectively, I have the ability to make your browser do stuff

00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:00.120
that you probably don't want me to do. You can pair this with other vulnerabilities as well. So that's,

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.720
you know, again, a common one is cross site scripting. Now, you know, again, these are all things that

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:11.200
if you Google for like the OWASP top 10, these are all things you're going to be looking for. But typically,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.160
in my experience as someone who spent a lot of time hacking into systems,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:21.400
a lot of our big wins where we were able to really compromise applications didn't necessarily involve

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:28.120
some of these classic attacks, it might be something as simple as not validating that a user account

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:34.380
should have access to a particular set of data. So if you and I both use the same system, and I'm user

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:41.240
ID one, and your user ID two, and there's a set of documents in this system, that you're assigned,

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:48.180
maybe the first 10 documents, and I'm assigned the last 10. What in a lot of cases, what we found was that, you know,

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:53.940
they're not properly checking and validating that I should only be allowed to access particular documents.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.300
So now I'm able to access all of the sensitive information that you are,

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:03.940
in some cases, just by incrementing one number by walking through all of the various document IDs.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:10.880
So is this an architectural flaw? Yes. Is it an input sanitization flaw, which are the most common or

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.720
previously most common? No. So it's a bit more nefarious, because you as a developer, as you're

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.080
paying attention to escaping all input and double checking your SQL queries and all that stuff,

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.860
some of these more architectural flaws are a little bit more subtle and a little bit more nefarious.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:34.580
Yeah. So interesting. So for example, if I've got a relational database with a primary key that's

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:41.300
an integer and auto incrementing for all of my resources in my web app, and I have a user account,

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:49.380
it's very likely I can enumerate, you know, all of that type of data. So I might be slash users slash 271.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:55.920
Well, it looks like I could just try a bunch of numbers between one and 10,000 and look for users and

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.620
see what I can see about them, right? Or documents or whatever, yeah?

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:04.460
Absolutely. And, you know, it sounds completely simple, but it's worked in a number of cases.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:13.500
So, you know, this is where, again, you know, things like using GUIDs, so very big, long,

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:19.860
unique numbers that are randomized, are really helpful, because then it becomes very difficult for me,

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:25.900
the attacker to begin enumerating GUIDs, because they're tremendously big, right? It's not just a

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:31.780
simple integer. So when you're passing information around a web app, you know, in your user ID one,

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:37.480
you should really reference that user by GUID that's really big and unique, because it makes it

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.060
tough for an attacker to do some of those enumeration techniques.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.080
Yeah, that's great advice.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:59.980

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.040
Okay, so what else was in the Grey Hat Python?

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:03.820
So that was basically, you know, we've kind of run the gamut for Grey Hat Python, and it was really

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.200
heavily focused on the reverse engineering and exploit writing stuff.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.500
So that sounds like it's focused on kind of the application level.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.960
That's right.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:20.280
There's the whole sort of infrastructure, the way apps are put together, you know, the network,

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.640
those types of things that maybe you didn't talk about in that book, right?

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.020
That's right. Yeah. So I didn't talk a whole lot about that in that book, but that's where

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:34.420
I decided to write a second book, which was Black Hat Python, which is a more traditional penetration

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:41.560
test view of writing tools. So getting people to write tools that interact on the network. So just

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.640
fundamentally understanding how you write a client and server in Python is actually going to help you

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:53.000
understand how to write tools to do network attacks. So I teach people how to do that. And then I also

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
teach them how to use some more powerful libraries in Python, like Scatty, that allows you to execute

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.260
more complex attacks and allows you to do things like pet sniffing, allows you to, you know, kind of

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:12.140
analyze some of the data you capture in tools like Wireshark. I also spend time teaching people how to

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:20.260
write tools to attack web applications. So whether that's unique kind of brute forcers or using something

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:26.340
like Burp Suite, which is a popular web application hacking tool that a lot of people use. So I teach you

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:33.080
how to write plugins for Burp Suite. And then later on in the book, I start to move into more and more

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:39.520
offensive techniques. So I teach people actually how to write a Trojan or a virus that leverages GitHub

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:46.120
for command and control. So that means that this virus doesn't actually communicate to you. It

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:52.160
communicates only to GitHub, which in most corporate environments will bypass all the firewalls,

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.480
because most corporate environments allow people to go to GitHub.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.360
Right. GitHub is fine. It's HTTP. It's outbound. How could that be wrong?

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.620
Exactly. Well, it's actually HTTPS, which is even better because then a lot of the

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:11.820
inline antivirus products are blind when it's an SSL connection. So they can't actually inspect any of

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:18.820
the traffic that's going by. So you have this HTTPS, this encrypted session to GitHub. And then

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:25.600
basically, you know, this Trojan is designed to retrieve its commands from GitHub. Also, it will do,

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:33.100
if the Trojan does not have a library, say like Win32, you can push that library to your GitHub repo,

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:39.120
and your Trojan will try to import it. And I actually hook into the import mechanism so that it reaches out

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.920
to GitHub for all of its imports that it can't resolve locally. So it'll retrieve them over the network and

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:49.380
import them that way. And then after it executes the task, like say, takes a screenshot of the target

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:56.280
system, it then actually re-uploads the results back to your GitHub repo. So techniques like that,

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:03.020
which I really wanted to show people that number one, writing these tools in Python is amazingly simple.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:08.060
And when you sit back and realize you just wrote a Trojan that bypasses pretty much every firewall and

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:17.560
antivirus product out there in like 100 lines of Python or less, it's pretty neat. But also as a way to

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:24.420
help people understand from the network perspective, how simple it is for attackers to write tools like

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:30.460
this and how we need to get better at detecting them. So I start to get more offensive there. And

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:36.880
then kind of the tail end of the book is where I teach people, which, you know, is happening more and

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:43.300
more commonly where attackers are managing to get into host systems that host a number of virtual machines.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:50.600
So I've seen people who are kind of paranoid, so they only will perform like their web browsing inside a

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:56.460
virtual machine, right? And so the last part of the book, I teach you how to use a forensics framework

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:05.140
called volatility. That's pure Python, how to use this forensics framework to actually analyze the RAM for a

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.520
running virtual machine and then inject code into it so that we can compromise the virtual machine,

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:16.440
which would allow us to then kind of climb inside it and see what the user is up to inside that machine.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:25.000
So it covers a kind of a wide sweeping range from the network to web applications to Trojans and

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.540
kind of offensive forensics. But it's also a very short book. So I give you the code, I give you the

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.240
explanation and the why as to what we're doing. And there's really no fluff outside of that. It's really

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.200
about developing that Python muscle memory.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:46.580
Yeah, so that has me a little scared to use my computer. But I think it was really interesting.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:52.560
Some of the stuff that you did in that book, I think it's really neat. Like, for example, you talk about

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:59.200
if you understand how to use raw sockets in Python, that will take you a really long ways, right?

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:07.460
Yep, absolutely. Yeah. And again, I mean, that module by learning how to use raw sockets. And for example,

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:14.400
learning how to take something that comes off a raw socket and turn it into an actual IP structure,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:19.340
like you would have done in C 20 years ago, you're learning a ton of great concepts, you're learning

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:24.860
about the network, you're learning about how to use C types to create structures in memory. And you're

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:29.160
learning about some of the more fundamental pieces of networking, which is how packets are

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:34.800
actually built from the ground up. And you're learning it in this really easy way, like it's

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:41.360
really accessible. It's not, it's not like C or C++, which I still don't understand why people write

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:41.940
code in it.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:47.540
Yeah, it's definitely accessible, right? Like a lot of the code samples are like 20 lines of Python.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:53.800
That's right. Yeah. And it's really, you know, again, I, I really want people to be able to write

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.420
it and then sit back and say, okay, what if I did this and just go out and start doing it? So give

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.980
them the, give them the fundamentals, give them the capability, but don't, you know, don't lead them

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:09.720
down the entire path. I really like people having a, I love it when people email me and say, yo, I took

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:16.100
the example in chapter three, and I did this with it. What do you think? That means that I, that I,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.420
that people appreciate that style of writing.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:26.540
Yeah. Yeah. That's really great. You talked a little bit about the malware type of stuff. You said

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:32.500
you had some experience actually taking Python to like understand some piece of malware. So like,

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:39.300
suppose I find some suspicious file on my program, on my computer, what, what can I do to understand

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.880
whether that's just some random binary or if it's a real problem?

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:48.200
So there's a, there's a number of tools and frameworks out there. And again, you know,

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:55.160
things like I mentioned previously, volatility is, is very quickly becoming one of the big tools that

00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:01.300
forensic and malware people use to examine what is a piece of malware doing to your machine and what

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:08.140
artifacts is it leaving behind? And what is it modifying inside the memory of your machine? Which is

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:14.860
really critical. but there's a number of other things that you can do. For example, a lot of most,

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:20.720
you know, most modern malware is looking at how to defend itself against you. So it doesn't particularly

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:27.160
want anybody to reverse engineer it. because then it prevents, you know, if it can guard itself,

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:33.160
then it prevents people from, developing defenses against it. So, a number of years ago,

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:38.660
actually myself and a guy by the name of Neil, the hippie killer, built a, built a framework

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:44.160
called Muffy, which was designed, it was a Python framework that ran inside of immunity debugger.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:50.780
And it was designed to actually, completely, remove the protections or a number of protections

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:56.160
that malware would have in place that would prevent you from analyzing it. So this is all an automated

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.880
and scriptable framework built on top of immunity debugger that, it would, for example,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:06.980
a lot of malware wants to know, am I being debugged? So am I currently being run under debugger?

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:12.500
And so our framework would actually, reach into the malware and begin to undo those checks.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:18.040
Um, and it had multiple ways of doing that. Another thing that malware will do, for example,

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:24.560
is that it will walk the list of running processes on the system, looking for antivirus products,

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:30.380
looking for, debugging products. and so what Muffy would do is again, it would go in there

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.860
and it'd basically, start removing things from the list or it could actually patch out

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:41.900
the malware's ability to check for those processes. So aside from, you know, some of those big ones,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:49.300
and again, primarily I'm, I didn't spend most of my career being a, malware analyst and I do some now.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:57.100
But the, the big thing to me was that, with all of these tools like debuggers and,

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:08.480
even things like Ida Pro having Python built in, it allows you to kind of, if you're, if you're seeing the same thing in malware sample after malware sample after malware sample,

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.820
instead of spending five hours undoing some protection every time you spend five hours,

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:20.300
once writing code to automatically do it for you. And then, you know, that's fixed for you kind of for,

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:25.260
for life. You can kind of deploy that code whenever you need it. And Python's wonderful for that.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:31.260
So you build up like a set of libraries that perform these functions, you know, take down the debugger defenses,

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:38.040
take down the antivirus protection and just chain them together and go after it, uncloak it. So then you can understand it. Yeah.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:45.840
Yeah, that's exactly it. And then there's, you know, there's other cases too, where you might be analyzing a piece of malware that implements some very simple,

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:55.680
like XOR encryption. and maybe it, you know, it's, it's got some special little routine that it does. so lots of times what we'll do is,

00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:03.700
you know, we're always dealing in assembly code. So we'll look at the assembly and, and say, okay, they have this decryption function here.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:09.180
that's got maybe 10 or 20 assembly instructions. It will actually convert that directly into Python.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:15.680
and we can then begin, you know, executing any string or any piece of data that comes across the network.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:22.280
we can begin actually processing it directly in Python rather than letting the malware have to run through the decryption routine itself.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:29.100
It's been a long time since I've had some kind of virus or malware that I know of on my, on any of my machines.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:39.360
But I, the last time I remember that I did have one, yeah, the way I found out was very bizarre. I had a, a firewall, like, oh my gosh,

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:45.160
what was it called? One of the original firewalls you could put on windows XP and it would have been like zone alarm.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.460
Yes. Thank you. Zone alarm. And I rebooted my computer at work and it said,

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:53.000
notepad wants to act as a server on your network. I thought, oh, that can't be good.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:01.340
I'm like, oh my God. And that looks weird. I go and run it and it looks like notepad, but you can bet it wasn't right.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.300
That's awesome.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.960
We went in and checked and a lot of our computers at this office were letting notepad run as a server.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.980
That was not good.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:17.080
So my question, my question was, you know, there were antivirus things we installed and they said,

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:23.640
oh, we removed the problem. If something like this happens, do you think it's ever safe to use your computer again?

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.720
Or does it just require like a format straight away?

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.560
I don't know. It's, you know, it's really tough to say, you know,

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:35.800
the amazing thing about the security community is that it always seems like every year we want to one up, ourselves.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.440
So, you know, it used to be that, yeah, you get an infection, just remove it.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.920
And then people are like, ah, no, you know, actually, they figured out how to persist, you know,

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.640
in the BIOS or whatever it is. you know, and then, and then it's like, okay, well, maybe let's,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.380
let's format. And it's like, oh, well, format actually doesn't solve the whole BIOS problem.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:57.080
Uh, okay. So maybe it's format and, and reflash the BIOS.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.740
And then guys started infecting the hard drive controllers.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.760
So they're actually on the chip that controls the hard drive. Well, how do you get rid of that?

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:10.560
Um, so it's one of those things that I think depending on the strain and when I say strain,

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:15.360
I mean, really what that means is that most antivirus products are looking at the hash of the file and

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.460
they're saying, Hey, this is bad. so if you get infected by a known kind of variant and,

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:25.700
and you have a good idea of, and in most cases you can just go read the report on what that particular,

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:30.180
you know, what that malware actually does. If there's never been evidence that that malware

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:37.100
actually downloads and installs a root kit or some other low level, tool, then I think,

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:43.880
yeah, a full kind of hard drive, format is going to do the trick for you. But in some cases,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:49.420
that's not going to be enough. you know, it's, it's, it's, it's one of those things.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:54.220
I don't remember the last time, I don't remember the last time I personally have been

00:33:54.220 --> 00:34:00.980
infected with something, but, I'm on OSX and one of my good friends, Russell Nolan just

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:07.360
did a, a, a great presentation on OSX malware and how he kind of hunted it using, kind of big

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:13.300
data sets and Python, oddly enough, using pandas. and so some of the stuff that, some of the stuff

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:18.260
that Russ, and you can check that out at the, it was at a conference called countermeasure.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:22.560
so you can check out his talk. The talks will be posted. it, you know, some of the stuff that,

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.920
that Russ was finding was, was pretty impressive, impressive stuff that, that they're writing for

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.700
OSX as well. Yeah. So what you're telling me is that even formatting the computer is not enough. I

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.360
need to smash it and buy a new one. Yeah, I would totally, totally smash it, throw it out in your

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:44.960
backyard, turn the hose on it and, you know, go, go buy a new one. Crazy. Make it as expensive as

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.240
possible for yourself. Cause then it'll totally make you like way more

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:54.100
vigilant in the future. The next time I'm definitely not opening that, that document

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.860
with the cat videos. Yeah, that was from me.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:54.760
So another thing that you're into is something that you said was called open source intelligence. And

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.320
I'm guessing this is not like GPL licensed intelligence.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:06.000
No, that's right. So open source intelligence is kind of like, it's a general term for gathering

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.880
information from open sources. So non-classified sources, not involving, you know, spies on the ground

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:21.100
and not involving satellites in space. But what can we gather from sources like the news, social media,

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:28.940
even things like mobile applications? What kind of intelligence can we gather in general? So that's kind of

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.820
something that in the security community, you use it all the time, because when you're modeling

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:40.660
a particular target for a penetration test, you want to learn everything there is to know about that target.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:47.800
And especially when it comes to social engineering and phishing attacks, being able to perform open source

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:53.240
intelligence, for example, if I wanted to attack you, I would want to figure out where's your Facebook page?

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:58.480
Where's your Twitter page? What do you have on LinkedIn? Can I find out information about your hobbies,

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.820
your kids, all this stuff? And basically, I'm going to model you as a target.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:09.620
And I'm going to watch for things that seem to kind of emotionally register with you, so that when I write

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:16.360
you an email, or I send you a Twitter direct message, or, you know, I'm communicating with you in some way

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:21.720
that includes a link, meaning I want you to click on this link, that I'm communicating to you in a way that

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:27.760
you are going to definitely click on that link. So open source intelligence plays a huge,

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.280
a huge role in that, among other areas.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:35.340
Sure. So make it feel familiar. And then you're much more likely to get that first step into the

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.320
whole social side of things, right?

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:44.120
Yeah, that's right. I mean, and that's the specific use case for OSINT for the security community. But

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:49.320
it's really used in a whole bunch of other ways. You know, if there's a riot in a city,

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:55.840
police forces are using OSINT to take a look at what's going on, what are they talking about? Are there

00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:02.160
people gathering in a particular location? Same thing when we had the Paris attacks here a couple

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:07.880
of weeks ago? You know, a lot of it is open source information, you can go to bellingcat.com, for

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:13.200
example, and they have like a detailed analysis on, on one of the Paris attackers and the information

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:18.520
they found out about him only through open source means, for example. So it's kind of this amazing

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.580
hammer that you can hit many different nails with.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:27.740
Interesting. And speaking of nails, you said you'd actually use this technique to find extremist

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:28.380
supporters.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.460
On Twitter? Yes, that's right.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.900
Yeah, yeah, on Twitter, right.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:37.360
So last year I did a presentation at a conference where I used Python, because again, I can't really

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.940
program in much else, to be honest.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.700
So I used Python to base.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.260
Why would you want to?

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:49.440
Yeah, why would you want to, right? What I did was, I was looking at how to, how to identify

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:56.740
ISIS supporters on, on Twitter. And so this, this was kind of before, you know, I'd been

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:02.340
doing some of this stuff and some of this research on the side for a number of years, probably long

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:08.020
before it was kind of vogue. There's lots of people doing it now. But basically, I was, I was kind of,

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:12.940
the question I had was, well, how do I do this when I can't speak or read Arabic, right?

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:19.220
This is a big deal, because as you know, this is a terrorist group that has people from all walks

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:25.080
of life, speak all kinds of different languages. Text analysis has always kind of seemed like been,

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.600
you know, and sentiment analysis to go with it. Like, that's kind of the sexy thing people do

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:35.960
when they're analyzing Twitter networks. And for me, what I did instead was, I said, well, you know

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:41.400
what, actually, I think images are the way to go, because images don't require language, right?

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:46.500
So what I set out to do is use Python, along with OpenCV, which is a computer vision platform

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:53.300
with Python bindings. And I built a classifier that would detect that black flag of ISIS.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:40:00.960
So it was quite common for people who supported ISIS or were actually part of the group to use that black

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:08.660
flag in their profile picture on Twitter, or to use it in imagery, like propaganda videos, for example.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:15.540
Not uncommon when you have a video of, you know, some Syrian army tank blowing up that you see the black

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:21.160
flag in the top right-hand corner of the video. So this classifier's job was just to find that black flag.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:28.720
So then on top of it, I wrote Python to interact with the Twitter API. So what this thing would do is

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.520
basically, I would just point it anywhere. And part of it as well was asking the question of, like,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:39.640
the six degrees of Kevin Bacon. So I wanted to know how far away the nearest terrorist was in my social

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:45.900
network. So I literally just pointed this tool at my Twitter account. And it just basically ripped

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:50.080
through all of my friends and followers looking for the black flag. And then it went through all of

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.260
their friends and followers. And then as you can see, this kind of grows out exponentially until it

00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:01.120
started finding, started finding that black flag in propaganda or in profile pictures.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:07.340
And so actually, this worked really well for me, because in a very short period of time, I was able to

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:11.000
build up a database of two or 3000 extremist accounts.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.120
Now, the trick was that this was actually semi-automatically, because if you've ever used

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:25.800
OpenCV before to do kind of image detection or this kind of logo detection stuff, if you're not a

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:32.060
computer vision expert, which I definitely am not, you're going to run into kind of this high rate

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:36.860
of false positives. So there were cases where it would pick up a black cat and say, hey, that's

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.060
a nice supporter.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.460
It could have been an evil cat. You never know.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:45.820
It could have totally been an evil cat. So what I did was I actually used Python to solve the

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:51.140
semi-automatic problem, too. So after it was done crawling everything, let's say it had, you know,

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:56.400
a few thousand images and there was, you know, maybe a few hundred that might be kind of garbage.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:01.460
So what I wanted to do is to filter through them very quickly by hand.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:08.300
So I used WX Python and I wrote a little game. And all this game did was I would pull in all of the

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.600
images from this directory where I stored them. And then I could hit space bar if it was an ISA

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.680
supporter and enter if it was not. So very quickly, I could cycle through all the images very quickly,

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:21.180
kind of playing Duck, Duck, Goose. And amazingly enough, you know, it sounds like a lot like where

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.060
you're like, oh, man, like you did that with thousands of images. And I'm like, yeah, but it took like 10 minutes

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:31.080
because you very quickly, you know, it becomes this very quick game that you play and it is very,

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:36.800
very fast to cycle through all of them. So I use Python to kind of help me deal with that. Now,

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.920
you know, any computer vision experts who are listening to this, they already have like their

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:46.540
head in their hands like, oh, man, I can't believe you did that. But it worked for me. It was fast.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:54.340
And then, you know, kind of on top of that, the tail end of my presentation is really about how,

00:42:54.340 --> 00:43:01.220
again, using Python to push all of this data into Elasticsearch. And then just, you know,

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:06.480
because it's the Elasticsearch bindings for Python are beautiful. It's like one line of code,

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:11.440
you can take a dictionary and shovel it into a database. You know, like that is, for those of

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:17.760
us who've been around the block long enough, that was one of the most eye-opening, amazing thing I'd

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:23.880
ever seen. Like, you import this thing and you do es.index and like literally you're done.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.720
There's no schema design. There's nothing else you had to do. So I thought it was just

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:34.020
amazingly wonderful when I discovered Elasticsearch. And so it was actually a friend of mine,

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:38.200
Chris Gashler, who had said, you've got to check out Elasticsearch. It's totally easy to get data

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:44.440
into, not so easy to get data out of, which was totally true. But then I was able to do some

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:48.680
interesting stuff where I could look at, you know, the geotagging of tweets and I could see where there were

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:53.760
concentrations of supporters and I could begin to do analysis like, hey, what was the most popular

00:43:53.760 --> 00:44:00.540
cell phone they used to tweet with, for example. So it was really, it was a great use of Python

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.760
and open source intelligence. And it was, you know, it was really well received.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:10.060
Yeah. It sounds really, really interesting. I'm sure it was. What was the number,

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.800
your index, like your Kevin Bacon number?

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.440
It was really low.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:14.960
I'm sure.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:21.660
It was like, it was like three, I believe. Three or less than three. Now I actually, but that's,

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:26.260
it was kind of a biased sample because I follow a number of counterterrorism researchers and a number

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.980
of terrorists like to follow counterterrorism researchers so they know what they're saying,

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:31.220
right?

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:34.380
Of course, of course. It's a little self-selecting, but still, right?

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:40.060
It was, but it's actually, it was shocking because I did pick other accounts and it was very,

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.680
I didn't know what the answer was going to be, which is always the exciting thing about research

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:49.040
when you actually set out to, when you truly have no idea what the answer is going to be.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:56.480
But it was very low. It was always like three or sub three anywhere I ran it. So that was kind of,

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.200
that was kind of interesting to me.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.100
That is interesting. It doesn't really surprise me, but yeah, it doesn't make you feel warm and fuzzy

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:03.840
either, I suppose.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.760
No, not really. No, it's true.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:14.440
So you have a, a cool course on a sort of automating open source intelligence and kind of

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.700
taking people through a lot of the techniques that you were kind of employing there, right?

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.820
Yeah, yeah, I do. So, I run a course at automatingosync.com. I have a blog as well

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:28.680
where I'm teaching people how to use Python, and, and like just a hint of JavaScript when required,

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:35.300
I know, but, I'm teaching them how to, you know, automate the collection of tweets. How do we

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:41.040
find all the friends and followers for an account? And then how do we do, you know, Instagram and

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:47.900
YouTube and thinking about how people, journalists, law enforcement, data scientists are approaching

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:53.340
some of these data sets and then boiling that down into very kind of digestible kind of small,

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:58.320
uh, lessons that people can take, so that they can learn how to do some of this stuff.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.540
Because again, whether you're a marketer or you're someone who's a counterterrorism analyst,

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:09.100
um, the same data can have very quite, you know, looking at it through different lenses, is

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:14.040
really, really fascinating. So that's kind of the whole, purpose of the course is to just teach

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:19.360
people how, how to do some of this stuff, how to use Python. And, and honestly, some of it is me

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:24.340
teaching them, you know, here's how you debug a Python script and here's, you know, don't be afraid

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:29.080
of coding, that this is really not that scary. And, and you can, you know, literally I've taken

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.320
people who've never written a line of code in their life and they're sending me screenshots of,

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:38.540
uh, of Cabana loaded up with, tweets in an elastic search instance. And they're like,

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:42.980
yo dude, check this out. Like I can, I can tell that you tweet way more on Wednesdays. And I'm like,

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:48.020
that's really creepy and awesome at the same time. But, you know, stuff like that, that,

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:52.480
that this is a, it's just, I have a real passion for open source intelligence stuff,

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.820
uh, and for Python. And so it was just natural for me that I'm like, you know what? I have like,

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:04.160
I don't know, hundreds of scripts that I've written. just like just one offers and stuff

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:09.520
I did to support research that I was doing that had nothing to do with my day job. And I'm like,

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.620
you know, I should start transferring some of this knowledge to other people because I think it would

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:20.040
be useful. So it is, it's totally amazing. I have people who are using it to, track criminals.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:27.680
I have people who are using it to collect information on war crimes in Syria. I have students who are,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.060
who are protecting some of the, working on protecting some of the largest, most well-known

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:38.000
household company names that we all use their products. you know, and they're, they're using

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.920
it to protect their infrastructure and, and find out if hackers are talking about them online. And,

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.900
uh, so it's really, it's an amazing field for sure.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:51.600
Yeah, it's really cool. And that's a, like a asynchronous type course, right? So you sign up and

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.120
you can take it from anywhere online more or less, right?

00:47:54.120 --> 00:48:00.760
Yeah, that's right. And it's just driven by videos and, and then written material and code samples.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.600
And then you have a skill testers where I get you to go out and solve problems with Python.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:11.360
Uh, then you have to submit them to me for grading. and then once a month I run, I run student

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:16.060
sessions where I hop online with, whatever students can make it. I hop online for an hour

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:20.520
and I field questions. And then I usually try to teach something that is not in the course. So,

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:27.240
uh, last month actually I taught people, how to connect Python to the Tor network so that

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:31.160
you can actually scrape, web pages inside of Tor, for example.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:35.440
Oh yeah, that's really cool. Yeah. I'll be sure to put a link to your course in the show notes.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.680
Awesome. Thank you.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:41.400
Yeah, you bet. So we have time for a few more questions. Let's see. So

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:41.840
sure.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.760
He must've, you know, over the years seen a lot of crazy stuff. What's the,

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:50.940
the most unusual or entertaining thing that you've kind of run across in this whole space?

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:54.360
Oh man, that's a, that is a very good question. So I think,

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:59.640
you know, I saw when I was doing some of this ISIS, research, I found a Twitter account,

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.380
uh, who actually showed up initially as an extremist. And then I found, he was actually,

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:10.260
uh, a satirist. but he would literally write some of the most like convincing kind of

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:15.640
tweets and, and he would take, for example, images that, that ISIS would use to kind of instill

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:20.400
fear and then he'd make them like hilarious. Right. And so I found this account and, and,

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.240
and as I'm reading through it, there's like these, you know, these jihadis who are

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.700
not very happy with him. They're like trying to get him kicked off of Twitter, but Twitter

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:33.400
won't really kick him off. And they're like, you know, threatening him and he's kind of responding

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:38.600
back with like pictures of goats and other stuff, you know? so I thought it was great. Like

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:43.180
I thought this is this, this person, number one's got guts and number two is like completely

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:48.100
counteracting, their message. I mean, nobody was really paying attention to his account,

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:51.660
which is unfortunate. I think if we had more people paying attention to that guy's account,

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:56.200
than we did paying attention to the ISIS guys, we'd be winning. but it was really

00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.980
hilarious because, this guy was like a never ending source of entertainment for me that

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:05.900
I could go back and check on him. Yeah. It seems like a really nice brush of fresh air with all

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:10.980
that sort of, you know, negativity out there to just turn it around and like, here, let me put

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:15.980
a cat picture on top of your tank or something. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It was pretty funny.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:22.180
Yeah. How funny. One thing I wanted to ask you about, because as a programmer, I have one view of

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:26.960
the world and I, you know, run a lot of non-programmers. So I see their view, but from a

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:31.360
computer security type person, you may have a different perspective and that's sort of like

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:35.940
computer hacking in sort of cybersecurity in the popular media.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.160
Right. Yeah. You're already laughing.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:45.640
Yeah. I'm just thinking of, you know, some quote, like I'm going to write a VB script that's going

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.440
to track down the IP address. What are you even saying? Right.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.900
Well, I mean, that's the thing, right? Is I think that, you know, you look at the original

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:59.600
kind of hackers movie, you know, sneakers was probably more realistic than people give it

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:05.640
credit for more so than a lot of other stuff. For the most part, like in popular media, it's,

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:12.060
it's pretty much 99% of it is garbage. And then within the last year we had the Mr. Robot series

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:19.040
come out, which was a complete game changer. And, you know, it's, they, they really fundamentally

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:26.200
get what it's about. And part of that is actually, they have a guy on their staff. His name is Michael

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:31.040
Pazell. He's a very popular guy in the open source intelligence world. And he's kind of the main

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:37.600
technical guy behind it. So he's the one who's driving a lot of the kind of technical and hacky

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:43.100
type stuff. And I can personally attest that, you know, Michael is a very smart guy. He knows what

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:48.760
he's talking about. And so this is the whole key to me is that having someone like that who is like,

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:54.800
you know what, we're not going to put a bunch of BS with like 3d cubes and, you know, whatever

00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:00.160
people hacking on touch screens and like whatever virtual reality, because that's not how hackers

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:06.800
work, right? It's like mundane. And it's through the terminals, you know, for the most part. So I think

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:14.500
that finally that for me was I, I was like, Oh, finally, somebody is actually covering this properly.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:20.220
But I can tell you that most hackers, you would not want to look over the shoulder while they work,

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:28.280
because it really is like, it is mind numbingly mundane stuff picking through 1000s of lines of

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:35.000
code looking for a bug. You can do that for two weeks before you hit that one place in the code that

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.860
you know, Oh, man, right there is exactly what I'm looking for. And then it gets exciting. But it can

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:47.580
totally be the most mundane work ever. And you know, that's just not good TV.

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:53.980
No, it's not. I think you're totally right about Mr. Robot. I love that series. I think I have just

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:59.420
the final episode to watch still. And I'll put the trailer in the show notes so people can check it out.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:05.780
But you know, I started watching that I saw, you know, they're talking about tour VPNs, there's Linux,

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:11.280
there's the command line, they the previous show, I just had the PyCharm guys on there. There's like

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.160
segments of the show where they're working in PyCharm. Like this is a really good show. It's,

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:20.600
it's obviously fiction. And it's on the outer edge of, you know, believable fiction. But at the same

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:26.660
time, it's not based in like funky 3d cubes that like mean nothing, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah,

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:33.000
yeah. Very cool. Very cool. One other quick question in this sort of non fictional space,

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.880
but kind of popular culture. There have been, it seems like increasingly many security breaches,

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:46.780
you know, Target, Home Depot, just, you know, one after another. Are things becoming less secure,

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:51.820
more secure? What are your what's your like general feeling when you're out on the internet? Fear or

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:52.980
generally? Okay.

00:53:54.020 --> 00:54:01.460
I mean, I'm Yeah, I really don't. I'm not that I'm not full of fear. That's for sure. But I used to joke

00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:07.060
when I when I'd have to do, like press interviews for like, okay, you know, it's December, actually,

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:11.040
this time of year, it'd be perfect, because they would they would call us up and say, what's your

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:16.340
predictions for 2016? Right? And I would say, whatever happened in 2015, it's going to just happen

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:21.840
again, maybe bigger, maybe smaller. So just copy out whatever I told you last year and just use it

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:27.840
again. And sadly, that's really where we're at, right? Like whether it's Target, whether it's Ashley

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:35.120
Madison, whatever it is, securing your data is an incredibly difficult thing to do. And so for me,

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:40.560
I was always breaking stuff, not necessarily fixing or defending stuff. And the defenders have an

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:46.240
incredibly difficult job. So for me, I don't think things are getting better or worse. I think

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:51.060
there are parts of the underlying security infrastructure that are getting better. I think

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:56.340
there are parts of the philosophy of security that are getting worse. Bring your own device,

00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:02.920
for example, BYOD is one of the perfect examples of the worst idea ever, never, ever let anybody do it.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:07.420
But people are still doing it. Oh, you want to bring your laptop from from home in and connect it to

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:12.780
the corporate network? You know, what's the worst that could happen? So to me, it's like there's these

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:16.220
opposing forces at times where we're getting better on the technology front,

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:23.180
I think. But the philosophy front, I think we have a ways to go. But again, it's it's very tough. I mean,

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:30.860
the the there's going to be no shortages of breaches and and database dumps in 2016, like we saw in 2015.

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.040
I don't think that's going to change.

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:35.040
Yeah, that's a really, really great answer. Thanks.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:43.000
I have two questions before you before you get out of here. And the first one is if you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you open up?

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.040
Hands down,

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:50.960
I have been using it for I don't even know how many years, a long time.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:56:11.560
All of my students, when you sign up for one of my courses, you get wing IDE pro as part of the course. I standardize all of my videos on it. Everything I do is in wing. And anytime someone asks me, you know, what should I use? 100% wing. The big thing for me is that the debugging capabilities are just out of this world. Love it.

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:39.960
They have a great team there. They have an accessible support staff. I don't even remember actually last time I had to file a ticket with them. So I yeah, hands down, it's weighing that being said, I know you had the PyCharm guys on here. People speak very highly of PyCharm. But for me, the inertia to try a different IDE when I need to be really productive every day. It's just too much for me to to have to even try to give it a fair shake. But I hear lots of good stuff about it.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:53.020
I've used wing a little bit, not a lot, but I'm, I'm definitely a fan of the IDE side of the story. So yeah, I'd like to hear that. Cool. Final question. What's your favorite PI PI package or library out there?

00:56:53.020 --> 00:57:09.900
Oh, man. Okay. I mean, requests is probably the one I use the most, which is just awesome. But the other day, I found a library called date util. And maybe the entire internet knows about date util already. But date util allows you to just like feed it.

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:28.060
Any kind of date string, like in any format. And it basically gives you back a date time object, which is amazing. You don't have to use format strings. You don't have to use any crazy, you know, conversions or string splitting to clean it up. It just does it.

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:39.340
That's awesome. Yeah, I hate working with dates, like in pretty much any language. It's always seems to be painful. And so that sounds really cool. I'm gonna check it out. Date util. Okay, date util. Get it. It's awesome.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:50.040
All right. I'm definitely gonna check it out. Justin, this has been a fascinating look inside of a world that most of us don't really look at that often. So thank you for sharing the story.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.740
Hey, thank you very much for having me on. This is this has been great.

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:59.980
Yep, you bet. And I'll make sure all the cool stuff we talked about in the show notes. So talk to you later. Thanks again.

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:01.200

This week's theme music was Secrets from the Future by MC Frontalot.

00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:00.160
He has at least four excellent albums in this genre that he created called Nerdcore.

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.480
Check him out at Frontalot.com.

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.920
His song Zero Day is also a perfect match for this episode.

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.720
So, thanks for listening.

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.940
Here's the full song, Secrets from the Future.

00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.520
Enjoy and I'll see you next time.

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:11.520
See you next time.

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:20.780
Get your most closely kept personal thought.

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.720
Put it in the word block with a password lock.

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:30.280
Stock it deep in the raw with extraction precluded by the ludicrous length and the strength of a reputed live.

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.460
Dictionary attack.

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.000
Proof string of characters.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.840
This imperative to what?

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.760
All that is leverages of privacy.

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:38.640
The NSA and homeliness.

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:41.800
You better PGP the raw because so far they ain't impressed.

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.580
You better take the PGP and print the hex of it out.

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.300
Scan that into a tiff.

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:50.980
Then if you secret doubt for your data, scramble up the order of the pixels.

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.640
We're the one time pad that describes the fun time had.

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:57.740
But the thick soul boot wearing stomper who dance to produce random clap trap.

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:01.360
All the intervals in between which set in tandem with the stomps themselves.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.220
Be got a seed of math unguessable.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.020
Ain't no complaint about the cipher that's redressable.

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.360
Best of all your secret.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.040
Nothing extant could extract it.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.080
By 2025 a children speak and spell could crack it.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.440
You can't hide secrets from the future with math.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:21.440
You can try but I bet that in the future they laugh at the half-fast schemes and algorithms amassed.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.880
Doing voice cryptographs in the past.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.420
You can't hide secrets from the future with math.

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:33.400
You can try but I bet that in the future they laugh at the half-fast schemes and algorithms amassed.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.900
To enforce cryptographs in the past.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.960
And future people do not give a damn about your shopping.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.500
Your visa number SSL to cherry popping hot grandpa action.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.900
Websites that you visit or pass were protected partitions.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:50.420
No matter how illicit and this it would seem is your saving grace.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:54.240
Like amazing haste of people to forget your name, your face.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.960
Lit in this list of indefensible indiscretions.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.040
In fact the only way that you could pray to make impression on the era ahead.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:06.000
Is if instead of being notable you make the data describing you undecodable.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.140
The script kid is sifting in that relic.

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.600
Called the internet seeking latches on treasure chests.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.260
If they could reckon seconds would it.

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.080
And yet get a chance to queue up for disassembly.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.120
To discover and crack the cover like a crumbrelate.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.940
They'll glance you over I guess.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.860
And then for a bare moment you persist.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:22.640
You exist.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.240
Almost seem like you're there don't it?

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:24.900
But you're not.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.480
You're here.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.080
Your name will fade as front's will.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:27.920
That's in the future.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.720
They don't know our crypt to bury it.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.120
And still.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.780
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.460
With math.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:34.180
You can try.

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.460
But I bet that in the future they laugh.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:37.920
At the half fast schemes.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.440
And algorithms amassed.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.860
You'll enforce cryptographs in the past.

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.760
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.460
With math.

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.160
You can try.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.460
But I bet that in the future they laugh.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.960
With the half fast schemes.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.400
And now the rhythms amassed.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.900
To enforce cryptographs in the past.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:58.160
Now it's an enigma machine.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.140
A code yelled out at hot bongs.

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:02.020
Into a tin can with a thin string.

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.540
And that ain't all you do.

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:06.100
To broadcast clear text of your intention.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.420
Send an email to the government.

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.000
Pledging your abstention from vote fraud.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:10.620
This time.

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:11.440
Next time.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.200
You ain't promised.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.240
You don't get a visit from the department of piranets.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:15.980
Be honest.

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.100
You ain't hacking those.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.160
It'd be too easy.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.420
Setting up the next president.

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:21.180
Pretending that you were through freezing.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.580
When you're nothing but warming up.

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.960
To do list in your diary.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.280
Better keep for a long time.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.100
In the long time.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:26.940
Better be tiring.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.900
Into the distribution of electrical brains.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:32.820
That's a guessing every unsalted hash that ever came.

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.400
They got alien technology.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.460
To make the rainbow tables.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.800
With an in an afternoon.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.100
A glance and have them secrets.

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.820
Don't resist the loving codes.

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.980
Of the mathematical calculation.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.200
Heart of your mystery.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.220
Sent free fall into palpitation.

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.140
Pump your tunnel rise up in the dump.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.200
A free agent.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.280
Nobody knows the future.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.460
Now go find out.

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.220
Be patient.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:59.800
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.220
With a favorite tribe.

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:02.800
And I bet that in the future.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.960
They don't have bad schemes.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.020
And I won't be honest.

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.980
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:11.780
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:38.160
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:41.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:41.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:41.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:42.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.120
You can't hide secrets from the future.
