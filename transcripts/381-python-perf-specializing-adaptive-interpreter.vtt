00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.260
We're on the edge of a major jump in Python performance.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.660
With the work done by the FasterCpython team and Python 3.11 due out in around a month,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.440
your existing Python code might see an increase of well over 25% in speed with no changes to your code.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.600
One of the main reasons is its new specializing adaptive interpreter.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.960
This episode is about that new feature and a great tool called Specialist,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.140
which lets you visualize how Python is speeding up your code and where it can't unless you make minor changes.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.380
Its creator, Brant Booker, is here to tell us all about it.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.320

Brant, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.200
Thank you for having me.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.760
I'm excited to talk about some of this stuff.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.200
I am absolutely excited about it as well.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.020
I feel there's a huge renaissance coming, happening right now,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.380
or has been happening for a little while now around Python performance.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.600
It's exciting to see, especially in just the last couple of years,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.180
that you definitely see these different focuses,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.020
whether it's, you know, improving single-threaded Python performance,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.180
multi-threaded Python performance, you know, Python in the browser.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.320
There's a lot of really cool stuff happening, right?

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.680
Yeah.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.040
Oh, if we could talk WebAssembly and PyScript and all that,

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.220
that is a very exciting thing.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.460
There's probably some performance side around it,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.040
maybe something we could touch on,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.760
but that's not the main topic for today.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.980
We're going to talk about just the core CPython

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.280
and how it works, which is going to be awesome.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.580
Some work you've done with the team there at Microsoft

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.020
and your contributions there.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.900
Before we get into all that stuff, though,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.180
let's start with your story.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.500
How did you get into programming in Python?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.960
Yeah.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.140
So I originally studied computer engineering,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.880
so like hardware stuff at UC Irvine.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.540
Around my, like, third or fourth year, so like 2017,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.160
I encountered Python really for the first time

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.520
in like a project setting.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.440
Basically, it was a senior design project.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.160
We get to kind of make whatever we want.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.280
So we made this cool system that basically it's point cameras

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.420
at a blackjack table and it's X card counters.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.920
And if you want to do something like that in, you know,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.480
four months or whatever, Python is kind of the way to go.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.680
Yeah, the CV stuff there is really good, right?

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.160
Yeah.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.500
So it was NumPy and OpenCV,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.600
and that was kind of my first exposure to this stuff.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.040
And so I learned that I like developing software

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.880
a lot more than developing hardware.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.040
So I kind of never looked back and just went full in.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.300
About a year later, so like 2018,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.200
I opened my first PR to the CPython Red Belt,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.480
and it was merged.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.920
And you're up to that.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.500
What was that PR?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.780
Oh, there's this standard library module

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.980
called Module Finder.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.100
Basically, it's one of those ones

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.060
that's kind of just a historical oddity,

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.300
and it's still in there.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.360
Basically, you can run it over any Python script.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.500
It detects all the imports,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.300
and so you can use it to build an import graph.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.380
And I forget exactly what I was using it for.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.240
I think it was for work.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.460
And I ran into some bugs that had been just kind of lingering there for years.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.240
And so I, you know,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.740
submitted patches for a bunch of them.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.700
And so that was kind of my first experience contributing to open source in general.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.240
That PR was actually open for a while.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.040
It was open for like, I think it was like a month or two or something like that.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.660
So in the meantime, I contributed other things to like my Pi type shed,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.080
but that's still my first open source contribution.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.300
It counts the day it was open.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.700
Yeah, it counts as a beginning or the end of the PR, right?

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.600
Yeah, exactly.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.540
Because those can be very different things sometimes.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.560
They can be very different.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.340
You know, we have now in CPython,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.320
we have the, just in Python, I guess,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.800
we have the developer in residence with Lucas Schlinger.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.660
He's there to sort of facilitate making that a lot faster.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.020
And I feel like people's experience there might be picking up speed and improving.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.640
Yeah, no, I think that's a great thing.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.760
And in general, just seeing this kind of shift towards full-time Python core development,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.080
you know, being funded by these big companies is really exciting to see.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.200
I think it improves the end contributor experience, the user experience,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.440
and just gets things done, which is nice.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.980
I don't have any numbers, but I imagine there are fewer of those kind of lingering,

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.560
you know, months old PRs than there were back when I first started.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.000
Yeah.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.100
Way, way long ago, four years ago.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.800
So far back in the past.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.120
So long, so long, yeah.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.380
So yeah, so that was like 2018, 2019,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.860
I became a member of the triage team,

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.280
which is basically a team for people who are kind of more involved in Python

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.380
than just your average drive-by contributor.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.880
So while they're not full core developers,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.180
they basically can do anything a core developer can,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.960
except vote and actually, you know, press the merge button.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.880
So that was really nice because it made doing things like reviewing PRs easier.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.000
Tagging issues, closing issues, that sort of thing.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
A year later, I became a core developer.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.240
How did you get the experience for that?

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.080
Like, how do you, you know, it's one thing to say,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.780
well, I've focused on this module and here's this fix.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.280
And it's another to say, you know, give me anything from CPython and I'll assess it.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.300
Well, it wasn't give me anything from CPython.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.820
And it was, you know, made it part of my morning routine to, you know, wake up,

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.200
go to a coffee shop, order a coffee, and just for a half hour, look at newly opened issues.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.640
And for newly opened PRs.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.860
Yeah.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.340
Yeah.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.460
Well, I focus mostly on PR review for new contributors.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.680
Basically, I had filters set up that said, you know, show me all the PRs open the last 48 hours from a new contributor.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.440
I thought, okay, my first contribution experience wasn't that great.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.220
It'd be great if these people who have never opened a PR to CPython before can get a response within 48 hours.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.680
Whether that's telling them to sign the contributor license agreement or formatting fixes or pinging the relevant core dev or whatever.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.500
So that was kind of how I dove into that.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.880
All this terminology that you're using, PRs and stuff.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.480
No, this is great.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.980
What I was going to say is that this is new to Python, right?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.660
It wasn't that long ago that Python was on Mercurial or before then Subversion.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.940
It's, you know, it's coming over to GitHub is kind of a big deal.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.780
And I feel like it's really opened the door for more people to be willing to contribute.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.320
What do you think?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.540
Oh, it absolutely lowered the barrier to entry for people like me.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:07:01.460
Like using the old bugstoppython.org was tough at first, but I eventually kind of got used to it just in time for it to be replaced with GitHub issues, which I much prefer.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:10.680
But I have a hard time seeing myself emailing patches around or, you know, I have a lot of respect for people where that was the development flow a number of years ago.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.960
So I became a core developer in 2020.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:21.520
And I guess it was about exactly a year ago, almost exactly a year ago, I joined the Python performance team here at Microsoft.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.260
Were you at Microsoft before then?

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.200
No, I was not.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.280
I worked for a company called Research Affiliates in Newport Beach.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.040
And I think you actually had my old manager, Chris Ariza, on the show a couple years ago.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.220
I have had Chris on the show.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.880
That's fantastic.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.460
Small world, huh?

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:36.960
Yep.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.860
Small Python world.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.060
Yeah, small Python world.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.780
Just a couple million of us.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.960
No, that's great.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.080
So this brings us to our main topic.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.060
And, you know, let's start at the top, I guess.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.660
You know, there's the faster Python team, I guess.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.780
I don't know.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.160
How do you all refer to yourself?

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.380
Yeah, we refer to ourselves as the faster CPython team.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:06.800
I think internally our distribution list is the CPython performance engineering team, which sounds a little gnarlier, but it's a lot wordier.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.900
That's a cool title to have on a resume, isn't it?

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.400
Yeah, I think I'll use that one.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.720
There you go.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.520
There's been a ton of progress.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.400
And some of this work was done in 3.10.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.200
But, you know, there's this article here that I got pulled up on the screen.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.760
It says, Python 3.11 performance benchmarks are looking fantastic.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.220
That's got to make you feel good, huh?

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.860
I mean, they were looking fantastic back in, what, June?

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.660
Yeah.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.020
They're a small bit more fantastic now.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.720
So, yeah.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.060
Yeah, exactly.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.360
This article's from June.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.700
So this is a, it's only better from here, you know, from there, right?

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.000
It's really exciting.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.480
And like I said, it's, this is a performance jump that at least since I've been involved in Python, we haven't seen this in a point release.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:58.580
You know, where we're seeing 25, 30%, sometimes more improvements for pure Python code rather than kind of the 5, 10, 15% range that might be more typical.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:06.660
And again, I think that's kind of a product of this very conscious effort, whether it's my team or that a lot of people that we interact with.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:14.040
So, for example, Pablo, release manager, strength council member at Bloomberg has been working a lot on this stuff with us.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.300
Outside contributors, do they come to mind or Dennis Sweeney, Ken Jin.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.520
There's definitely been a focus on this and it's paying off, which is really exciting, like I said.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:24.940
Yeah.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:32.140
And maybe a little bit more in parallel instead of a cooperative effort, but there's also the Cinder folks over at Meta Facebook.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.340
That's absolutely a cooperative effort.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:44.520
You know, even though Cinder isn't necessarily, we're not merging all of Cinder back into CPython, several of the changes are being upstreamed into CPython.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:52.980
And in fact, just earlier this week on Tuesday, we had, I think, like a two-hour meeting where the Cinder team walked our team through how their JIT works.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.320
Yeah.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.380
So it's, even though, yeah, it can be seen as a parallel effort, I think it's very collaborative.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:04.540
I think also, I, like you, am very much blown away at the step size of the performance improvements.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:12.380
It's just super surprising to me that a 30-year-old language and a 30-year-old runtime can get that much better in that short of a time.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:12.780
Yeah.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:24.780
And I think, again, I feel like I'm going to keep coming back to this, but having, you know, full-time people dedicated to this, having teams of people dedicated to this, I think that's a big part of sort of unlocking this.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:41.580
Because some of the things that are required for those big jumps are kind of larger architectural changes that, you know, a single volunteer who's, you know, doing this on their free time probably wouldn't have been able to do without coordinating with others and without throwing, you know, a significant amount of effort at it.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:41.940
Yeah.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.880
I mean, there are people out there, core devs, who have done amazing stuff.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.540
Shout out to Victor Stinner.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:53.720
I feel like a lot of the performance stuff that I've seen in the last couple of years, he is somehow associated with, you know, some major change.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:59.940
But the changes that are being undertaken here, they're much more holistic and far-reaching.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.400
And it really does take a team, I think, to make it reasonable, right?

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.820
What's cool about the 3.11 effort is it's a combination of kind of both sorts of changes.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:15.300
So we have, you know, a bunch of kind of one-off, very targeted changes, probably five or six or ten of those.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:21.520
And then we have, you know, one or two of these kind of larger changes that, you know, we can build upon in the future.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:28.220
And they're never really done, which, you know, that's exciting because it means we get to keep making Python faster.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:28.640
Yeah.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.360
It is exciting.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:40.880
I think another area to just highlight real quick before we get into too much detail is, correct me if I'm wrong, but none of this is particularly focused on multi-core parallelism, right?

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.440
No.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.260
So one member of our team, Eric Snow, he's basically the sub-interpreter guy.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:46.940
Exactly.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.940
Yeah.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:55.820
So he is focusing most of his time on, you know, a per-interpreter kill and, you know, all that sort of stuff.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:02.420
But, I mean, all the numbers that you're looking at here and all of our benchmarks, it's all single-threaded, single process.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:07.340
If you're running Python code, it will get faster without you changing your code, which is awesome.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.840
Yeah, it's super awesome.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:23.580
I want to highlight that because if Eric manages to unlock multi-core performance without much contention or trade-offs or, you know, if you've got an eight-core machine and you get 7x performance by using all the cores, like, that would be amazing.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:28.900
But all of this work you're doing applies to everyone, even if they're trying to do that stuff, right?

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:38.560
So even if somehow we get this multi-core stuff, the computational multi-core stuff working super well, the work that you're doing and the team is doing is going to make it faster on every one of those cores, right?

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.740
So they're kind of multiplicative initiatives, right?

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:49.840
So if we could get a big improvement in the parallel stuff, it's only going to just multiply how much better this aspect of it's going to be for people who use that, right?

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.680
It's great to be kind of pursuing all these different avenues because they pay off in different timeframes, right?

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.520
Some of these are longer efforts.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.540
And in Eric's case, the 7x program for very long effort.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.180
I think he's done a great job sticking with it and seeing it through.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.940
And some of these we're seeing in point releases.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.160
And so they absolutely build on each other.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.000
Like you said, you can get a 7x increase from sub-interpreter just to throw out a number.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.940
But Python as a whole got 25% or 30% faster than you're seeing much more than a 7x increase.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.420
Right.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:19.860
Absolutely.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.900
So very, very exciting times.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.420
Two things before we get into the details of a particular interpreter and stuff.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.700
Tell me a bit about this team.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:35.080
You know, I interviewed Guido and Mark Shannon a while ago, about a year ago, I suppose, about this plan when they were kicking it off.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.240
And we didn't have these numbers or anything, but we did talk about what we were doing.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.700
And he talked about the team that he's working with there.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.340
So he said, certainly it's just more than the two of us.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.700
You know, tell us about the team.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.100
Yeah.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.000
So I think there are seven people.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.500
So there's Guido and Mark, Eric and me, as we mentioned.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.480
Another core developer, Urit.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.520
One other engineer, El.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:04.620
And a manager for the team who also does some engineering effort as well and is a member of the triage team, Mike Dronfum.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:04.980
Yeah.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:05.240
Nice.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.660
Yeah.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:05.860
Yeah.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.440
He worked on Pyoxidizer.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.560
Pyodide.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:09.980
That's right.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.520
Pyodide.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:10.680
Yeah.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.220
I don't know why.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.140
It's a pie.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.100
There's some kind of like a molecule on the end.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.580
Exactly.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.220
Exactly.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.300
Pyoxidizer.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:18.720
That's right.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.880
That's the foundation for PyScript, actually, which is quite cool.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.820
Py3 is cool too.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.180
The other question.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:24.660
Yeah.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.160
Yeah.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:25.480
Yeah.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:25.600
Yeah.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:25.720
Yeah.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:35.180
The other thing that I want to ask you about is, so we have these numbers and visibility into Python 3.11 that's got a lot of conversations going.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.020
And people are saying they're looking amazing and fantastic and other nice adjectives.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.520
But this is in beta, maybe soon to BRC.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.240
I'm not sure.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.380
What is Python 3.11 status these days?

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.560
3.11, we just released our last release candidate, I think this week.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:52.600
Right.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:15:01.940
So this, if basically the idea is this, the final release candidate and the actual 3.11 release should be the exact same thing.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:10.160
Unless we find any serious bugs that we're fixing before 3.11 won, the release candidate is going to be 3.11.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.660
Awesome.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.780
This is as close to stable as any of the releases.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.260
Almost there, right?

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:14.720
Okay.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.080
Yeah.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:15.460
Cool.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.300
So the reason I ask that is a lot of the work you've been doing recently is probably on 3.12, right?

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:20.780
Yes.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.100
Yeah.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:29.740
So beta freeze, which is basically when we go from alphas into betas, and there's no more basically new features allowed at that point.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.760
That happens every May.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.020
And so everything that we've been working on since May goes into 3.12.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.780
Are you excited about the progress you've made?

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.140
Yeah.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:37.500
Yeah.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.000
Very excited.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.400
It seems to be still coming along well.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:39.860
Yes.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.360
Yeah.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.200
And it's nice.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.240
We still have a lot of time before the next beta.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:48.680
Let's talk really quickly about the faster-cpython thing put together by Mark Shannon.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.880
Guido called it the Shannon plan.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.220
And the idea is, how can we make Python five times faster?

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.860
If we could take Python and make it five times faster, that would be a really huge deal.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.000
And again, none of that is multi-core.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.760
If you could somehow unlock all the cores and you've got eight, that's 35 or 40 or something like that.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.080
This is an ambitious plan.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.820
It started out with a little bit of work with 3.10.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:18.860
Is that when the adaptive specializing interpreter first appeared, or did it actually wait until 3.11 to show up?

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.340
No, I don't believe we.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.680
We don't have it at 3.10.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.840
Yeah, I didn't think so either.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.420
Missing something.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:23.720
Yeah.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.060
Yeah.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.480
So that's in 3.11.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.860
The rest of it looks accurate, though.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.820
Yeah.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.580
So then basically that was stage one.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.940
Stage two is 3.11, where there's a bunch of things, including kicking over the interpreter.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.080
We're going to talk about the specializing interpreter.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.860
A bunch of small changes here.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.780
And then stage three for 3.12 is JIT.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.220
Have you guys done any work on any of the JIT stuff?

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.600
Right now, it's not looking like 3.12 will ship with a JIT.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.940
We think there are other changes that we can make that don't require a JIT that will still pay off.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.000
We're probably planning on at least experimenting with what a JIT would look like.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.360
Like I said, we already have gotten kind of a guide towards Cinder's JIT.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.780
And so we're talking kind of high-level architecture and prototyping and that sort of thing.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.640
But I would be surprised if 3.12 shipped with JIT.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.020
But it's a long effort.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.380
So starting now is a big part of that.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.480
Research is being done, huh?

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.000
Yes.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.680
Actively.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:19.900
Yeah.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.320
Yeah.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:20.620
Cool.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.120
All right.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:26.120
Well, this was put together quite a while ago, back in 2020, as here's our plan.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.820
And of course, plans are meant to evolve, right?

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:35.720
But still, looks like this plan is working out quite well because of the changes in performance that we saw already in 3.11 beta.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.280
And pretty fantastic.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:43.060
There are a bunch of changes here about things like zero overhead exception handling.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.740
I believe there was an overhead for entering the try block.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.060
Every time you went in or out of a try accept block.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.260
So even if I did try pass, accept pass, there was overhead associated with that.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:56.980
Right.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:03.460
So basically, we would push a block that says, oh, if an exception happens, jump to this location.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:10.140
Now what we do is we realize, oh, we actually have that information ahead of time when we're actually compiling the bytecode.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:24.920
So since the common case is that an exception is raised, then we can store that data in a separate table and say, oh, if an exception is raised at this instruction, then jump here without actually having to do any of that management at runtime.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.760
So it's a little more expensive.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.860
I believe if an exception is raised.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.800
But in the case of an exception, it's not raised.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.860
I think it is basically as close to truly zero cost as possible.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.440
This portion of talk, I think it's a little bit more.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.380
This portion of talk, Python to me is brought to you by Microsoft for startups, founders hub.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.100
Starting a business is hard.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:48.020
By some estimates, over 90% of startups will go out of business in just their first year.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:57.100
With that in mind, Microsoft for startups set out to understand what startups need to be successful and to create a digital platform to help them overcome those challenges.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.200
Microsoft for startups founders hub was born.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.900
Founders hub provides all founders at any stage with free resources to solve their startup challenges.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:14.600
The platform provides technology benefits, access to expert guidance and skilled resources, mentorship and networking connections, and much more.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:23.680
Unlike others in the industry, Microsoft for startups founders hub doesn't require startups to be investor backed or third party validated to participate.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.080

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.020
Thank you to Microsoft for supporting the show.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.660
I think that's the way it should be.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.240
You know, exceptions, as the word implies, is not the main thing that happens.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.280
It's some unusual case that has happened, right?

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.860
So not always, but often means something has gone wrong.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.040
So if something goes wrong, well, you kind of put performance to the side anyway, right?

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:39.380
Yeah.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:49.320
Well, and, you know, a lot of the sort of optimizations that you want to see, especially in, for example, JIT code or whatever, exceptions are the sort of thing that mess that up.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:57.200
Where, you know, if an exception is raised, okay, get out of the TUDIC code, go back to slow land where we know what's going on and have better control of context and everything.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.500
But yeah, no, it's really exciting to see.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.200
It's really cool design.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.600
Yeah, it was Mark Shannon who did this.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.840
Mark Shannon did a lot of this.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:15.500
There's a bunch of improvements coming along, but what I want to really focus on here is the PEP 659, the specializing adaptive interpreter.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:26.400
And in addition to being on the team, you've created a really cool project, which we're going to talk about as soon as we cover this one, about how you actually visualize this and maybe even change your code to make it faster.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.860
Understanding how maybe opportunities might be missed for your code to be specialized or adapted.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.720
No, PEP 659.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.500
I mean, the concepts are not too difficult, but the implementation is really hairy.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.180
So I think it definitely deserves to be gone over 70.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.120
Because it's really cool when you get down to how it actually works and what it's doing.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.060
Is this the biggest reason for performance boosts in 3.11?

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.580
I think it's the most important reason for performance boosts.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.720
I mean, any performance boost kind of depends on what you're doing, right?

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:04.600
Like we did, for example, Pablo and Mark worked together on making Python to Python calls way faster and way more efficient.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.740
So if you're doing lots of recursive stuff, that's going to be the game changer.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:12.880
If you spend all your time writing loops that just do try, accept, try, accept.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.860
Yeah.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:14.900
That one's better.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:15.360
Yeah.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.200
If you're, yeah, got it.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.120
Try accept in tight lubes or, you know, if you're, you do lots of regular expressions,

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.320
then our improvements in that area will probably matter more than this.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:32.640
But this is cool because we can build upon it to kind of unlock additional performance improvements.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.080
Sure.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.920
We can kind of get to that once we have a better idea of how exactly.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:42.580
When I look at PEPs, usually it'll say what its status is and what version of Python it applies to.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.880
And I see this PEP, it doesn't say which version it applies to and its status is draft.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.080
What's the story here?

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.080
I'm actually not sure what the story is behind the PEP itself.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:58.380
I think it's a good informational document that explains, you know, the changes that we did get into Python 3.11.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.560
But I don't think the PEP was ever formally accepted.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.200
As you can see, it's just an informational PEP.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.860
So it's kind of more the design of what exactly we're doing and how we plan to do it.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.340
Right.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:17.620
Because it's not really talking about the implementation so much as like, here's the roadmap and here's what we plan to do and stuff.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:17.820
Right?

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:18.240
Yeah.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.760
There's a lot of pros in there that says, here's how we might do it.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.660
But, you know, no promises.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.560
We could change this literally anytime.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.280
And we have.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:25.460
Yeah.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.600
The design has changed fairly significantly since this PEP was first published.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.800
But we've updated that so it can remain.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.340
Yeah.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:33.640
Cool.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.160
Okay.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:41.040
So the background is when we're running code, it's not compiled and it's not static types.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.460
Right?

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.080
It's because it's Python.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:43.920
It's dynamic.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.340
And the types could change.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:50.820
They could change because it just uses duck typing and we might just happen to pass different things over.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.220
I mean, we do have type hints.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:58.100
But as the word there is, it applies as a hint, not a requirement like C++ or C Sharp or something.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:05.720
You have to have the CPython runtime be as general as possible for many of its operations.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.020
Right?

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:06.940
Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.120
And beyond just types, things like I could create a global variable at any time.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.180
I could delete a global variable at any time.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.500
I could add or remove arbitrary attributes.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:22.440
All these sort of very Pythonic things about Python or un-Pythonic, depending on how you're looking at it.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.160
These are all things that would never fly in pilot length.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:31.060
Yeah, and they mean you can't be overly specific about how you work with operations.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:36.840
So, for example, if you say, I want to work with call this function and pass it the value of X.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.640
Well, where did X come from?

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.840
Is X a built-in?

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.640
Is it a global variable?

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.520
Is it at the module level?

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.620
Is it a parameter?

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.740
Is it a local variable?

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.440
All these things have to be discovered at runtime, right?

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.560
For the most part, yeah.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.600
Yeah, for the most part.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:25:04.120
Part of this adapting interpreter is it will run the code and it says, look, every single time they said load this variable called X, it came out of the built-ins, not out of a module.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.500
And so we're going to replace that code, specialize it, or quicken it.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.820
I've heard of quickening, so I'll have to work on the nomenclature a little bit there.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.200
We can clear up the terms a bit, yeah.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:22.480
Yeah, yeah, but you're going to take this code and you're going to replace it and don't say just load an attribute or load a value from somewhere and go look in all the places.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.380
You're like, no, no, no, go look in the built-ins and just get it from there.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.420
And that skips a lot of steps, right?

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.120
Yep, yeah.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.760
Or maybe I'm doing math here and every single time it's been an integer.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.720
So let's just do integer math and not arbitrary addition operator.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:49.560
With the huge asterisk that if it does become a global variable or if it does start throwing floats at your addition operation, that we don't say false or even produce an incorrect result.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.820
Right, because you could say, use x.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.920
But before that, you might say, if some value is true, x equals this thing.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.220
And it goes from being a built-in to a local variable or some weird thing like that, right?

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:05.080
And if it overly specialized and couldn't fall back, well, bad things happen, right?

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.620
Yeah, it would be surprising if you were getting len, the len function from the built-ins over and over and over.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:14.120
And then you, for some reason, define len as a global.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.520
Python, you know, the language specification says it's going to start loading the global now,

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.180
regardless of, you know, where it made it be able to pull.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.660
And that's the same for, you know, like attribute accesses.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.240
If you used to be getting an attribute off the class and then you shadow it on the instance,

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.180
you need to start getting it from the instance now.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.640
You can't keep getting it from the class.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.200
Is it correct?

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:32.760
Right.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:39.740
And this is one of those problems that arises from this being a static dynamic language that can be changed as the code runs.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:44.940
Because if this was compiled, wherever those things came from and what they were, they can't change.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.900
Their type was set.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.260
Their location was set.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.580
And so then the compiler can say, well, it's better if we inline this.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:59.220
Or it's better if we do this machine operation that works on integers better or some special thing like that.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:26:59.440
Right.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.260
It doesn't have to worry about it falling back.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:07.360
And I feel like that ability to adapt and change and just be super dynamic is what's kind of held it back a lot.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:07.600
Right.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.000
Yep.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.360
And I like that word they used, adapt, because that's kind of a big part of how the new interpreter works.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.980
You can change your code and the interpreter adapts with it.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:24.920
If X starts being an attribute on the instance rather than from the class, well, soon the interpreter will learn that sometime later after running your program.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.300
And then, OK, start doing the fast path for instance access rather than class access.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.240
Let's start there.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.420
How does it know?

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:31.740
Right.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.660
It doesn't compile.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.200
So it has to figure this stuff out.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:36.440
Right.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.280
I run my code.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:42.260
Why does it know that I can now treat these things X and Y's integers versus strings?

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:42.740
Yeah.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.560
So stepping back a little bit, like how does this new interpreter work?

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:54.800
So the big change, kind of the headline is that the bytecode instructions can change themselves while they're running.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:07.560
Something that used to be a generic ad operation can become something that is specialized, which is kind of the specialized instruction is the terminology we use for adding two integers or adding two floats.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.540
And so this happens sort of in a couple of different phases.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:18.560
After you've run your code for some amount of time, basically after we've determined it's worth optimizing because optimization is free.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.720
So if something's only run once, you know, it's module level code or a class body.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.500
There's no, no reason to optimize that at all for like leader runs.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:26.620
Yeah.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:27.180
Yeah.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.380
We have heuristics for, okay, this, this code is warm.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:35.400
And that's, you know, a term that you hear in JITs often because it's a higher order for specializing.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:42.760
Basically after we've determined that a block of code is warm, we quicken it, which is that term that you used earlier.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:50.680
And this basically means walking over the bytecode instructions and replacing many of them with what we call adaptive variant.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:55.900
And, you know, you can, you can see an example in the pet, but you have to kind of walk through that example.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:01.580
If you have an attribute load, once the code is quickened after we've determined it's warm, we walk over all the instructions.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:06.360
All of the load attributes by code instructions become load adder adaptive.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:18.020
And what those adaptive instructions do is when we hit them, when we're actually doing the attribute load, in addition to actually loading the attribute, they will kind of do some fact finding.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:26.100
They'll gather some information and say, okay, I loaded the attribute, did it come from the class, did it come from the instance, did it come from the plot, did it come from a dict, did it come from a module?

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.600
You know, there's, there's a bunch of different possibilities.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.200
Oh.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:36.340
And so using that information, the adaptive instruction can turn itself into one of the specialized instructions.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:41.540
So the example you have here on the screen can either be load adder instance value or module or slot.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.220
And what the specialized instructions do is really cool.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:49.760
Basically, they start with a couple of checks just to make sure if the assumptions are holding true.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:58.260
So for a load adder instance value, we, you know, check and make sure that, for example, the class of the object is as we expect.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:05.980
Then our attribute isn't shadowed by a descriptor or something weird like that, or that we're not now getting it off of a class object or whatever.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.100
And then it has a very optimized form of getting the actual attribute.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:19.260
There's a lot of expensive work that you can skip if you know that, you know, you have an attribute that is coming directly off the instance.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.220
Or another one is load adder slot.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.400
Slots are really interesting for Python performance.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:31.340
And, you know, they kind of capture more than a lot of the stuff, the difference of the possible and the common.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:41.940
And by that, I mean, it's possible that every time you access a field off of a class, that it was dynamically added and it came from somewhere else and it's totally new and it could be any type.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:46.980
What's more likely, though, is it's, you know, the customer always has a name and the name is always a string.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.500
Right.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.380
And with slots, you can sort of say, I don't want this particular class to be dynamic.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:31:01.220
And because of that, you can say, well, it doesn't need to have a dictionary that can evolve dynamically, which improves the access speed and the storage and all of that.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:09.660
And here you all are pointing out that, well, we could actually have a special opcode that knows whenever I access X, X is a slot thing.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.880
Skip all the other checks you might have to do before you get there.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.420
Well, yeah.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.580
And even accessing the slot is going to be faster.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:23.220
So I'm not 100% brushed up on how load adder slot works, but the slots are implemented using descriptors.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:35.100
So to get the slot from your class, you still, or from your instance, you still need to go to the class, look up the attribute in the class dict, find the descriptor, verify it's a descriptor, call the descriptor.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.020
Into that list.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:36.260
Yeah.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.160
Exactly.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.000
We can do it even faster than that.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.480
So even if you do have slots, this happens really fast without even any dictionary lookups.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.360
We say, has the class changed?

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:46.840
No.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.840
Okay, cool.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:55.200
We'll get to this later, but we remember what offset the slot was at last time and we just reach directly to the object.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:55.740
Grab it.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.180
There's no dictionary lookups.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.200
We're not calling any descriptors, doing anything like that.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:04.900
It's about as close to, you know, a compiled language as a dynamic language would be.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.400
Yeah.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.240
Just verify it.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:06.900
Class has a change.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.580
Okay, reach in.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.500
I remember where it was.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.980
You know, I tried to kind of align this up saying the possible and the common.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.140
Most likely your code is not changing.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.560
And when it's well written, it's probably using the same type.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.120
You know, it's not like, well, sometimes it's a string and sometimes like that is the quote seven.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.060
And sometimes it's the actual integer seven.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.400
Like it should probably always be one.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.560
You just don't express that in code unless you're using type hints, right?

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.400
And they're not enforced.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:31.640
Yeah.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.040
Yeah.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.420
And getting back to the adaptive nature and making sure that we are correct.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:45.460
You know, if we had something that was a slotted instance coming through a bunch of times and that suddenly you throw a module in or something with an instance dictionary or something else,

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:55.000
or maybe the attribute doesn't exist or those quick checks that I mentioned that happen before we actually do the fast implementation of loading a slot.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.320
If any of those checks fail, then we basically fall back on the generic implementation.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.080
We say, oh, our assumptions don't hold.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:03.500
Go back.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.980
And if that happens enough time, then we go back to the adaptive form and the whole cycle.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:15.660
So if I'm throwing a bunch of integers into an add instruction and then later I stop and I start throwing a bunch of strings into an add instruction,

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.160
we'll do the generic version of add for a little bit while we're kind of switching over.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:25.340
But then the interpreter will kind of get the hint and start, you know, specializing for string edition later.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.100
And it's really cool to see that happen.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:32.940
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by the Compiler Podcast from Red Hat.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.920
Just like you, I'm a big fan of podcasts.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.280
And I'm happy to share a new one from a highly respected and open source company.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.440
Compiler, an original podcast from Red Hat.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.260
With more and more of us working from home, it's important to keep our human connection with technology.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.280
With Compiler, you'll do just that.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:57.880
The Compiler Podcast unravels industry topics, trends, and things you've always wanted to know about tech through interviews with people who know it best.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.820
These conversations include answering big questions like, what is technical debt?

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.380
What are hiring managers actually looking for?

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.680
And do you have to know how to code to get started in open source?

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.240
I was a guest on Red Hat's previous podcast, Command Line Heroes,

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:16.520
and Compiler follows along in that excellent and polished style we came to expect from that show.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:20.200
I just listened to episode 12 of Compiler, How Should We Handle Failure?

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.080
I really valued their conversation about making space for developers to fail

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:29.760
so that they can learn and grow without fear of making mistakes or taking down the production website.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.220
It's a conversation we can all relate to, I'm sure.

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:36.620
Listen to an episode of Compiler by visiting talkpython.fm/compiler.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.720
The link is in your podcast player's show notes.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:44.960
You can listen to Compiler on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, Pocket Cast, or anywhere you listen to your podcasts.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.220
And yes, of course, you could subscribe by just searching for it in your podcast player,

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:55.360
but do so by following talkpython.fm/compiler so that they know that you came from Talk Python to me.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:00.320
My thanks to the Compiler Podcast for keeping this podcast going strong.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:09.520
Right, so we shouldn't, we being Python developers that write code that just executes without thinking too very much about what that means,

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.280
we should not have to worry or maybe even know that this is happening, right?

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.580
If everything goes as it's supposed to, it should be completely transparent to us.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.020
Yes.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:25.300
The only way that you should know that anything is different about 3.11 is your CPU cycles.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.540
The cloud hosting bill is the end of the month.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.220
You should be able to upgrade and if behavior changes, that's a buck.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.140
Tell us about that.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:39.420
Going from this adaptive version, the adaptive instance sounds slightly more expensive than the,

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.160
just the old school load adder, for example,

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.420
because it has to keep track and it does a little bit of inspecting to see what's going on.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.300
But then the new ones, once it gets adapted and quickened, it should be much faster.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:58.160
Is there a chance that it gets into some like weird loop where just about the time the adaptive one has decided to specialize it,

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:03.260
it hits a case where it falls back and it like it ends up being slower rather than faster before?

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:10.420
Well, yeah, the worst case scenario would be, you know, you send the same type through n number of times

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.600
and then right when it's going to try to specialize you, set it through a different type.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.260
Exactly.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:18.860
Whatever, if n is the limit, like if it goes to n plus one times and then trips it back.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.460
Yeah.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:19.660
Yeah.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.080
Yeah.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.240
So that would be sort of the worst case scenario.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.880
But we have kind of ways of trying to avoid that if at all possible.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.100
Okay.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:33.100
So, for example, if we fail one of those checks, we don't immediately turn into the adaptive form.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.860
We will do it after, you know, that check has failed a certain number of times.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:43.000
And as just a concrete example, that number of times that we have hard coded is a prime number.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:49.500
So it's less likely that you'll fall into these sort of patterns where it's like, oh, I send three ins through that string.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.000
Three ins.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.980
It'd be hard to, you know, get that worst case behavior without being intentionally malicious.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:37:01.320
By the way, we got to keep in mind, like these are extremely small steps in our code, right?

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:07.200
We might have multiple ones of these happening on a single line of what looks like, oh, there's one line of code.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:12.880
Like, well, there's five or however many instructions, bytecode instructions happening.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.760
And some of them may be specialized and some of them not, right?

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.580
Yeah, exactly.

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:24.440
And so the overall effect definitely smooths out where, sure, you may have a worst case behavior at one or two or three individual bytecode instructions.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:32.180
But your typical function is going to have much more than that, even a smallish function is going to have, you know, 20 or 30 instructions doing it, you know, real.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:32.600
Yeah.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.040
Yeah.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.620
If you care about its performance, it'll be doing a lot there.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.180
Exactly.

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.800
And so some will specialize successfully, some won't.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.240
But in general, your code will get 25-ish percent faster.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.120
Is there a way you could know?

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.940
I mean, is there a way that you might be able to know if it specializes or not?

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:47.780
We'll get to that.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:57.040
But it looks like if I go and use the disk module, D-I-S, not for disrespect, but for disassembly.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:57.780
Disassembly, yeah.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:02.480
So you can say, you know, import disk and then maybe from disk, import disk.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.520
You can say disk and give it a function or something.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.140
It'll write out the bytecode of what's happening.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:14.180
Does all of this mean that if I do this in 3.11, I might see additional bytecodes than before?

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.680
You know, instead of load adder, would I maybe see the load adder instance value?

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.340
Will I actually be able to observe these specializations?

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:26.060
If you pass a keyword argument to your disk utilities, then yes, you will be able to see.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:26.840
Okay.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:32.500
But if I don't, for compatibility reasons like load adder adaptive and load adder instance,

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.640
those are just going to return as load adder?

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.400
Load adder.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:35.700
Exactly.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.020
Okay.

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:36.260
Yeah.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.280
So the idea is anyone that's currently consuming the bytecode,

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.640
they shouldn't have to worry about specialization because the idea is they're totally transparent.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.580
You know, so they should only see what the original bytecode was.

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:51.700
But if you want to get at it, then yeah, if you get any of the disk utilities,

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:56.400
you could pass it adaptive through and that will show you the adaptive.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.920
And again, you'll only see them if it's actually gets quick at meaning if you run it,

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.460
you know, a dozen times or something.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:02.820
Okay.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:06.320
So if I wrote, say a function and so often what you're doing,

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.740
if you're playing with disk is like you write the function and then you immediately write,

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.240
print out the disk output.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.780
Maybe you've never called it.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.140
Right.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.700
And so that might actually give you a different,

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.880
even if you said yes to the specialization output,

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.280
that still might not give you anything interesting.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.280
It won't give you it.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:23.460
Yeah.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.800
It'll just give you as if you hadn't passed the keyboard argument.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.380
Because again, this all happens at runtime.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.540
So if the code isn't being run, nothing happens.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:33.380
You know, we don't specialize code that is ever run.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.300
What counts as warm, Mike?

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.920
How many times do I got to call it?

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:41.320
The official answer is that's an implementation detail of the interpreter subject to change at any time.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:46.900
The actual answer is either eight calls or eight times through a loop in a function.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.300
So if your function has a loop that executes more than eight times,

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.900
or if you call it more than eight times.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.920
So just calling your function eight times should be enough to quicken it.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.620
Right.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:02.880
Well, maybe that number changes in the future, but just having a sense, like, is it 10 or is it 10,000?

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.400
You know what I mean?

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.900
Like, where's the scale up before I see something?

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.820
Yeah, if you want to make sure it's quickened, but you don't want to take up too much time,

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.720
I'd say just run it a couple less at a time.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:15.360
As short man, when we're writing tests and stuff, we do like 100 or 1,000.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.860
Because that also gives it time to actually adapt to the actual data that you're sending.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.220
Because it's not enough to just quicken it, then you'll just have a bunch of adaptive instruction.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.400
They actually have to see something.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.820
Yeah, well, now we're paying attention.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.380
Like, great.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.080
You need to have something to pay attention to, right?

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.280
Yeah, and you'll see that too.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.460
Because if you have any sort of logic flow inside of your function,

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:38.120
when you're looking at the bytecode, any paths that are hit will be specialized,

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:42.920
but any paths that aren't obviously won't because we don't specialize dead code.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.440
So it has a bit of a code coverage aspect, right?

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.480
You can think about it like that.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.280
If you look at it, you might see part of your code and it's just,

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:55.360
it's unmodified because whatever you're doing to it didn't hit this else case ever.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.520
Yeah, well, and that's what's really exciting about this too,

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:03.000
is when you're, if you run your code a bunch of times and then you call this on it,

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:07.640
you see a lot of information that would potentially be useful if you were,

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.560
for example, JIT compiling that function.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:14.360
You see at every addition site, you're adding floats or ints.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.340
You see at every attribute load site, whether it's a slot or not,

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.560
you see where the dent code is, you see where the hot code.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.800
All that stuff is sort of getting back to what I said,

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.660
how this sort of enables us to build upon in the future.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:29.820
Not only can we add more specializations or specialize more op codes or,

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:35.880
you know, do that more efficiently, we can also use that information to kind of infer additional

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.420
properties about the code that are useful for, you know, other faster, lower representation.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.760
Yeah, I can certainly see how that might be.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.540
Might inform some kind of JIT engine in the future.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:45.960
Yeah.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.380
I think the PEP is interesting.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.740
The PEP 659, people can check that out.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.000
But like you said, it's informational.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.620
So it's not really the implementation exactly.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.160
Yeah.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.240
So let's talk a bit about your project that you did.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:03.540
In addition to just being on the team, the personal project that you did,

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:08.200
that basically takes all of these ideas we've been talking about and says, well, two things.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.180
One, can I take code and look at that and get that answer?

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:16.400
Again, kind of back to my code coverage example, like coloring code lines to mean stuff.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.520
And then what's interesting about this, and we'll talk to this example that you put up,

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.500
is there's actionable stuff you could do to make your code faster if you were in a super

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.660
tight loop section.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:32.780
Like I feel like applying this visualization could help you allow Python to specialize more

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:33.740
rather than less.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.180
Yeah.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:40.100
I mean, in general, this tool is really useful for us as maintainers of the specialization

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:44.420
stuff because we get to see, you know, where we're failing to specialize.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.140
Because ideally, you know, if we've done our job well, you should get past your Python

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.420
without changing your code at all.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:54.500
First and foremost, this is a tool for, you know, us in our work so that we can see, okay,

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.040
what can we still work on here?

00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:01.240
But that is sort of a cool knockout effect is that if you do run on your code, you also

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.580
know where it's not specializing.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:06.800
And if you know enough about how specialization works, you may be able to fix that.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:12.160
But I would say a word of caution against, you know, like getting two in the weeds and

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:16.320
trying to get every single bytecode to do what you want, because that's, there are much

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.120
better ways of making it faster, right?

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.720
There are places where you're like, these two functions, I know we got 20,000 lines

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:27.260
of Python, but these two, which are like 20 lines, they are so important.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.560
And they happen so frequently.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.280
Anything you can do to make them faster matters.

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.800
You know, people rewrite that kind of stuff in Rust or in Cython.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.680
Before you go that far, maybe adding a dot zero on the end of a number is all it takes.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:41.660
You know, something like that, right?

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.600
That's kind of what I'm getting at.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.640
Not to go crazy or try to think you should mess with the whole program.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.580
But there are these times where like five lines matter a lot.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.000
Yeah.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:50.640
Okay.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.160
Well, tell us about your project specialist.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:59.360
One really cool thing that our specializing adaptive interpreter does is we've worked really

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.960
hard to basically make it easy for us to get information about how well specializations

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.440
are working.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.980
So you can actually compile Python.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.820
It'll run a lot slower, but you can compile Python with this option with PyStats.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.720
And that basically dumps all of the specialization stats.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.320
Yeah.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:21.280
And you actually pointed out that you can, in the faster CPython idea section, it like lists

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.860
out like a...

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:22.860
Yeah.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.720
So there's tons of counters.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.540
So you can see that when we run our benchmarks, you know, load adder instance value is run

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.820
what, 2 billion times, almost 3 billion times.

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.520
And it misses its assumptions, 1% of those.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.160
And yeah.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.240
And so there's tons of these counters that you can dump.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.220
And that's really cool because we can run our performance benchmarks and see how those numbers

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:41.700
have changed.

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:47.460
And even cooler than that, it allows us kind of separately to, for example, there's been

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:51.740
at least one case where we've worked with a large company that has a big private internal

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:56.400
app and they can run it using Python 3.11 and we can get these stats without actually looking

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.940
at the source code, which is really cool.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:03.180
And so we want to help you be faster and we're working on the runtime, but we don't want you

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.240
don't want to show us your code.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.780
And so we're not going to look at it.

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:10.900
And so those stats are really useful for kind of knowing, okay, 90% of my attribute access

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:11.960
were able to be specialized.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.500
What about the remaining 10%?

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.100
Where are they?

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.720
So, you know, an additional question, like why couldn't they be specialized?

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.240
And that's something that's a lot easier to tell when you're looking at the code.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:28.080
And so this tool was basically my original intention for writing it is, you know, once we get beyond,

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:32.460
you know, seeing the stats for benchmark and we run something on it, that makes it easy to

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:36.100
tell at a glance where we're failing and how.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:36.540
Right.

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:41.680
It's like saying you have 96% code coverage versus these two lines are the ones that are not

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.260
getting covered.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.060
Exactly.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.780
You get a lot more information from actually getting those line numbers than from the 97%.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:54.720
And so basically the way it works, we already talked about how in the disk module, you can

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.560
see which instructions are adaptive or specialized.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.800
And all that this tool does, it visualizes.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:08.300
Literally the implementation of this tool is just a for loop over this, where we just kind

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:12.120
of categorize the different instructions and then map those to colors and all sorts of crazy

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:12.420
concepts.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:12.900
Yeah.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:12.900
Yeah.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:18.240
And for people listening, you know, imagine some code and here you've got a for loop with

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.300
the tuple decomposition.

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:24.220
So you got for I comma T in enumerative text that are going to do some stuff.

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:30.360
And it has the I and the T turned green, but then some dictionary access turned yellow.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.180
And it talks about, is it not at all specialized?

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.860
Is it, did it try but fail to get specialized?

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.340
And things like that, right?

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:38.740
Yep.

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:39.100
Yeah.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.100
So green indicates successful specializations.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:47.880
Red are those adaptive instructions that are slightly slower and represent missed specializations.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.240
Yellow and orange are kind of a gradient.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:55.940
As we talked about, you know, one line of Python code easily be 10 or 20 byte code instruction.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:56.800
Right.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.120
Yeah.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:57.200
Yeah.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.640
It's kind of a way of compressing that information.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.260
It's really.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:06.220
And one thing I want to point out about this too is, you know, you'll notice it's actually,

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.020
you see characters within a line.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:12.640
And this is something that's really cool because this is piggybacking on a feature that's completely

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.920
unrelated to specialization.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.260
Originally, when I was writing this, it highlighted each line.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.720
So you could see this line was kind of green or this line was kind of yellow.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:29.320
But then I remembered, maybe you're familiar, in Python 3.11, we have really, really formative

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:34.360
tracebacks where it will actually underline the part of the code that has a syntax error that

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.580
has an exception that was raised or something.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.140
And so that's the PEP that's linked first in the description there.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:46.560
It's, you know, called fine-grained error locate or fine-grained locations tracebacks.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:51.100
And so what that means is that previously we just had line number information in the bytecode,

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:56.120
but now we have line number and end line number and start column and end column information,

00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:01.520
which means that due to this completely unrelated feature, we can now also map it directly to which

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.440
characters in source file correspond to individual bytecode.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.560
That's super cool.

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:05.780
Yeah.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:12.820
So for example, here we've got a string and you're accessing it by element, by passing an index,

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:19.180
and you were able to highlight the square brackets as a separate classification on that array indexing

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.620
or that string indexing.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:21.140
Exactly.

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:25.360
So it wouldn't have been as helpful to just see that that line was kind of yellow-orange-ish.

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.680
You know, we see that the fast variable store was really, really quick.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:36.860
We see that, you know, the modulo operation and the indexing of string by int wasn't that fast.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:46.000
We weren't able to specialize it, but, you know, we were able to specialize, you know, the lookup of the name TILEN.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.780
We weren't able to specialize the function column.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.580
So that sort of information, that granularity is really, really cool.

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.640
Yeah, it is super cool.

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.640
And I think a good way to go through this, you know, you've got some more background that you write about here,

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.340
but we've already talked a lot about specializing.

00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.740
Yeah, this is just summarizing the pet piece.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.200
Yeah, exactly.

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:04.080
People can check it out there if they want the TILEN, the too-long-didn't-read version.

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:11.760
But you've got this really nice example of, you know, what may be in the first few weeks of some kind of Python programming class.

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:16.880
Write a program that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius and Celsius to Fahrenheit,

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:24.380
and then just tests that, you know, round-tripping numbers gives you basically the same answer back within floating-point variations, right?

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:31.300
Yeah, I really like this example because it, you know, as we'll show, it's kind of presented through the lens of performance optimization,

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:37.360
but it also does a good job of showing you kind of how the interpreter works and how those little tweaks kind of cascade.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.740
Mm-hmm, absolutely.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:44.220
And it highlights certain things you can take advantage of that, you know, if you just slightly change the order,

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:48.160
it actually has a different runtime behavior, which we don't often think about in Python.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.240
We're doing C++.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.360
We would maybe debate, do you dereference that pointer first, or can you do it in the loop?

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.200
Yeah.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.020
But not so much here.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:50:03.960
So let's go through, I mean, I guess just to remind people, Fahrenheit to Celsius, you would say X equals F minus 32,

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:08.980
and then you multiply the result once you've shifted the zero by five divided by nine,

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:15.660
and the reverse is you multiply the Celsius by nine divided by five, and then you add the 32 to shift the zero again.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.480
And basically that's all there is to it.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.820
And then you go through and say, well, let's run the specialist on it to get its output.

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:24.580
And maybe talk about this first variation that we get here.

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:24.940
Yeah.

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:32.280
So as we were talking about, you know, the red indicates is adaptive instructions, and the green indicates the specialized instruction.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.240
So we can see here that some things were specialized very well.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.580
For instance, look at a cert roundtrip.

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.840
You know, that's great green.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:46.980
Because it's in that hot loop, we got enough information about it to say, okay, a cert roundtrip is being loaded from the global namespace.

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:48.660
And it's a Python function.

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:53.180
So we can do that cool Python to Python call optimization.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:58.760
And, you know, that's basically as fast as any function call in Python is going to be.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.260
But some things aren't specialized.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:08.860
So the things that jump out, you know, the things that we may want to actually take a closer look at would be the map, which is, you know, yellow and red.

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:23.140
So, for instance, we can, the loads of the local variable f in that first function and the load of the constant 32, those are yellow because the map that they're involved in, the subtraction operation, wasn't specialized.

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:26.040
But the individual loads of those instructions were specialized.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:26.780
I see.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.080
So half yes, half no for what they were involved in.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:29.520
Yeah, yeah.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.580
Green plus red equals yellow.

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.500
So, yeah.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.520
So that subtraction wasn't specialized.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:48.200
And the reason is, is in 3.11, just based on heuristics that we gathered, we determined it was worth it, at least for the time being, to optimize int plus int, float plus float, but not int plus float, float plus int.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.600
And so what we're doing here is we're subtracting a float and an int.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.860
And so we're able to see that that isn't specializable.

00:51:55.860 --> 00:52:01.380
But if we were to somehow change that so that it was two floats, two ints, then it would be specializable.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:01.860
Right.

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:04.600
Because when I look at it, it looks like it absolutely should have been specialized.

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.160
I have a float minus an int.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.940
The int is even a constant.

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:13.180
Like you're, okay, well, this is standard math.

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.600
And it's always a float and it's always an int and it's always subtraction.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:16.940
Right.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:20.580
It seems like that should just, well, the math should be obvious and fast.

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:26.240
But because, as you pointed out, there's this peculiarity or maybe an implementation detail for the moment.

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.700
Absolutely an implementation detail.

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:28.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:28.640
Yeah.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:33.040
If it's an int and a float, well, right now that problem is not solved.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.400
Maybe it will be in the future, right?

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.920
It seems like pretty low hanging fruit, but you've got all the variations, right?

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:38.440
Yeah.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.660
Specializations aren't free.

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:46.520
So for instance, like when we're running those adaptive instructions, we need to check for all of the different possible specializations.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.360
So every time we add a new specialization that has some cost.

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:57.000
And basically we determined, at least for the time being, like I said, that we've tried to do int plus float and float plus int.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.600
At least based on the benchmarks that we have and the code that we've seen, it just isn't worth it.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:02.720
Sure.

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.060
Okay.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:03.960
Yeah.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.000
Yeah.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.560
And it's something like int plus int is very easy to do quickly.

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.240
Float plus float is very easy to do quickly.

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.520
Int plus float, there's some coercion that needs to happen there.

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.240
Right.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.880
So it's already constant anyway.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:16.100
Yeah.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:16.700
Yeah.

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:23.560
So it's not something that, it's something that caught some time to check, but we don't have a significantly faster wave.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.480
It doesn't happen on a register on the CPU or something.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.300
Yeah, exactly.

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.060
Okay.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.120
So then you say, well, look what the problem is.

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:36.660
It's float in int where we have f minus 32, which seems again, completely straightforward.

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.160
What if they're both floats?

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:41.860
Well, what if like, you know, it's going to end up a float in the end anyway.

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:44.460
How about make it 32.0 instead of 32?

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:44.940
Yep.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.040
And then bam, that whole line turns green, right?

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:47.440
Yep.

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:47.760
Yeah.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:55.760
So now you're basically doing that entire line using fast local variables and look like native floating point operation.

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.120
You're just adding literally two C doubles together, which is.

00:53:59.120 --> 00:53:59.600
Yeah.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:07.500
And this is what I was talking about where you could look at that line and go, oh, well, I just wrote the integer 32, but I'm doing floating point math.

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.920
It's not like I'm doing integer math.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:15.560
So if you just put, you know, write it as a constant with a zero, you know, dot zero on it, that's a pretty low effort change.

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.620
And here you go.

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.940
Python can help you more and go faster, right?

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:19.300
Yeah.

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:21.740
And that's not a transformation that we can do for you.

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:30.840
Because if F is an instance of some user class that defines dunder, so that would be a visible change if it started receiving a float as a right hand argument.

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:34.920
So those are things that we can't do while making the language still.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:35.640
Right.

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.000
But your specialist tool can show you.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.620
And again, figure out where your code is slow and then consider whether they're just like, well, we only got 100,000 lines.

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.100
Let's who's assigned to specializing today.

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:47.580
Yeah.

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:55.620
And it also requires, this is a simpler example, but it does require, you know, a somewhat deep knowledge of how the specialization work.

00:54:55.620 --> 00:55:01.100
Because for things other than binary operation, it's not going to become clear what the fix is.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:08.160
You just see kind of where the, I hesitate to even call it a problem, but you see where there's the potential for improvement, but not necessarily how to improve.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:08.560
Yeah.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:19.380
And then you have another one in here that's, I think, really interesting because it, so often when we're talking about math and at least commutative operations, it doesn't matter which order you do them in.

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.220
Like five times seven times three.

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:25.000
If it's the first two and then the result or multiply the last two.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.900
And, you know, unless there's some weird floating point edge case that, you know, the IEEE representation goes haywire.

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:31.780
It doesn't matter.

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:32.260
Right.

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:40.420
And so, for example, here you've got, you know, to finish off the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion, it's the X times five divided by nine.

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.160
And that one is busted too for the same reason, right?

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:43.800
Because it's a five.

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.160
Yeah.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.140
Because, so this is kind of for two reasons.

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:50.680
This line isn't as good as it could be under ideal conditions.

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:54.020
So, you know, X is a floating point number, five is an integer.

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:55.120
So we have the same problem.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:56:00.520
We specialize multiplication for int and int and float flows, but not for int and float.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.180
And the division is a different problem.

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:08.820
We don't try to specialize division at all for the reason that it's kind of problematic because the right hand side could be zero.

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:14.540
And then you have to check for that and all sorts of things that you need to check for that make it not as much of a payoff.

00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:21.180
So, you know, we have both an operation that we can't specialize, but it isn't being specialized.

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:24.420
And then another one that we're not even trying to specialize at all.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:29.680
But then back to the commutative thing, you're like, well, what if we did the division, right?

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.100
What if we did the division, like, parenthesis five divided by nine?

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.420
And then X times that, right?

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:35.860
Yep.

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:42.660
And so wading through more of these implementation details, Python's compiler, you know, we have a bytecode compiler.

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:46.440
It's not a compiling to machine code, but it can perform simple optimization.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:52.900
So by changing the order of operations, the bytecode compiler sees, oh, five divided by nine.

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:57.080
I can do that at compile time once rather than at runtime literally every time.

00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.620
That's never going to change.

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:00.180
And so by changing that order of a problem.

00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:01.160
Yeah.

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:01.460
Sorry.

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:04.200
Regardless of specialization, that's better anyway.

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:04.560
Right.

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:09.760
Because that happens when the PYC file is generated or when the equivalent thing in memory is generated.

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:13.040
And then it's just known as a constant, right?

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:13.420
Yeah.

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.260
And you're doing no division of runtime anymore.

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:20.200
So you turn this from two operations, one of which is pretty expensive, to just one operation.

00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:22.980
All you're doing is a multiply by a constant.

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:23.520
Oh.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:23.880
Yep.

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:29.400
And so you can see that, you know, once we apply that transformation to our code, everything's all break green.

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:32.000
This is as specialized as it is.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:32.340
Right.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:36.600
Because in Python 3, five divided by nine is a floating point, right?

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:36.980
Yes.

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.140
Doesn't module it out or whatever.

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:39.060
Yeah.

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:43.160
So then it becomes float times float, which then can be specialized.

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:50.280
And that first division part is something that is done at runtime when it first runs, but only once, which is fantastic.

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.540
Like parse time, basically.

00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:52.020
Yeah.

00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:58.260
So, yeah, this function or these functions, this code is much better as a result of just understanding.

00:57:58.260 --> 00:57:58.740
Yeah.

00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:03.080
And this transformation isn't something that Python can do for you because it changes the semantics of the language.

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:07.920
Again, if X is some user object, then it can serve the types that are being passed to it.

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:08.420
Yeah.

00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:11.360
If it implements multiply, it expected to receive the five.

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:16.700
It didn't expect to receive 1.2715 or whatever the heck that is, right?

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:17.060
Yep.

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:17.540
Yeah.

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:17.900
Cool.

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:18.420
All right.

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.680
Well, this is a really cool tool.

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:26.260
I definitely encourage people if they're listening, just, you know, come over and just there's pictures of code and color.

00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:29.120
Just scroll quickly through it to see what we're talking about.

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:34.920
And I find it super valuable because it highlights with color right on the code that you wrote.

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:45.000
It doesn't spit out the byte code and say, here's the byte code improvements, but it highlights your code and says the code you wrote is being improved by Python or not being improved by Python here.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:45.480
Right.

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:47.740
And just understanding that it might not matter.

00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:49.000
And it might matter a lot to you.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:49.360
It depends.

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:49.780
Yeah.

00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:58.280
And another thing to highlight, too, that's kind of different about this tool from maybe most tools that you would use is, you know, this isn't this isn't static analysis.

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:02.660
It's not like my pie or pilot where it's running over your code just in its file.

00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:06.660
You actually need to run your code under this tool for it to be able to do it.

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:08.420
Because, again, all this happens at runtime.

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:14.040
So it's only after running the code that specialists walk over and see where you're running the code out.

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.160
Enough, right?

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:15.920
Yes.

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.360
Yeah.

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:26.940
So, for example, if I just had this function and I didn't actually call test convergence at the bottom there, the dunder name equals paint, everything would just be white because nothing actually ran.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:27.420
Right.

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:27.780
Right.

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:32.140
So in this example here, you've got, let's see, two, four, six, eight, nine.

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.120
Surprising that number.

00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:38.240
You have nine test values that you're passing in and you're looping over all those values and testing it.

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:44.000
You need to, if you're going to apply this to your code, it's super important that you come up with a scenario of representative data.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.400
And for now, n greater than eight.

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.260
Who knows?

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:50.080
Or something that's loopy.

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:53.200
It's, you know, it runs loops eight times or something.

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:58.640
Basically, if the same bytecode instructions are being executed a bunch of times, that's how we tell that it's hot.

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.860
Whether that's in a loop or for repeated calls.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.260
I can see it's pretty easy to forget that.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.140
And people might run it and go, it didn't do anything.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:05.880
It did nothing.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:06.600
It's just all white.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.000
Yeah.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:07.400
Yeah.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:14.740
Maybe you should add, I mean, I'm not, I'm not trying to issue a, an audio PR or anything, but maybe it should have some kind of warning.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:19.020
Like if there's zero color at all, like a warning, like, are you sure you ran it?

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.560
Because we don't think you did anything.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.260
I actually really liked that request.

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:22.880
Do that.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.740
Yeah.

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.660
Cause you would know, right?

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.900
Like, you'd know if like I've colored nothing in any color whatsoever.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:29.640
Yeah.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.780
And I look at him like, oh, I did something wrong.

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.700
But someone else is going to be like, Fran did something wrong.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.640
Yes, exactly.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.680
Got to protect, got to protect my reputation.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.680
Well, and just like limit the issues being raised.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.900
Like how many times you want to say, did you remember to call, call it enough times?

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.400
Yeah.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.000
Yeah.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:46.440
Cool.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:56.100
I definitely think people should check this out if they're interested in seeing how the adaptive specializing, specializing adaptive interpreter from Python 3.11 is applied to their code.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:59.440
I guess also other caveat, like really not super handy.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.700
If you try to do this with 3.10, you got to have 3.11.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.960
It refuses to run under 3.10.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.340
Yeah.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:10.520
Cause I accidentally made that mistake enough times where I just had the Python environment I had acted with 3.10.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.580
I'm like, not working.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:11.800
Darn.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.700
Yeah.

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:13.560
It's all like again.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.320
It doesn't exist.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:14.640
Yeah.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.360
All that stuff.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:15.820
Yeah.

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:16.100
Yeah.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:16.280
Yeah.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:21.920
So, so yeah, no, you need to be running at 3.12, but, or sorry, 3.11 or 4.3.12.

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:26.100
But, you know, as you showed earlier, you can download it from Python.org.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:34.140
My favorite way of installing Python versions, PyN, has had 3.11 dev for a while now.

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:37.080
They also have 3.12 dev for crazy and you want to try it out.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.040
But, but yeah, you do need, you do need a 3.11.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.340
Fantastic.

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:42.420
Well, really great work.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.000
I think it's quite a contribution.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.800
It really highlights all the work that's being done in 3.11.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.780
So well done.

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.180
All right.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.620
Now, before you get out of here, I got to ask you the final two questions.

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.380
If you're going to write some Python code, if you're going to work on specialist, what

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.360
editor do you use?

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.440
I use VS Code.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:57.980
Okay.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:58.400
Right on.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.980
And then notable PyPI package, something you came across, like, oh, this thing is cool.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.900
Maybe not the most popular, but something that you want to give a shot at.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:06.020
Yeah.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:06.860
I thought about this.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.040
Can I say two?

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.120
Is it only limited?

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:09.600
Two is fine.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:09.860
Okay.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.020
Cool.

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.040
So there's two.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.900
I really like creative packages that kind of blur the line between like, what is Python

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:16.800
and what isn't.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.160
Okay.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.540
So the first one is called PyMetal 3, PyMTL 3.

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:21.620
This is so cool.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.860
It allows you to design hardware using Python.

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:24.920
Interesting.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.240
Okay.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:30.760
And you can basically design everything from just a small, you know, set of logic gates

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.860
to a full chip, then export it to Verilog.

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:34.980
You run it on an FPGA.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:37.920
And, you know, this is kind of my hardware background coming through.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.060
Right, right, right.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:39.500
Yeah.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:43.480
My brother is actually studying at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo right now.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:48.240
And he is on a research team that's designing an entire processor in Python.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:53.840
And so basically the processor itself is designed in Python and you can test it with Python.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.220
So they're testing with hypothesis.

01:02:55.660 --> 01:03:01.020
And it's a really cool, creative way of kind of doing this sort of stuff.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:01.340
Yeah.

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:04.300
You don't need any special hardware to make it happen either, right?

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.220
Yeah, exactly.

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:09.380
You can just run it on your local machine and now you've got a RISC-V chip running.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.560
Nice.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:10.980
Yeah.

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:16.040
So the other one is another kind of cool, weird, low-level hardware package.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.880
I don't know if I count this pip installable.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.780
It's called PeachPy.

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:23.580
I don't know how well maintained it is, but you have to do that thing where you tell pip

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.380
to install from like a GitHub link.

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:26.160
All right.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.280
Well, you can pip install from a GitHub link.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.280
You got to give it a really weird URL instead of just the name.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:32.820
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:33.040
Okay.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:33.440
Got it.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:33.640
Sure.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.160
And so this is super cool.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.020
It's an x86-64 assembler in Python.

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:39.500
Okay.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:46.280
So with this, you can basically implement a compiler or if you like it, a just-in-time

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.900
compiler for basically x86 hardware.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:55.100
So what this allows you to do is in your Python code, it takes care of doing things like allocating

01:03:55.100 --> 01:04:01.300
hardware registers and labeling jumps and all that sort of stuff, calling conventions.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:06.520
And so you can specify exactly what assembly instructions you want to execute, assemble them,

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:11.620
and then it will package them up in a Python function object and you can call your assembly

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.600
code from Python, which I think is so cool.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:13.920
Wow.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.880
And it actually executes as assembly instructions?

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:17.600
Yes.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:17.940
Yeah.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.240
So it's like faults and everything.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:19.620
Yeah.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:20.860
Yeah, of course.

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.500
It's the most common thing it does.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:22.940
Yeah.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:28.000
But I mean, like a simple example, you can pass in a Pyaltic pointer and then add, you know,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.600
eight or 16 or whatever to get the type of it and then return that and it will return.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.420
Yeah.

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:33.800
Very cool.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:37.740
So you can see the code example on here for PeachBuy.

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:38.680
I'll put the link in the show notes.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:43.000
But you do things like create an argument and then you create a general purpose register

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.100
and you load the argument onto the register and you might call the ISA SSE4 operation or

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:49.320
whatever.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:49.840
Pretty cool.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.240
Yeah.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.160
Two really good ones.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:51.640
All right.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.440
Final call to action.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.320
People are interested in specialist and exploring the specializing adaptive interpreter.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.080
What do you tell them?

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:02.180
I think the most important thing you can do is download or if you're feeling like it,

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.500
build Python 3.11 and try running it for yourself.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.720
See if your code gets faster.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.480
It probably will.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.120
If it doesn't, then specialists could help show you where it's not.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.240
And if that is surprising to you, then you could report it to us.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:22.040
You know, if like, oh, my code got slower for some reason, you know, and it looks like

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.060
this specific pattern, what's causing it.

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.360
That's something that we care about.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.640
Yeah, I suspect this interpreter is something that's never done.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.300
It's clear you could always add more cases.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:37.580
You could make it decide sooner or easier or more accurately when and how to specialize and

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.300
add more by.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.020
There's like a lot of stuff you could do, right?

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.900
As opposed to, well, yeah, now you read CSV files.

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.080
That part is done.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:44.660
Yeah.

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:48.700
And again, if you're feeling up to it and you've got a huge pure Python app, you can

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.020
even compile with stats and dump that out and take a peek at it.

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:56.000
I think you showed our repository earlier where we have our issue tracker, where we kind

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.020
of just spitball ideas and keep track of work in progress.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:05:59.780
Yeah, this one.

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:01.080
If you go to the issue tracker here.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.200
Sorry, I was wrong.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.200
And the ideas one.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:03.400
Yeah.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:07.700
So you've got it's faster dash CPython slash ideas on GitHub.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:07.940
Yeah.

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:10.280
So if you go to issues there, that's all our work in progress.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:15.420
And if you have experience optimizing dynamic languages or if you see a cool research paper

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:20.900
something that you want us to know about opening issue here and where things get done.

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:21.280
Yeah.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:21.880
Fantastic.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.580
Well, thank you for making Python faster.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.720
I think it's really, really important.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:31.740
I mean, I'm always a little bit conflicted because I have some pretty complicated web apps

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:35.360
that get a decent amount of traffic and they've been fine, like really, really fine.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.740
You know, handful of milliseconds response time.

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:42.520
I mean, they're doing all sorts of madness with databases and HTML and all kinds of stuff.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.860
So on one hand, I don't know if I need Python to be faster, but on the other, people are

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:50.080
deciding which language they're going to choose and where they can do their work.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:56.300
And sometimes either perceived or real reasons, people think Python is not fast enough.

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:56.700
Right.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:01.320
And so this is important work that will really help some people and will help the community

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:01.840
to be stronger.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.560
So thank you.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.060
We love Python program.

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.220
Right on.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:05.720
Right on.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:05.940
Cool.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:07.860
Well, thank you so much for being here.

01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:08.840
It's great to chat with you.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.020
Thanks again for having me.

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:10.620
Yeah, you bet.

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:10.900
