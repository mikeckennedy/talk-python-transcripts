00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.560
Has anyone told you that you should become a data scientist?

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.500
Have you heard it's a great career?

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.020
In fact, data scientist is the best job in America according to Glassdoor's 2018 rankings.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.380
That's great, but how do you get a career in data science?

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.760
And once you've landed that first job, how do you find the right fit?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.120
How do you find the right company?

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.000
And how do you get more deeply involved with the community as you grow in that career?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.160
I've brought two great guests, both highly successful data scientists,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.920
on the show today who have been thinking deeply about this.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.260
Jacqueline Nolas and Emily Robinson are here to give you real-world,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.340
actionable advice on getting into this rewarding career.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.180
This is Talk Python To Me, episode 262, recorded Wednesday, April 22nd, 2020.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.240
Jacqueline, Emily, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.860
Thank you.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.480
Thank you.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.400
Excited to be here.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.120
I'm excited to have you both here.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.780
Really excited to talk about this topic.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.460
I think one of the things that a lot of listeners out there can benefit hugely from

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.240
is how do I get started in programming?

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.080
How do I get started in data science?

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.600
How do I get started in this overall sort of Python career?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.680
And there's so many different paths and ways you can go.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.920
You could go get a four-year degree.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.820
You could drop out of college and do a startup.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.640
What is the right path?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.180
And what is some guidance around there?

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.160
What are some of the trade-offs?

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.260
And so you both have been writing about this lately.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.240
And this is really, really good work that you're putting out.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.500
So I'm excited to talk to you both about that.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.920
Great.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.200
Yeah.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.460
So we just published our book, Build a Career in Data Science.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.880
We've been working on this, I think, almost two years now.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.220
Yeah.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.260
Two years since you reached out to me.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.820
Yeah.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.400
And so two years, a lot of work, a lot of talking to people in the field.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.620
And so it's really been great to finally get it out there and talk to people and watch people

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.300
actually get help by it.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.440
So yeah, we love talking about it.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.720
Awesome.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.780
Well, I'm really excited to have you all here to talk about it.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.120
But before we get to that, let's maybe do a little bit of a meta thing.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.040
I always ask this question on the show, but it's a bit meta this time.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.440
It's just how did you get into programming in Python?

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.620
Emily, you want to go first?

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.920
Yeah.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.780
I don't know if I can admit this on this podcast, but I actually don't program in Python

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.260
anymore.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.180
I program in R day to day.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.460
I have programmed in Python.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.020
So how I got started was back in college.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.980
I did Python in one computer science class, but most of the programming I did was in R in

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.040
the statistics program.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.900
So I was lucky enough to go to Rice University when Hadley Wickham was a professor there who,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.440
for your listeners who don't use R, is a very famous R programmers, contribute a lot of

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.760
the big packages to it.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.180
So that's how I got started.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.480
And I kept doing it in grad school, which I got my master's in organizational behavior.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.200
After that, I went to a data science bootcamp called Metis, which was all in Python.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.820
So, you know, sort of up my Python skills there and then got started working in data science

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.280
and industry.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.300
Yeah, very cool.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.480
Declan, how about you?

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.800
Okay.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.700
So like Emily, most of my work is in R, although I do some Python too.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.460
But okay.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.120
So my background, I did an undergrad and master's in math.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.900
And then like, I really want to help companies use math to solve problems.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.860
This is before the term data science existed.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.700
So I went out in industry, did some what is now data science, but I didn't know it at the

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.960
time.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.220
Went and got a PhD because I wanted to get some more technical skills.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.940
And then now I work as a consultant helping out companies.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.220
Awesome.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.100
What's your PhD in?

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.020
Industrial engineering.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.320
Yeah.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.360
But actually, so how I actually started using Python, I think the first Python project I

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.140
ever did was there's a style of games from like the 80s called roguelikes, where you have

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.680
like your little asterisk symbol and you're walking around like the computer screen trying

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.760
to fight monsters and stuff.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.180
And like the monster might be the letter M.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.120
And I wanted to make one of these.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.600
It's like a mud, but it has like some visual representation.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.060
Okay.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.360
Yeah.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.640
Awesome.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.860
Yeah.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.280
And so it just like, it gets weirder.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.080
So I wanted to make one of these and I wanted to make one of like when you're on a river and

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.480
you're like tubing and you're sitting there, I want your character, your little ad symbol

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.220
to be like you floating around the river and you like see horses and stuff.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.380
So anyways, Python was the language that had the most straightforward library for making

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.820
one of these roguelike games.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.800
And so I spent like two weeks coding up this tubing simulator and then I got bored of the

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.520
project and left it.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.500
But that was my first time actually using Python.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.200
Yeah, it's cool.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.440
And these little personal projects are super valuable for getting into programming because

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.140
you just go through and say, well, I'm learning about loops.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.780
So I'm going to write like some different kind of loops.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.340
Like no one learns that way, right?

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.320
Not really.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.900
Yeah.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.240
So that's one of the chapters in our book.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.960
We have a whole chapter on, hey, you know, it's really good to learn things this way.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.920
And you can actually make a portfolio of projects that you then can use to help

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.720
you get a job.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.700
And for me, one of the, besides making tubing simulators, one of the projects I actually

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.300
did was to learn neural networks.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.680
I generated a neural network that would create offensive license plates that would get banned

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.920
by the state of Arizona because I had a data set of all these license plates.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.060
And that ended up being the basis for like an extremely valuable consulting project where

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.780
I ended up doing natural language processing using the same stuff I learned from that offensive

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.600
license plate thing.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.580
That is so cool.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.560
It's just such a fun and playful and kind of silly project.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.460
But then, yeah, what I found really interesting in programming in general is you have these

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.580
two different realms, you know, like think hedge fund or Air Force, right?

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.120
But the fundamental thing you learn and the skills you gain to solve or work in those areas, it's

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.620
almost exactly the same.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.500
It's just like, what layer is the specialty that they're working in?

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.780
You know, how do you work with trading?

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.380
They care maybe more about like timing versus, I don't know, visualization or whatever.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.000
But it's blown my mind like how similar stuff is like that.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.860
Like I created this fun thing for license plates.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.540
And then it turns out to actually let me, I don't know what exact project you were working

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.400
on, but like something that obviously was probably not that, right?

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.420
It was a real thing someone paid me for as opposed to a license plate thing which gets me some blog post

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.720
views.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.000
Yeah.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.220
Just a very short side note.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.960
Did you see that somebody thought they were going to be so, so clever and get out of all

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.160
the camera, like camera speed traps and stuff that red lights, red light cameras and whatnot.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.660
So they got their license plate to say null, N-U-L-L.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.560
And they thought like that would just trigger the database to think nothing was there.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.840
But they started getting tickets for every faulty piece of data that was in.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.080
Oh, no.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.040
There was nobody, like there wasn't a license plate properly.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.000
It was null.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.300
So they started getting thousands of dollars of tickets that weren't theirs, but that was,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.980
they're now registered for null, like across the board.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.900
It's upstate.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.180
I care.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.120
Playing with fire.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.880
Oh, that backfired bad.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.780
Anyway, that sounds really, really fun.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.720
So Emily, what are you doing today?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.280
Like day to day, what do you work on?

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.600
Yeah.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.840
So I work as a senior data scientist at Warby Parker, which makes eyeglasses and out contacts

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.320
as well.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.640
You can get online and well, you could in previous times get in stores as well.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.820
But that, of course, like many other companies, we've closed all our retail stores at the moment.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.100
Yeah.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.060
We have a Warby Parker here in Portland and I almost went in it the other day, but not anymore.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.300
Yeah.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.200
But still online, right?

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.460
Yeah.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.080
Still online.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.580
Still online.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.060
Yeah.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.880
So I joined there in December.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.360
So about five months ago now on the data science team, which is a centralized team that works

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.580
with departments across the company.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.380
So that's been really fun because previously I'd always been a data scientist that was embedded

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.040
with a team.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.140
So when I worked at Etsy, the analytics department was centralized, but we were sort of paired with

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.060
one partner team.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.560
So I worked with search my whole time.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.300
And then my last job, I was part of the growth team.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.400
So I reported to the VP of growth, not to the chief data scientist.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.360
So this has been a new experience being on a fully centralized team where for one month I

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.660
might work with finance.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.160
And then a couple months later, I'm working with product strategy.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.220
That sounds super fun.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.620
And you get to experience different kinds of problems and work with different teams

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.100
and technologies, I'm sure.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:18.880
Yeah, exactly.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.120
And so, you know, and the team tackles a wide range of projects.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.820
So one thing we discussed in our book, right, is data science is a pretty broad field.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.860
And so there's lots of different projects you can do.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:34.080
So some of ours are making like a dashboard to view analytics and some other ones may be more

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.560
modeling problems or making machine learning product.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.560
So that's been really interesting to get this breadth of things that we can work on depending

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.480
on what the team we're working with needs.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.640
Yeah, sounds super cool.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.820
Jacqueline, how about you?

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.440
I'm working as an independent consultant.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.520
So I've spent the last couple of years working, you know, as my own company.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.420
So helping out big companies like T-Mobile, Expedia, some smaller startups in the Seattle area.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.700
And so this is pretty fun because, you know, like Emily was saying, by being a consultant,

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.800
I got to work on all sorts of different projects, whether it's taking machine learning models

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.840
and pulling them into production or helping a company figure out who are the most like active,

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.760
engage customers and how to, you know, think about targeting them differently.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.780
So that's pretty great.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:19.060
Unfortunately, it is not like the best time to be a consultant on your own right now.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.800
You know, it's been a little dicey lately, but all in all, I've really enjoyed getting

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.300
to work with all these big companies on all these different interesting data science problems.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.580
Yeah, it sounds really fun.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.460
And it is nice to be able to pick who you want to work with and what projects you want

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:31.920
to take.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.580
And you have a lot, a little more freedom, I think, to kind of go your own way.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.120
But right now, I don't know, all bets are off.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.580
It's yeah, I think it's tricky to be a freelancer right now because you feel it, all these changes

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.260
and all these pressure, you feel it immediately.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.100
Right.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.200
But if you work at, I don't know, some large company, you might not feel it right away,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.540
but then, you know, maybe that company goes under and then all of a sudden you don't have

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.240
all the connections you had as a freelancer.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:58.920
Right.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.120
Maybe Expedia dries up well because travels down, but, you know, maybe some other companies

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.360
like, hey, we got some more work.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.560
Why don't you come work for us?

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:06.760
Right.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.420
Whereas if you work at a company, you don't necessarily cultivate those connections as

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:11.640
much.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:11.940
Yeah.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.360
And I think a lot of people tend to like, kind of make working as a freelancer, kind of like

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.620
a, like a cool thing that like, oh, when you're really a big shot, you get to like work, you

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.820
know, just as an independent consultant.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.620
But it's, so I think a lot of people kind of like aspire to have that sort of a job, but

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.940
it's really hard.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.740
It's really hard because as you're saying, there's a lot of instant, you know, if there are changes

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:31.960
in the market, you feel it instantly.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.980
And, you know, half of your job is going out and finding new clients.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.980
Making deals, trying to like work with stakeholders.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.540
None of that has to do with programming or technical stuff, right?

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.040
You've got a, you're almost in marketing for yourself as a bit.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.360
Right.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.340
So like people think, oh, I want to be a freelancer.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.080
So I don't have to do all the boring stuff.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.700
I can just do the data science.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.480
And it's like, no, you actually have to do more of the boring stuff.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.500
So it's, we actually, we have a chapter in our book about, okay, what do you do once you

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.880
become like a senior data scientist and you're looking at the next steps.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.860
And one of the paths we've discussed is the consultant path, which has some perks to it, but also

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.560
have some serious risks and downsides.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:07.800
Yeah.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.860
I also have to share.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:14.200
So how we split writing the book was we each like, were the primary writer for half the

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.760
chapters and the other person edited it.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.620
And so Jacqueline was writing this chapter she was just talking about.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.720
And the first version of the independent consultant one was so negative.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.140
Like she was basically like, never do this.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.920
I'm like, Jacqueline, I think we need to like pull back a little bit.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.960
Like, I understand.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.340
You definitely want to share the cons.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:36.300
Well, it's not that, yeah, it's not that I think consulting is a bad thing to do.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.040
It's that I've had so many people come up to me and be like, oh, that sounds so cool.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.820
I want to do that.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.560
How do I do that?

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:48.560
And I feel like I'm the, like the old woman in front of the cave, like, you know, I think

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.940
I've even came a little too hard, but yeah.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.820
Careful what you wish for.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.580
You might get it.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.280
How funny.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.900
Yeah, it's, it definitely has this aura of like, hey, you're your own boss.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.540
You can just do whatever.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.260
But yeah, there's, there's a lot of work to be done there.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.180
And I think it also makes sense at different stages in your career, for sure.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:13.240
Let's start this whole conversation off with a question about how you both got your first

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.660
job.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.400
So I heard about what you're doing now.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.100
And I have this theory.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.580
I've only really tested it.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.620
I guess I've tested with a few people.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.560
I was going to say, I really only tested with myself because I only know my career that

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.020
well, but I've, I work with some people who are interns and then found their way through

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.380
like really successful stuff and sort of saw that as well.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:39.200
And my theory is in the developer data science space, the first job is the hardest.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.540
Because once you've had one job, you have a portfolio of work, you have experience, you

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.860
can say, I've done this thing and you have a problem similar to like, here, I've done this

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.680
thing with license plates.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.840
It's technically not license plates, but that's basically what you're asking to do.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.860
So it's not a matter of convincing a person in an interview who can do it because you

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.280
can just show them, look, this is what I built and they're happy.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.980
But in the very beginning, it's such an unknown people.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:09.580
So I think getting that first job is probably like one of the biggest steps to kind of going

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.380
down this path.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.100
So I wanted to ask you too, how'd you get your first jobs?

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.520
Emily, you want to go first?

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:14.780
Yeah.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.300
So I mentioned my first job was Etsy.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.100
And so, all right.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.500
So it's like take a time machine back to fall 2016.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.140
So I finished the Metis Data Science Bootcamp.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.040
But I interviewed.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.060
So like one thing they did was there was a demo day for your final project and there were

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.200
some companies hiring there.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.520
But yeah, I ended up at Etsy.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.500
And actually how I got that initial, I don't know if it would have happened anyway, but what

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.100
helped initially was I actually knew someone, Hillary Parker, used to work there as a data

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:41.580
analyst.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.100
And she had since left, but she still knew people who worked there.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.760
So she offered to introduce me to a manager there.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.760
And he took a look at my profile and said, yeah, I can refer you.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:57.100
So definitely a network is a big part of it, even for later jobs, although I definitely agree

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:57.880
the first, the hardest.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:03.540
And then I think what helped there was like Etsy was a really great company.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.740
I really enjoyed working there.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.100
And the title at the time I had was data analyst.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.100
It wasn't data scientist.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.140
And now actually that team since then, shortly after I left, their titles are now data scientists.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.840
But one thing we talk about in the book is avoiding this.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.440
People can get very attached to the title data scientists, and those can sometimes be harder

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.980
to get, or they're very attached to like, oh, I need to go work at like Google or Facebook

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.100
or Airbnb, right?

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:26.520
Like this.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.040
I would say like Etsy probably falls under there, but like, you know, very well known like data

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.760
science company.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.960
And I do think like you are going to get such valuable experience from almost like any

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.700
job.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.520
If you're working in like data and whether you're called data, data analyst or, you know,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.380
research analyst or product analyst, like if you're doing code, if you're working with data,

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.900
if you're working with stakeholders, it's that can be a really great first experience.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.560
And like you said, just having that on your resume can open up a lot more doors.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.040
And it's very common, especially in the tech field for people to switch jobs every, you

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.920
know, one to three years.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.660
So it's not like you're signing up there forever.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.660
That's how I got my first job.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.400
Yeah, cool.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.660
And one of the things I want to talk to you all about is the trade-offs of different types

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.660
of companies to work at, but we'll get to that.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:15.780
I do think this idea of having someone to introduce you or someone who knows you or someone who knows

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.580
someone, you know, like a couple of layers removed is really valuable.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.640
When I was working at companies where we were doing a lot more hiring, it was,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.480
does anybody know somebody who can do this and they can recommend who's good?

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.540
If the answer was no, then maybe it becomes a job search.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.040
Then maybe it becomes a job posting.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.000
But it was not first a job posting.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.520
It was first, anybody knows somebody great that can do this that we're in need of.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.500
And if somebody knew somebody, then we probably just would go out and talk to them, you know,

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:43.980
first.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.340
And I don't know if that's fair or not, but that's just, it's how it works.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.940
Because if you put a job posting out there, you could get a thousand, not a thousand,

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.560
a hundred applicants.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.660
You've got to go through.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:59.500
And, you know, I've had plenty of people I've interviewed where it's like, I can do this

00:15:59.500 --> 00:15:59.740
thing.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.260
Like, okay, how about this?

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.520
How about we turn on screen sharing?

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.660
And what was it at the time?

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.900
It was like, go to a meeting or something.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.140
I turn on screen sharing.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.420
And why don't you just write a real simple program that does that?

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.640
It should be like five lines of code.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.880
Anyone could do it.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.220
Who's like, couldn't do it.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.780
You're like, okay, you clearly have not been doing this for two years because this

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.620
would be like the first week of a class that covered this topic.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.940
So, you know, it's just, it's really tricky.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.700
So I do think, you know, just people out there listening, like cultivate those connections

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.400
as much as possible, even if it's not, it's not a perfect meritocracy, but that's just the

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:31.800
way it is.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:31.980
Right.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.260
Yeah.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.960
And I mean, I think there's lots of advantages to a network beyond like helping get a job.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.340
It's like finding a community of other people who are having like, maybe if you're the only

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.720
data scientist at a company.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.520
And like you said, I mean, it's partly when you sort of said like, maybe not thousands.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.440
I mean, certainly the large companies get like thousands or tens of thousands of applications

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.100
for a data science position.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.820
I remember Angela Bassa, who's one of our interviewees in the book, she posted, I'm not

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.520
sure it was data science, maybe it was a data analyst position at our company.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.200
And she actually closed it after four days because they'd gotten a thousand applications.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.760
I've got a backlog.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.880
We're just going to have to go through this.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.080
Yeah.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:05.480
Yeah.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:05.720
Yeah.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:12.500
This portion of talk Python to me is brought to you by Kite, the smart AI powered autocomplete

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.300
for your editor.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.340
As developers, our choice of editor is central to our work.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:22.100
The more powerful and effective that that editor is, the more effective that you are.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.000
That's why I'm excited about Kite.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.400
Kite is a free plugin for your code editor that gives you ML powered autocompletions and

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:29.860
documentation.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.800
Chances are it works with your editor of choice.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:38.440
Even if that editor has existing autocomplete features, the list includes PyCharm, VS Code,

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.560
Atom, Sublime, Vim, and more.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.540
And Kite runs locally.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.340
So your code is private with no cloud or internet connection necessary.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.280
And the Kite is 100% free.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.400
So try it today at talkpython.fm/Kite.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.660
Kite, K-I-T-E.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.480
And CL Kite can help you be more effective with your Python code.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.060
Declan, how'd you get your first job?

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.380
Okay.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:05.240
So first off, I feel old because I was like, oh, in 2016.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.580
So my story starts in 2008.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.440
So I was finishing my master's in math.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.800
And so, you know, because it was much earlier in this whole field.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.040
Again, data science wasn't really a term yet.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.140
So it was much harder to just like, you know, I remember going to like monster.com and searching

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.720
mathematician and getting just lots of math jobs.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.840
I'm like, I don't, that's not what I want.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.020
Like I don't want to be an actuary and I don't want to teach math.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.360
So what do I, what can I do?

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360
Yeah, I had no idea.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.180
Well, and I knew there were jobs out there.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.060
I just didn't know how to find them.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.920
And one of my very good friends had just started the year before working at a company.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.040
And he's like, oh, you know, we actually have a department that hires people with math degrees.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.160
You should apply.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.520
And so I applied and the interview process was like a two-day thing where they bring you on

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.140
site and they do a bunch of interviews.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.020
And so at that point in my, by my master's, I had some internships.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.600
I had some research projects.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.400
So to your point of like, it's hard when you haven't had a first job before.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.620
I think you can have things like internships or like, you know, that license plate or,

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.020
you know, any like project you can hang a hat on is something you can talk about.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.020
So I had some of that.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.660
Yeah, that's cool.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:09.920
And I do think actually now is even easier than back then with stuff like GitHub and open source.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:15.560
You don't have to be, you know, employed to create a cool project that people can start

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.140
to like or share or something.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:17.340
Right.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.080
So the opportunities are certainly there.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.340
Right.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.680
And I think that compared to before when I was doing it, no one knew what like an analytics

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.980
person needed for skills.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.520
Was it math?

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.120
Was it programming?

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.640
Now we've really got a much better idea of what you need to have on your resume.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.520
And so it's like a two day thing that ended with like a night where they took us to a bowling

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.360
alley, tried to get us to drink a lot to get more excited.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.420
I think there's a lot of ethical deviousness.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.440
Anyway, so I am just I want to let me just like just to finish the story.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.640
I ended up taking the job.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.340
And the job when they talked about it during the interview process was like, oh, you're

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.180
a, you know, analytics, business analytics team member.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.500
You're going to do forecasting.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.280
You're going to maintain the models.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.540
And I'm like, oh, cool.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.820
I've worked in forecasting before.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.880
I would love a job where I help build cool, interesting new forecasting models.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.440
And then like on the job, it came very clear that what they actually wanted me to do is rerun

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.720
the forecast each month in SAS, copy and paste it into Excel, copy and paste the chart

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.920
from Excel into PowerPoint, and then stand in front of people and read off the numbers.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.240
And that was like a huge shock because that is not what I wanted to do in a job.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.240
And it basically took me a year of working there before the job became kind of what I

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:18.820
wanted it to be.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.560
But also I had given up at that point and moved on to a different job.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:27.080
So for the people who when you do get that first job, if it is not what you expect, that's

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.500
probably, you know, I talked to a lot of people, a lot of people we interview in our book have

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.140
the same problem when they get to their first job.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.160
They're like, oh, my God, this is not what I was expecting at all.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.220
And by your second job search, you have a much better understanding of really what it is

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.940
you're looking for and what actually exists in industry versus there are no jobs.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.920
Like there's no job in industry that's just writing math theorems or whatever.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.920
That's right.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:52.860
Well, also, I think sometimes you can get into those situations because the company thinks

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.960
that's how it has to be done.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.920
Like we've done this and we need somebody to keep doing that.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.280
Like we only knew how to run Excel and then export this stuff and then do this weird thing

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.360
and then manually fix it up.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.460
And then you could tell us like what the picture says.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.220
I think that's true.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.720
Companies naturally have a tendency to that.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.720
And I think at the time coming out of a math master's, I'm like, oh, I want to do is create

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.280
new and exciting mathematical stuff.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.160
So I have this like affinity for like having to change the world on my job.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.440
Yeah.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.880
And I think, you know, I have since then in my career done a lot of good by constantly coming

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.340
up with new forecasts and new methods of doing things.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:31.060
But also it is totally fine to have a job where you spend 80% of it just pressing go again.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.700
And then the 20% doing something interesting if you like that.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.100
Right.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.660
Like, so there's like, I think I kind of like held my nose up against those kinds of jobs,

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.920
but I think they're pretty good.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.440
I've hired people on teams.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.180
I've had a lot of people who come straight from academia have the same problem I had.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.060
Like, oh, wow.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.680
You want me to copy and paste each number like individually?

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.040
That could take me 10 minutes.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.080
Like, you know.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.200
It's got to get done.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.740
Well, my thought was, you know, maybe the job starts out that way, but then you're like,

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.420
well, I can, I can do some program.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.820
We actually, we don't really need to load Excel and copy and paste.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:06.560
I could use something like PyOpenXL where I could actually write code that talks to the

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.700
database and then runs a report and then just puts it in there.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.160
Right.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.860
So you could like slowly take away these manual steps by starting to create like cool pipelines

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.500
of like processing and automation.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:21.160
And they didn't ask anyone to do that because they thought that was basically impossible.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:21.680
Right.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.280
And so I feel like a lot of people can end up in these situations where there's like

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:31.800
one workflow that you are hired for, but you, you know, as people who can write code, we're

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.080
kind of magicians, right?

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:38.520
They can kind of like magic stuff into existence and you can solve some of these problems and

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.660
they would probably much rather have a single button click or something that's automatic every

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.640
day, but they just, they couldn't create it or put it in place.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:45.920
Yep.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.660
I think that's true.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.260
And I think depending on the different size company, you may get more opportunities to

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:50.620
do that.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.060
And depending on your appetite of, I want to code an interesting thing in Python to try

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.180
and automate the Excel or I'll just press Excel.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.120
I'll hit, I'll hit go for five minutes each day.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:22:59.940
That's fine.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.340
Exactly.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:00.840
Yeah.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.880
I do think that's where the company culture or your manager can be important though, right?

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.880
Cause I can imagine some companies that like have a lot of bureaucracy would just be

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.340
very uncomfortable with this idea.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.480
They're like, no, we've always done it this way.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.860
Or maybe like companies that are like, or the government or like companies that work with

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.260
the government.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.780
So I do think like, it's important to be, and that also kind of the reason we wrote

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:25.200
this book was because, you know, we felt there's a lot of technical guidance out there, but not

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.060
on these other really important skills you need.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:31.280
And I do think, you know, one of those skills, if you want to change the practice of a company,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.300
you can't necessarily just be like, you know, email it to them one day and have that be done.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.980
You need to like, you know, talk to them, figure out their, like, you know, what kind of scares

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.840
them about this change, like do change management and other things.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.540
And I think that's like, to not underestimate the importance of things like communication

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:51.680
and, and working with stakeholders when thinking of things like technological solutions, even

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.840
if to you, it may seem really obvious that like, oh, of course this is like going to be a hundred

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.480
percent better.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.360
Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:01.080
And Jacqueline, just to make you feel better, I got my first programming job when I was in

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.420
1997 when I was working on my PhD in math.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.460
So, you know, you can always go farther back.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.200
All right.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:18.980
Well, one of the interesting things that you discussed was that there's this term data science,

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:24.940
but in a sense, there's almost like three branches of data science, kind of a little bit like in

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.400
software development, you'd say, hey, I'm a programmer.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.600
I'm like, oh, cool.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.560
Could you build me a mobile app?

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.420
Like, no, I have no idea how to build you a mobile app.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.400
I could build you a website.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.500
And then someone else would go, I can't build a website, but I build a cool desktop app.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:36.740
Right.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.920
So, you know, what does that kind of partitioning look like in the data science space?

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.240
Yeah.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:41.880
Who wants to jump in?

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.100
So, you know, and this is something that could be like one of the more controversial parts of

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:46.420
the books.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:51.160
But I think like we people sort of come around to this, but how we divided it is in three areas,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.920
which is analytics, machine learning and decision science.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:00.320
And for example, one company that basically has this division and they wrote a great post on this

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.420
at Airbnb is Airbnb does analytics, machine learning, and they call it inference instead of decision

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:05.940
science.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:11.060
But the idea behind this is analytics is basically like taking data and putting it in front of the

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:11.600
right people.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:16.300
So just sort of showing the data that you maybe already have or going out, like maybe

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.900
going out and collecting it, but basically just, you know, maybe by making dashboards or showing

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.700
a report is just surfacing data to the right people, which is really valuable.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.080
And then the next one, machine learning, is I think often what people think of when they

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.760
think of data science, which are things like, you know, creating the recommendation model on

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.040
amazon.com, right?

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.600
When you look at a product and it says like, you know, you may like these products or at Etsy,

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.500
we have the search ranking team, which is when you search Harry Potter, what of the 200,000

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.820
Harry Potter items do you show first, right?

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.700
And they don't pick randomly.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.060
There's an algorithm that's based off of historical, how the items have behaved historically.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.200
And then the final one is decision science.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.860
So this is basically going beyond the numbers to help companies or people make decisions.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:06.840
And also generally involves a lot of statistics because basically it's, we need to understand

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.420
how to quantify uncertainty.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:13.660
So even though we know, for example, that, you know, the people who answered this, we

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.880
ran a survey and, you know, 80% of people said this.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.540
Well, but we had a 50% non-response rate and maybe we know that more women than men didn't

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:22.920
respond.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.160
So how do we adjust for that?

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.200
What's the uncertainty around this estimate?

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.700
Making a forecast, you know, as Jacqueline talked about, like that's decision science,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.580
you know, there.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.360
So those are the three main areas we have.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:33.620
Right.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.020
Our mailing list already is like skewed towards this audience.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.700
And if we just ask the mailing list, hey, everybody, tell us what you think.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:47.040
It's going to carry that bias forward or that slant forward unless we can somehow do more

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.060
to take care of it and whatnot.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.340
Right.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.180
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:49.880
And yeah.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.940
Anything to add there, Jacqueline?

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.280
Yeah.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.280
I would just say that I think a lot of people have like a preconceived notion that like one

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.840
of these types is more pure or like one of these types is like the better.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.360
Yeah.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.580
And I'm sure it's a real data scientist, not the ones who use Excel.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.120
Exactly.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:03.720
To get the title.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.580
And it's like, you can see it in stacked overflow posts.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.080
You can see it a lot in LinkedIn posts.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.200
Like there's a lot of this idea.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:10.540
Probably a lot on Reddit.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.280
Yeah.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:11.720
Oh, yeah.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.120
Oh, God.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.440
Yeah.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.160
I said I was going Reddit data science, but like, yeah, there's definitely can be this

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.940
culture of like, you're not a real data scientist.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.260
Like if you don't do machine learning.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.120
Just real quick, I'll give you the pitch for why I think each one of these has the right

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.740
to be great and like, isn't the best one.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.660
So, okay.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.380
So I think the reason why people like the machine learning the best is you're like, oh, cool.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.260
I get to use, you know, real time inferences.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.360
I get to actually help.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.840
So like a customer, when they go on their website, they actually, what happens to them depends

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.220
on what my algorithm did.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.060
And like, it's pretty cool to be able to say that like, I actually improved everyone's outcome.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.380
So my car drives down the street by itself.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:47.900
Yeah.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.120
Everyone can see that.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.940
The decision scientist, you got to be like the company's detective, right?

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.320
Like the CEO, like, like high level people can come up to you and be like, yo, I have

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:56.920
this question.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.920
Can you figure it out?

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.060
And you get to like put on your detective hat and go into data and really try and come

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:01.760
up with an answer.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.400
So yeah, you get to like play detective.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.980
And the kind of like analysis, the analyst role.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:12.220
It's great because it's like those other two roles, your things can go terribly wrong, right?

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.420
You're, you're, you can be a detective and not find the killer.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.040
Your machine learning model can ruin things for customers.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.460
Like things can go catastrophically wrong.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.560
Being an analyst, you're just here to help things.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.860
You know, you're helping, you're keeping the company going.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.720
It's like a more relaxed.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.800
You're giving advice, but you're not making the decision.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.780
Just this is what we, we found.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.440
Yeah.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:33.040
So it's like, yeah, it's like, it's helping everything run more effectively without the

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.060
like incredible amounts of stress of trying to get things right that the, you know, or trying

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.720
to build new questions, you know, research and development things that you have in the other

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.100
two fields.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.720
So it's like more of a relaxed, but enjoyable job.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.660
I'd also say like, so often there's so much low hanging fruit in the analytics side of

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.540
like things that companies aren't looking at that would really change their decisions if

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.820
you just surface these numbers.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.420
And plus, like, I think sometimes people can look down and it's like, oh, that's like easy.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.720
Like you're not using, you know, stats or machine learning.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:05.460
Well, it's actually, you know, it can be really hard to like pull the right data sometimes to

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.020
understand when someone's asking you the question, like, hey, can you, oh, there was a great

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.980
tweet yesterday where someone is like, you know, stakeholder, like, can you pull this data for me?

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.280
And you're, you know, and you're like, yeah, sure.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.860
Let me just pull from, you know, select star from ideal and pristine table that you think

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.700
somehow exists.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:26.520
And there's actually a lot of work to elicit the true question they're asking.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.500
So I'm probably underlying all of this is data wrangling.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:29.900
Yeah.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:34.880
I think all of the people have to do data wrangling and it's really just a skill like data wrangling.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.940
I think trying to be able to explain what is happening in the data, like, so kind of the

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.680
input and output.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.580
Like you really need all, you need that for all three of these jobs.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.600
So if you don't, if you're not comfortable taking data, trying to figure out, like, you

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.260
know, put it in a way that you can then use it.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.880
And if you, you aren't comfortable looking at some numbers and trying to say like, oh, well,

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.840
this number plus this number really means that any of these three jobs is going to be more

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.120
difficult.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:56.400
Yeah.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.360
How much does knowing how to talk to databases matter?

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.740
Like writing SQL queries or things like that?

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.380
Or can you get away without that?

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.180
It really matters.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.920
Even so the, I see, I would say,

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.580
the SQL ideas I've seen show up in every data science job.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.840
And I mean, I don't know.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.360
I haven't seen every data science job, but everyone I have seen.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.220
There's that one that only works with CSVs, but besides that one.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.940
But even if you don't actually work directly with SQL, the idea of taking two CSVs and joining

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:26.940
them somehow together and then filtering out the rows, like because so much of the data

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:31.500
in the world is stored in a tabular format, you really have to think, like understand how

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.440
SQL and like relational databases work.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.280
And if you don't actually know exact SQL syntax, that's fine.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.280
Like maybe, you know, the pandas, whatever, or the RDPly or whatever.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.320
But like the just concept of thinking through tables is like, yeah, you need it everywhere.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:44.640
Yeah.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.960
Emily, what do you think about that?

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.240
Yeah.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.300
I would definitely say it's, it's one of the foundational skills.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.860
And the good thing is like the basics of SQL, you can pick up pretty quickly, like just

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.980
like how to select from a table.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.800
And then, you know, you can grow as needed, you know, maybe if the data engineer is helping

00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.560
you out.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.420
But, you know, of course, if you can't, if you can't access any data, you probably can't

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.320
do much data science.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.260
Yeah.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.680
That's a really good way to put it.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.420
But also that's not a hard skill.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.280
I mean, it's not really a hard skill to learn.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.020
Like, yeah.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.260
It seems weird and hard if you've never seen it, right?

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.420
Like, how do I connect to it?

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.520
This connection string is really complicated.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:17.780
Yeah.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:18.360
But you're right.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.500
It's not a big deal.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.980
It's just something you got to learn.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:26.320
Now, I guess thinking of these three different types, it's one of the things that struck me

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.360
and you pointed out one, there's two things.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:36.020
One was that the machine learning role is probably a little more computer science-y because you're

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.880
taking code and you're putting it into production and it's real time.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:45.060
You're probably fitting in with APIs that other people are talking to and you're building stuff

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.080
that machines talk to.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.100
Is that accurate?

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:47.760
What do you think?

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.020
I would say that the machine learning is more computer science-y.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:51.320
Yes.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:51.920
A hundred percent.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:56.860
You do really need to understand things like unit testing or load testing in ways that the

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.440
decision scientists and the other roles don't necessarily need as much.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:31:59.660
Right.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.540
HTTP status codes and JSON and all that potentially, right?

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:02.820
Yeah.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.800
The risk of the machine learning engineer is that that actually becomes the risk.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.280
The risk is if you're not careful, your job could just become software engineering.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.380
I know a lot of machine learning engineers who, well, their company doesn't have that much

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.040
machine learning engineering to do at the moment.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.720
So you're just going to be a software engineer and then that's not great.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:22.220
But the converse is as a decision scientist, you have much more stats and like just building

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.480
the actual like models.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.120
But if you don't have the work to do as a decision scientist, there's not reports, you know,

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.900
not super interesting models to build and questions to answer.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:35.360
You might end up just doing dashboards or something that, you know, like any of these jobs kind

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.660
of have a risk of falling into something you don't like.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.260
It's just a question of which way does the rock fall down the mountain or whatever.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.180
I don't know if that's a real metaphor, but.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.260
Some mountains.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:50.180
So another thought that I had while we were talking about this is different.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:55.080
The people in these different groups will have massively different exposure to like the

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.900
C-suite or the decision makers of the company at a high level.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:02.560
I'm thinking of a large company, like 500 people or more, not like a startup.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:09.080
But, you know, the analysis person could easily get called in front, you know, for like a board

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.160
meeting to help them decide, you know, how are things are going.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:17.720
Maybe the decision scientist, it's not so likely the machine learning developer is like, well,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.300
they've decided and then they were told you're going to build this model and here's what they're

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:21.720
hoping for.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:21.860
Right.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.800
It's, it's a different kind of, you would still be working with a lot of technical people,

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.200
but you have like different ways to grow within the company, I guess.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.940
Is that a good way to think of it?

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.280
Yes.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:37.100
I think that is absolutely the case that if you're in this, if you're an analyst or a decision

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.520
scientist, then you are much more likely to get to go to a CEO, like go in that meeting

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.480
and show some interesting data that can prove something.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:47.920
If you're a machine learning engineer, usually you are building a product, like Emily was

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.560
saying, like you're building a recommendation engine.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.800
And then there's some product person whose job it is just to be in charge of that product

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.400
and they get to go and have to see.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:59.480
You only go to the C-suite if you're going to be like raked over the coals because you

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.700
wrecked it with your machine learning.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.740
I recommend it wrong.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:06.400
But that being said, I think a lot of people who are sufficiently technical are like, oh,

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.580
I wouldn't want to do decision science.

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.280
I really want to do machine learning because I don't want to have to deal with like convincing

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:10.700
people.

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.860
I just want to have to deal with cool data modeling or whatever, you know, machine learning

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:15.120
modeling.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:19.220
But it turns out that as Emily is saying, to do those jobs well, you still have to be able

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.360
to talk to the software engineers and the data scientists who built the model and the product

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.440
person who needs to know if the recommendation is going to be good enough for the customer.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.660
Like you still have to do lots of talking to be good at it.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.320
It's just that it is less of a core tenant than it is of perhaps some of the other roles.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:32.580
Yeah.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.140
How does this affect early stage careers?

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:35.500
Right.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:41.780
Like I can, I can see somebody who like Emily in 2017 just came out of a bootcamp and

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.740
they said, okay, you're going to go talk to the CEO of Etsy and the board and like help

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.280
them with this product.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.440
You'd be like, oh my goodness.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.580
Like what have I gotten myself into?

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.920
Like that would on one hand be awesome, but also terrifying.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:56.260
Do they fit better at different stages of careers or does that really matter?

00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.400
I think it probably doesn't matter as much because like for a company that's big enough

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.500
for that prospect to be kind of terrifying, like if my last company was a startup, so like

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.620
I talked to the CEO all the time, but basically felt like another coworker.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.380
So yeah, for it to matter, like you're probably going to have more senior people, right?

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.020
Who, if they are going to like have someone present to the CEO, it's probably not going

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.520
to be the person who joined two months ago.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:19.280
Also, the other thing we didn't really talk about is how much you're specialized into one

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.860
of these roles does depend on the company.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:25.340
So often that's like the company size and maturity of the data science team, right?

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.600
So at certain companies, you may be like fully like a machine learning engineer, but

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.420
if you're the first data scientist at a startup, you're probably doing a mix of all of these

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.780
and you wouldn't go as in depth in any one of them, right?

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.980
Like a startup probably doesn't need someone who can handle hundreds of millions of items,

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.600
like recommendation items, like Amazon would, like you don't need that compute power, but

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.660
maybe you build like a simpler recommendation model.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.480
And then you also play detective work and you also, no one actually knows what the sales

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:50.940
number are.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.300
So you like finally make a dashboard.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:52.660
Right.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.960
You probably do a lot of growth at like an early stage startup, a lot of AB testing type

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.520
of work.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.300
Yeah, exactly.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.960
So I don't want to make it seem like, oh, every role like falls into like one and only

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.020
one of this, because you certainly can have roles where you're, where you're putting on

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.000
multiple of these hats.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.360
I would also say that not only depends on the company you work at, you may do multiple, but

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.300
also you can during your career change.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.460
I didn't do any machine learning up until like two or three years ago.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.700
And then I switched over to doing that now.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.720
So now I kind of do both, but like lots of people switch in lots of directions between

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.060
any of these three jobs.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.060
And that, that is the thing that it is possible to do.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:25.320
Yeah.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:25.940
Yeah, for sure.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:26.200
Yeah.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.320
Chapter one interview, Robert Chang is over at Airbnb is a really good case study in this.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.240
So he started more on like the analytics side and the decision science.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.180
I was working at Twitter.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.320
He then started to continue that work in Airbnb.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.260
And then he ended up switching over to do machine learning.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.960
And he actually has blogged about this.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.780
And like, as part of that process, like he did need to up his skills a bit.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:49.560
So for example, he'd previously done most of his work in R, but the teams that do machine

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.480
learning, like a lot of the libraries were built in Python.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:56.620
So he actually has a repo where he talks, where he like put his deliberate practice for Python

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.700
and how he was going to learn that over a couple months.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.500
So he can make the switch.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.000
That's cool.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:00.440
Yeah.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.260
You can definitely switch.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.160
I mean, I've definitely made big switches in my career as well, from like being terrified

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.620
of the web to only working on the web and stuff like that as well.

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:08.880
Yeah.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.960
And I would just add, oh, sorry.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.260
I would just add on that.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.420
You know, I've talked to a lot of people who have wanted to switch and had trouble because

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.040
these jobs are a resource and the company has a finite amount of them, right?

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.240
So there's some companies where they just don't have any machine learning engineering.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.120
And so if you really just would love to do machine learning engineering, you're going to be

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.800
in trouble because there's just none of those jobs available.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.600
Or as Emily points out, maybe they have a couple of them, but like people who are super

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.920
senior are already working on them.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.460
And some companies, like you're a startup and like they have way too much work they

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.380
could possibly do any of it, you know, all of it.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.640
So you can do kind of have a lot of freedom.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:45.400
And so sometimes if you want to make this transition and you're finding it difficult, you need to

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:45.860
switch companies.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:50.580

They're hiring.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.440
Go to linode.com slash careers to find out more.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.780
Let them know that we sent you.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:52.340
Speaking of companies, in your book, you have a really interesting conversation about different

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.440
kinds of companies.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.560
And I've been fascinated.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.280
I've worked at almost all of these different types.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.780
Early-stage startup, late-stage startup, probably.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.940
Mass, quite, yeah, let's go with massive tech company.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.480
But not a government contractor.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.580
I've worked sort of subcontracting with them.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.800
I've worked at most of these.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:14.860
And a lot of those experiences are not really obvious if, say, you're in a boot camp and

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.460
you're just looking for a job.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.900
You have been through the internals of these things.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:26.420
So maybe you'll give us a flyover of the five different types of companies and maybe a little

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.600
bit of example about each.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.940
What's the team like?

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.300
What's the tech like?

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.740
What are the pros and cons?

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.220
And so on.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:32.560
Sure.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:37.860
We realized very quickly that when we were writing our book that we needed some sort

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.600
of way to help people understand what is the actual job like.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:44.740
And then we're like, well, it really is so different depending on which company you're at.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.680
And so Emily and I kind of brainstormed five different companies we worked at.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.560
And then we kind of came up with goofy alternative names for them.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.260
But if you look at our LinkedIn profile, you can probably guess.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.640
Don't give it away to Emily.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:01.700
I love that you have an actual little...

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.020
custom logo for each one.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.500
Yeah, that was all Jacqueline.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.260
Yeah, and I thought about which fonts to use with which company.

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.340
Yeah, it was well done.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.080
So the five companies...

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:18.040
So we have MTC, which MTC is like your Google, your Apple, your Microsoft, these companies,

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.040
that's just like giant tech company.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.320
So they're rich.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.180
They're so big that like each part of the company uses a different type of tech.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.140
You know, so they have lots of advanced stuff.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.020
But because they're so big, you may not actually...

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.640
Your stuff may not link up with...

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.200
You know, if you're working on Google Maps, you may have nothing to do with a Google self-driving

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.080
car sort of a thing.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.660
The second company is Handbag Love, which is just some company that's like a retail company,

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:44.000
you know, like a Nordstrom, DSW, one of these companies that is big.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.900
They've been around for a while.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.820
They use data science, but that's not like their thing.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.300
But they're not a tech company.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:48.800
Right.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.720
Right.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.380
And so I really like working at those kinds of companies because you got to like go in

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.720
and really do a lot because no one's there to tell you, oh, you can't use Python.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.980
You have to use R or whatever.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:58.720
Yeah, exactly.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.700
There's no...

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.380
Like, let me talk to other software developers.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.340
There are no...

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:02.620
Yeah.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.800
There are none.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.540
Like, okay, well, I can just...

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.260
These are the problems.

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.480
Please solve it with technology.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.140
These are your requirements, right?

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:09.520
Yeah.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.380
There's no rules and restrictions.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.520
And so then we have this SegMetra company, which is like some company with like a hot new

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.480
idea for a startup.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.260
And they're...

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.100
You know, it's really just like a classic startup where it's like there's so many things

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.380
that need to be built at once that like everyone just kind of in a constant panic

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:23.680
attack.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.660
You get to do whatever you want.

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.720
So it's a lot of fun and exciting.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.420
Then there's Videory, which is like, imagine if like...

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.300
What's that company that's Vimeo?

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.840
The company that's not YouTube, right?

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.060
So like some company that's...

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:34.060
Yeah.

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.020
You know, it's a tech company.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.020
It's, you know, decent size, but it's not huge.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.020
So everyone knows each other.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:38.480
Right, right.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.460
Maybe Zoom even.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:39.900
Yeah.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.840
Like we're talking on Zoom.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.040
Could be something like that, right?

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:42.400
Yeah.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:42.720
Yeah.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.200
And then lastly, I forget what I call it.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:44.660
Some GAD.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.060
So it's basically like some giant government compactor.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.860
Geo Aerospace or something like that.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.460
Something like that.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.040
And it's basically, think of your Lockheed Martin, your Boeing.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.900
People don't, I think when they talk about data science, they usually don't think about

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.420
these companies as often, but they have tons of people like that, especially analysts.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.180
Like these companies run on that.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:05.300
And because these kind of government contracting companies are massive, they've been around for

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.660
a long time and they really don't want to make mistakes because that can cause a lot

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:09.040
of damage.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:09.760
It's just a lot.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.960
Everything moves a lot slower.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.900
There's a lot more bureaucracy.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.900
It's more of a relaxed job than working at like a startup.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.460
Yeah, sure.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:14.980
All right.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.780
So which one of you worked at the massive tech company equivalent?

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.240
I don't know if I should say, I consulted for a massive tech company equivalent.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:26.500
I'm not asking which one, just like, but you did, Jacqueline, that was you that worked

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.380
at something like this?

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.540
I worked at something like this.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:33.060
So the reason I'm asking is because I want to ask you for your take on it, right?

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.400
Like, what is the team like?

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.000
Oh.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.420
What is the tech like?

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.160
And so on, right?

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:37.860
Don't name names.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.220
Oh, no, no, no.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:38.480
Okay.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:38.800
Okay.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.220
Yeah.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:43.280
Actually, I realized I actually consulted for a couple of them, so I'm not incriminating

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:43.580
anyone.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.140
Anyway.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:49.440
So when I consulted for these companies, they're like, because they're so big, they're

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.420
so big that, you know, they may have this like big onboarding process that everyone goes

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.540
through, but it has nothing to do with your actual job because the company is too big to

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.240
do that.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.660
And then when you got on your team, it's like really specific.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.400
I recently started working with some company like this.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.000
They were working with the podcast, right?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.540
They were doing some ads and stuff.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:11.280
I had to go through and like sign a waiver that said nobody would climb on a ladder in a dangerous

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:11.900
way.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:12.220
Yeah.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:15.000
I'm like, it's a podcast recording.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:15.840
You're going to give me audio.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.960
Like, there's no ladders.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.420
I don't know.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.540
But like, this is the other one.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.820
I see a ladder in your background.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.480
I didn't know about that.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:21.680
Yeah.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.640
Actually, maybe this is what they're talking about.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:29.580
It was like the warehouse person and the like contractor who does podcasting, whatever.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.960
Like it didn't, you know, they wanted to run an ad.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.020
So I had to go through this like weird process.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:34.660
It was bizarre.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:35.000
Yeah.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.160
And so the cool thing about working with this company is they have tons of money and they're

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.200
really excited about technology.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.900
So if you're like, I want to buy this expensive thing and try building a solution using that

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.080
people are generally like, sure, whatever.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:44.560
It's fine.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.240
The bad thing is this is true for everyone else as well.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.920
So when your product A is trying to link up to product B, you may struggle a bit.

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.440
So there's just a lot of this kind of lots of tech, lots of money, high salaries, not

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.280
necessarily everything working in sync that you have to deal with.

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:58.480
Yeah.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.900
You probably get to work with a ton of smart coworkers.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:01.760
Yeah.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.960
It's a bit of a bonus and a curse, right?

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.760
It's hard to stand out probably, but it's also great to have that support.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.080
Right.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.400
And if you're a person who really likes learning from other people and like having direct

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.880
mentorship, you are, this is one of the best companies to get that out.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.040
Because yeah, like this company just draws people who know a lot of tech like a magnet.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:18.280
Yeah.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.940
So like one thing what we did is because, you know, it may be the case, like, you're

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.980
looking for jobs and like, you know, it's easy for you.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.200
Like you're thinking of finding Google.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.900
You're like, okay, that's the massive tech company.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.960
But maybe you find a job and you're like, well, it doesn't really fit into any one of

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:30.740
these five things.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.560
It's like one thing we do at the end of the chapter is we pull it together.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:33.800
Okay.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.840
Like what are some of the vectors that the companies differ on?

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.240
Right.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.740
So mentorship, bureaucracy, like the tech stack.

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:43.800
So even if you find one, you know, you have a company that's not in one of these five

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.720
archetypes, you can sort of go through those things.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.180
You say like, oh, okay, well, like it's a huge company.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.840
So like probably there's a decent amount of bureaucracy.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.320
I would be the first data scientist.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.700
There's not going to be a lot of mentorship.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:57.080
And so you can think about these different pieces and, you know, people have different

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.260
preferences, right?

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:02.560
Like some folks really, I've talked to people who really love, usually we don't, it's, I

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.200
wouldn't recommend it for someone's first job, but people who want to be the first data

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.300
scientist at the company because they want to get to build everything.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:12.080
And then there's some experienced data scientists who are like, I would never want to be the first

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.200
or the only data scientist.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.640
Like I really like working on a team.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.020
So it's not like, you know, one of these is like, you know, oh, everyone, you know, it's

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:22.480
always bad to like have these certain things, but it's just different criteria that you can

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.000
think about and reflect for yourself.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.040
Like what's important to me?

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.020
What am I looking for?

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:26.300
Yeah.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.120
What's the fit?

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:27.940
All right.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.840
So handbag, glove, who wants to talk about that one?

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.540
I can do that one too.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:32.000
All right.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.120
Just as I was talking about before.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.160
So like, there's like a retailer, like let's call it like if it's, yeah, again, like Nordstrom,

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.300
Boatlocker, one of these companies that's like a retail company.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.500
The cool thing about this is they have a very real product that they've been selling for

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.280
a long time and understand what they are doing.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.420
So like you add a lot of stability there.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.600
And by adding on data science, these companies are a lot like, okay, well, let's try and use

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:57.380
data to improve the product recommendations, improve the product, improve, improve our understanding

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.300
of things, you know, like use data to answer questions.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.600
So you get a lot of, there's a lot you got to do as a data scientist.

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:03.320
You have a lot of.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:03.480
Right.

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.420
They used to use intuition and now they're going to use data or something like that.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:06.580
Right.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:06.980
Yeah.

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.560
And so that's the upside.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.320
So downsides are you don't have as much money.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.440
Cause you're not like a rich tech company.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.940
Your tech isn't as good because you know, you just don't care as much about getting the

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:16.520
best of the best.

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.480
Like, you know, older tech is generally fine.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.920
And, you know, just as we were talking about, you generally have fewer people who can like

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.500
mentor you.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.580
Like there'll be someone there, but you know, there'll be people there generally, but it

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:30.240
might be that everyone know, everyone's using like a far outdated Python library because

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.680
no one knows about the new way and no one's reading up on it.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.440
So exactly.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.880
They're still on Python too.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.800
Something like that.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.120
Cool.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.700
And then early stage startup.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.700
What's the story for data scientists there?

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.080
Yeah.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.500
I could talk a little bit about this.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.940
So yeah, with data scientists, like you come in and you really get to shape everything.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.020
So like there's some negative parts.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.680
So even beyond the data science part, right?

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.420
Like you might show up at the startup and they're like, oh, we don't have your laptop yet.

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:58.240
So it's sort of a funny thing is like, there's, but there's also more freedom because they

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.640
might ask you like, Hey, what kind of laptop do you want?

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.860
Like if they're like a decently well-funded startup and you can be like, oh, I want this really

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:04.680
souped out laptop.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:09.360
You don't get that super slow clunky one with a huge company banner that takes five

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.080
minutes to start up.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.420
Yeah, exactly.

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:12.720
That's a mixed bag.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.160
But yeah, often you're like, it's talking about there's a lot of low hanging fruit.

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.660
You also have to wear, you may have to do some data engineering, right?

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:24.540
Like maybe there's not any data engineers and all of the databases are optimized to like,

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:25.840
you know, serve the website.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.480
And so it takes you five minutes.

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:32.220
So like get a count of a $800,000, $800,000, $800,000 row table.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:35.440
So yeah, so you have to wear a lot of different hats.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.220
You might be pulled in a bunch of different directions.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:41.740
So it's also really important to be able to prioritize, like to not just be like firefighting,

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:46.760
also take some time, like to, for example, build up some skills, like to build up your toolbox.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.880
So like, okay, maybe write a library for yourself of like, that's a wrapper around pulling

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.360
the data.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.680
So that becomes easier.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.920
That's a really important point, because I think a lot of these, I've worked in places

00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.680
like this, and it's nobody asks you to build a helper library for data access.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.160
They help you.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.300
They ask you, give me this answer or make this product or give me this thing.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.040
And you're like, yeah, but we really need this thing in place.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.060
And somebody's gonna have to build it.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.340
It's gonna be me or the other person I'm working with.

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:17.500
And you just kind of have to be willing to put in that infrastructure along the way, right?

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.580
Because you're going to appreciate it later, but there's no guidance for that.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:20.820
Right.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.400
And it's definitely not in place usually.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:22.720
Yeah.

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.740
And you have to like help teach people like how to ask questions, like what is possible,

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.900
like bring in best practices.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.500
So it's like I was saying earlier, I really would not most of the time recommend this for

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.780
someone's like first data science job to do this.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:39.740
But for an experienced data scientist, like I found some people who really, really love

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:43.200
doing this because they're like, oh, I don't have to deal with like, you know, the decisions

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.300
of past data scientists.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:48.420
I get to shape this in my vision and I get to use the most modern tools, for example.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:49.720
You want to use Python, you can.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.760
You want to use R, you can.

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.320
Like no one's going to, there's no one there.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.200
So you just, they just need answers.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:54.460
Yeah.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.980
You can use F sharp, right, Jacqueline?

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:56.540
Yeah.

00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:00.140
I get a lot of, a lot of people make fun of me because my favorite programming language,

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.140
no one else in the world uses.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.140
Well, I did see the Jupyter Notebooks now support F sharp.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.720
So that's, that's a vote.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.760
Be still in my heart.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.960
That's awesome.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.780
Yeah.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.260
But I mean, like early stage startups.

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:17.620
And I would say also handbag love companies a little bit as well because they may have some

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:19.180
tech stack, but it might be so outdated.

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.180
They're like, you're new.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:24.260
We want to like go in, we want a refreshing direction where you can go in this other way.

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.200
We're not going to make use this old thing.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.560
We're going to try to get, you know, get something new growing here.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.600
So you can go and have some flexibility as well, I think.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.400
Now, what about the videory, the later stage startup?

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:36.760
Yeah.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.880
For my preference, I think this is kind of a sweet spot because like you have like, you

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.700
know, it's sort of like in the, in the, in the middle of a lot of these things, right?

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.800
Like there's like some bureaucracy, but I kind of like bureaucracy sometimes.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.480
Like HR has their stuff figured out.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.320
Like that's nice.

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.560
It's like benefits and other things.

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.380
There actually is vacation.

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.340
Yeah, exactly.

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:58.340
You know, so there's usually like, there's a team of data scientists, but since it's, it's

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:02.520
still like a startup, you know, they weren't, you don't have like a, a, you know, 40 year

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.340
old tech stack, right?

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.740
Like most decisions were made made like five or 10 years ago.

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:06.640
If that.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.220
Yeah.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.120
So I think this can be a nice fit.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.360
Like you can still get, you know, you can still like know everyone on the data science

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:12.680
team.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:17.020
Like on like, if you're at like a massive tech company and have support, but also have some,

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:18.240
some structure in there as well.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.140
And there's probably like data engineers and other people to help out with like data science

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:23.040
adjacent problems.

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:23.280
Yeah.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.680
You're probably a little more locked into a tech stack.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.040
Yes, that is true.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:27.300
Yeah.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.640
I don't think you can really like do a tech stack from start.

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:34.600
And so you're locked into certain decisions, you know, and, and there may be sometimes you're

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.780
like, oh, I wish I have a time machine and like could go back and like fix this decision

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:38.720
they made a while ago.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:38.920
Right.

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.960
Like you're at an early stage startup.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.360
You can be like, all right, we're going to start like collecting data right away.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.900
You know, we're going to log everything.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:48.220
And then if you're at like a, you know, later stage company, they're like, oh, like, why don't

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.020
we like look at the state?

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:51.120
And you're like, oh, actually we weren't collecting that a year ago.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.040
And they're like, okay, but make a forecasting model anyway.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.500
And you're like, oh no, no, no, no.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:59.640
You don't understand how uncertain this answer is going to be.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.640
Yeah.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:05.920
And then I guess the last type of company archetype that you all covered was the government contractor,

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.660
the Lockheed Martins and the Hallibartons and so on.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:08.980
Yeah.

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:11.580
And I should also mention this includes the government itself, right?

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.900
Like if you work for the Department of Transportation or something like that, or just, you know, companies

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:18.920
where there is for legal reasons, there is just a lot of regulation, a lot of things

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.940
like, you know, keeping things moving a little slower.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.460
And so these kinds of jobs, they tend to, they have to tend to have lots of people who are

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:25.160
not data scientists.

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.440
And you tend to have the data scientists maybe embed in little groups of that.

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:32.980
So like in the missile department or whatever, or the, you know, truck department, I don't

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:33.100
know.

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:39.540
And so because of that, you generally, you don't have as much mentorship often, but you often

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.020
don't have as much people telling you, no, you can't do it that way.

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:42.540
You're wrong.

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:47.140
I mean, you may have it like, oh no, we don't support Python past 2.7 because our, you know,

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.300
our procurement department hasn't cleared it or whatever.

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:53.360
So maybe bureaucracy, but there isn't like, oh, you have to, you know, like there's, there's

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:57.240
just not as much of like a standardization around tech just because there's, you know, that's

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.300
not the focus of the company.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:01.660
And so these kinds of jobs, I'd say are really, they're really great.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:06.420
If you want a job where you go in each day, you work eight hours with a 45 minute lunch

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:10.320
in there, you get a little bit of stuff done, but you don't stress crazy about getting it

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.540
the most you possibly can done.

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.420
And no one's stressed about you getting exactly the most, right?

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.080
So there's not like, you know, if you're a job where you're like, I'm going to go in,

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.820
I'm going to be the 10X data scientist.

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:23.340
I'm going to rock, you know, my career is going to be a rocket ship up to the C-suite as fast

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:23.700
as I can.

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.240
Like, this is not the kind of company for you.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:29.400
It's the kind of company that's for more for people who are like, I just want to do a consistently

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.040
good job.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.780
Like then go home and take my paycheck and spend it on something I enjoy.

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:33.420
Yeah.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.640
And don't need a lot of perks.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.660
That's a good way to put it.

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.340
Yeah.

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:36.740
Yeah.

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:40.240
Because I've talked to people who are like, yeah, it's like, especially if you look at some of these

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.220
tech companies, right.

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:45.120
And like, I don't know, Airbnb and like Rose on tap or something like you, you're lucky if you get

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.760
coffee at some of the like government contractors.

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.660
Yeah.

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:49.680
That's for sure.

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:56.160
I think another thing that is interesting is so many of these types of companies are driven by like

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:59.820
government contracts or projects.

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:04.340
I'm thinking of like DARPA funding and like, here's a project that is guaranteed to run for

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:07.680
one year and then it may immediately get canceled no matter what.

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:08.200
Right.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:12.780
So you have like these sort of long time horizons of working on something, but there's, it could

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:17.840
become a totally different type of job because some other contract was won and this one was

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.080
expired, lost, whatever.

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:19.580
Yeah.

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:22.860
And I think there's kind of, I would say not just besides government contractors, you can

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.800
imagine there are some other fields that might kind of fall into this, like certain parts

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.040
of healthcare might kind of fall into this area.

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:28.920
Yeah, definitely.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:33.580
You imagine parts of finance, like some like, you know, rules around, you know, financial

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:37.780
risk regulations might kind of have some of these components too, but it's more the archetype

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:42.100
of the company that's got a lot of regulations or reasons why it has to move slowly and not

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:42.600
break things.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:42.840
Yeah.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:43.180
Yeah.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:43.600
Interesting.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:48.860
I think that's a really cool list you put together and I agree with a lot of your assessments

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:49.160
there.

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:49.980
So pretty neat.

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.640
Now we've been talking forever and we just barely touched on the stuff that you're covering.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.780
We could just talk for so long because this is such a great book and a great topic,

00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:01.640
but just for the sake of time, let's talk about one more topic and maybe blend this together.

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:06.740
So let's talk about getting the skills, becoming a data scientist from wherever you're starting.

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:10.480
And then also maybe just real quickly building a portfolio, because like I said at the beginning,

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:16.420
I do think having that first job is super important and getting that first job is strongly influenced

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.380
by just having something I can show.

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.760
You want me to do this?

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.720
I've already done it.

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:22.200
You don't have to verify if I can do it.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.140
I look, this is it.

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:23.760
Just look at it.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.220
You know, is it a personal fit or a salary fit?

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:27.880
Or whatever, right?

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.360
So let's start with getting the skills first.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:30.720
Okay.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.000
Yeah.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.780
Back when you were talking about a master's.

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:33.160
Yeah.

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.700
And Emily, you're talking about a bootcamp.

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.280
Those sound like two different paths to me.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.020
You didn't necessarily study programming, right?

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:41.540
You kind of went the math side, which actually I did as well.

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:42.020
Yeah.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:42.800
I can cover.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:43.600
Yeah.

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.140
Let me talk about all the different ways you can get skills.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.780
And then Emily can talk a little bit about the portfolio, because that may or may not

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.400
have aligned with the chapters before.

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.640
I mean, who's to say?

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.540
I would never reveal that.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:58.520
So we really, we think there's like four ways you can kind of get data science skills.

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:02.620
One is you can get a degree, which usually it's for people that go and get some sort of

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:06.840
master's degree, which is either like data science or maybe computer science or math, something

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.280
like that.

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:11.440
And the degree is great in that it, if you don't have that much of a background, you

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.460
will learn what you should, you will spend two years doing it.

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.680
So you should learn the basics of what you actually need, right?

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:20.340
The data science degree, you should learn the data science skills and you might do some projects

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:20.780
during it.

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.800
The downside is it takes two years and like 80 grand.

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.960
That's so much money.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:25.420
Yeah.

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:28.920
A bootcamp takes 12 weeks and like 15 grand.

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.660
So that's much faster, much cheaper.

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.400
And the whole point of a bootcamp is to get you what you need as quickly as possible.

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:38.500
And I feel to me like bootcamps almost do a better job of connecting you with a job afterwards

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.180
than like a master's program.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.240
Yeah, I think that's true.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.420
And I think generally I would recommend bootcamps more except for people.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.980
Bootcamps, you really need some sort of background already.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:51.680
Like you need to have some idea of programming or some knowledge of this kind of field already.

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.660
If you don't know anything about data science, that might be 15 grand.

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.180
Then you still are just kind of confused.

00:55:56.180 --> 00:56:00.260
You can, the third option is you could try and find data science work within your job.

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:03.260
If you're an analyst and you want to do more decision science, you can try and find

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.560
places where you can do decision science in your analyst job.

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.500
If you're a decision scientist and you want to do machine learning engineering, you can

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.980
try and find places where you can do some more engineering.

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:13.240
So you could kind of try and learn within whatever your job is.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:17.340
What if you're a scientist who kind of does a little computation and you kind of want to

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.200
drift towards the data science side?

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:19.540
Yeah.

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:23.500
So I actually know someone who is trying, you know, doing that very thing.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.020
She was, you know, she's a scientist.

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:29.740
She takes measurements and she's in her job has started to use R to actually make plots and

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.640
do the kind of investigatory stuff.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.920
And that's totally been working for her.

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:35.740
And then lastly, you can teach yourself, right?

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.760
There's all these courses online.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.340
You can work on your portfolio, which we'll get into.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.840
And teaching yourself is great because it's free.

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.660
You have to focus on the stuff you care about.

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:46.940
And yeah, you can really, if you can motivate yourself correctly, you can really like learn

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:47.520
a lot that way.

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.820
I've learned a lot this way.

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:53.100
The downside is, is that it requires an immense amount of discipline, right?

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.580
If you try and do everything learning online, you have to actually do those courses instead

00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:57.840
of playing Animal Crossing.

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.960
But yeah, not that I play Animal Crossing, but no, Jacqueline's just calling me out.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:08.340
And you know, you don't know if you're teaching yourself the important things or not.

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.440
At some level, you don't have a mentor when you're teaching yourself.

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.560
And that's a problem.

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:11.820
Yeah.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:16.040
It's also, I feel like sometimes when people are trying to teach themselves, they try to

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.380
boil the ocean, right?

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:17.580
Yeah.

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:17.940
Yes.

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.180
You know, like, well, I saw this and this and this.

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:21.140
So I got to know all those things.

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:21.640
Like, no, no, no.

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.380
You just vertical slices, not horizontal.

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:23.880
Yeah.

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:27.780
Like, figure out what you got to try to build something and learn what you need to

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:31.600
build that shallow or deep in these areas and then go from, like, iterate, right?

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:31.880
Yeah.

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.280
And I think a similar problem to that is when you're teaching yourself, there's not like

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.020
a natural stopping point.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:40.320
So like in a master's or a boot camp, like they end and then you're like, oh, I guess

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:44.060
it's like time for you to like find a data science job versus if you're teaching yourself,

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.160
it's so easy to be like, well, I can't apply to like a data scientist yet.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.000
I haven't learned like this thing or I haven't learned this thing.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.300
And you just make this endless list.

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:49.500
Yeah.

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:49.860
Right.

00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:50.220
Yeah.

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:54.380
Which I think is, is, you know, you're always data science is a, is a career where you're

00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:55.380
always going to be learning.

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:58.540
And so it's not like you, you, it won, like no one knows everything.

00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:02.940
So you don't have to feel like, okay, I must like master, you know, the whole world to

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:04.360
be able to get a data science job.

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:04.640
Yeah.

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.140
Yeah.

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:05.660
I hear you.

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.680
Let me put data science up a little bit on a pedestal here.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:12.860
Like, so I feel like as a developer, you can build web apps, work with databases, whatever,

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:16.440
like you can totally do a quick bootcamp.

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:19.460
You can take online courses, read books, teach yourself.

00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:22.700
I do feel like those are skills you can mostly get yourself.

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:25.740
They're like painful lessons you have to learn, but I'm not sure you'd learn those in school

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.100
anyway.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:33.460
But with data science, I feel like there is a level of statistics and like scientific understanding

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:36.580
and a little bit of math that I think is a little bit harder for people to just get on

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.060
their own.

00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:43.560
So having some formal training in the background seems more important for data science than pure

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.040
development.

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.960
I would guess I would broadly agree.

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.960
And not because the actual statistic and machine learning models you learn as a data scientist

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.800
are like somehow harder to learn than software engineering, but because the fields, those

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.220
fields are so confusing.

00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:02.100
And like in a layout, like statistics, like what is considered statistics versus machine learning

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:03.220
versus industrial engineering?

00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.280
Like these are all extremely poorly laid out.

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:09.580
The people in those fields make them as confusing as possible to make it seem like only they understand

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:09.860
it.

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:12.380
And there's not a really an easy pattern.

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:15.340
There's not really just like one book out there that's like, oh, this thing in statistics

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.060
is actually that thing in computer science.

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:17.740
And like, they're the same.

00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:20.720
And don't worry about that half of statistics doesn't super matter.

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.040
Like that's not easy information to find.

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:23.320
Yeah.

00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:23.920
Yeah.

00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.940
I do think though, it also depends on like what type of role you want.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:27.160
Right.

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.860
Like, so I think that's a little bit less important in analytics role, for example, to have like

00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:31.400
that background.

00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:35.700
And there is certainly like, you know, people do, you can still like learn some of this on

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:40.060
the job, you know, whether for like mentorship or like reading books or like other, other things.

00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:43.900
But I agree, like there is a bit of a danger because I feel like, especially with statistics,

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:49.440
it's like, if you run a statistical test, like it will generally spit out an answer, but it

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.720
may not be answering what you think versus right.

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:54.660
Like it's a little more obvious sometimes in development work, like, oh, the website didn't

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:54.900
load.

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.500
So I guess I have to like figure out what we're wrong.

00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.460
So there's a bit more of a danger there.

00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:58.620
Yeah.

00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.480
You're always going to get a number from that library, from those algorithms.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:01.780
Right.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.060
And you have to understand what it's doing.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.800
That's kind of what I was saying.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:09.360
Like, it's really clear if the website is letting the user log in or not.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:09.560
Yeah.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.560
There's not a huge debate.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.320
Maybe security is not quite right.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.580
There's details you got to get right.

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:16.620
But it's generally, it works or it doesn't.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:20.120
Just because I'm so upset about the point I made previously, because I think the point's

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.660
right, but I'm getting upset thinking about it.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:26.320
It's like, so like a linear regression or logistic regression has some built in assumptions.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.740
If you're in a CS department and you're like, I'm going to use a linear regression

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.760
to fit this as part of a neural network.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.980
People are like, fine.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:33.260
You did that in a stats department.

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.120
They're like, how dare you?

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.380
That's so incredibly wrong.

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:35.700
Right.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.860
You violated the assumptions.

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:40.760
And it's like, well, these are two trained academic professionals telling you two totally

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:41.360
different things.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.820
And I think that is something you get all the time in data science that you don't get as

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.260
often in software engineering.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:47.520
Yeah.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.500
It's exactly that kind of stuff I was thinking of.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:49.700
Yeah.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.700
Both the two things you both mentioned.

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:52.140
All right.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:57.220
Let's close out our conversation by talking about getting a portfolio, maybe mixing a little

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.080
possibly contributing to open source as we're at or something.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.240
Emily, do you want to give us the rundown on that?

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.040
Yeah, absolutely.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.900
So the idea behind a portfolio, and this is especially helpful for people who don't have

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:13.180
a formal education or haven't worked in very similar jobs or been able to learn on the job.

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:16.300
Because as you were talking about, this is a way they can show they can do the work, even

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.400
if they hadn't had an opportunity in school or at a company.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.160
Like a portfolio project.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.220
So we really recommend for it is doing something original that you care about.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.580
Because, you know, one thing people might default to is like, all right, I'm going to go look

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.120
on Kaggle.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.660
And I'm going to find like one of the data sets they have.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.340
And I'm going to like do this competition where they like give you a data set.

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.220
And they like, you know, tell you to predict this thing.

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:40.780
And the problem with that is like, one, it doesn't really show your personality.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.100
It skips over the steps that are really critical.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:48.500
And you'll need to do in like data science roles, which is like gathering the data, figuring

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.680
out what question to answer.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:54.080
And also, honestly, like if a company sees that in portfolio, you know, maybe they're worried

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.780
that like, oh, did they just copy someone else's code, right?

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.740
Like this is a problem a lot of people have worked on.

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:04.080
So we recommend, you know, kind of finding, figuring out a question you're interested in

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.020
answering, or finding a data set that's interesting to you and exploring it to like figure out

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.760
like, okay, what are some like interesting findings I can have from that?

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.000
And so putting that together and then sharing it on GitHub.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.660
So you have the code with the readme that describes it.

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:21.740
And then ideally also having a blog, because a blog is really great.

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:25.380
Someone may not look through, you know, like hundreds of lines of your code, but they might

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.380
be like, oh, yeah, let me read about like what they found.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:31.940
I'm like, look at some visualizations or read a tutorial that they wrote because they use

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.800
natural language processing for this project.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.220
Or even just look back two years and see they've been doing this for as long as they said

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.400
they have been or something like that.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.180
Yeah, exactly.

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:40.720
Exactly.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.940
And so Jacqueline shared the example project that she did, which is trading a network on

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:45.940
offensive license plate.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:49.300
So I do want to emphasize like it doesn't have to be, you know, something very serious.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.780
Or if you want to go into finance, it doesn't necessarily have to be like a finance project.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:57.140
Because, you know, if you're like, oh, I use like neural networks, or like one of the

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.340
projects I did was I built a dashboard.

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.680
And so that shows like I can build a dashboard from scratch.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.600
So I really think this can be like a great way to show off like some of your personalities,

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.060
your coding skills, your communication skills with the read me and the and the blog, and

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.380
maybe even demo in an interview.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:17.100
So when I was doing the job search after graduating from boot camp, I would show I bring my laptop

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:19.100
and sometimes I would show this dashboard that I had built.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.260
And I'd be like, look, and you could filter it and you can click around and it like you

01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:23.420
click this goes to a link.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:27.960
And I think that made it like much more, much more real to them than if I was just talking

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.320
about this theoretical project.

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:29.980
Absolutely.

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:30.660
That's awesome.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.540
That's really good advice.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:35.980
Another thing I think would be valuable is if people can in the right place, the right

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:40.340
background and whatnot is to maybe contribute to some project that's relevant in the data

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.020
science space.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:41.800
Right?

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.140
Like, if you have two people you're interviewing, and one's like, well, I'm pretty good at using

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:46.480
Jupyter.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:50.060
The other person's like, I had two PRs merged into Jupyter.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:54.080
And actually, you know, some of the people on the team, you know, a little bit who work

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.420
on like, okay, I know who I'm going to talk to a little bit more next about, you know,

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.520
it's a different level of credibility.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:03.700
Even if like what you did was there were no unit tests for this part of the library.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:07.380
So I wrote some unit tests, or I worked on the documentation, or I worked on a tutorial.

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.280
Like, it doesn't have to be I rewrote the main thing, right?

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.180
Yeah, absolutely.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:15.960
And we have like, I think it's 14 chapters on like joining the community.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.760
And that's one of the things we talk about is contributing to open source and exactly what

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:20.100
you said.

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:25.580
Like it can be, you know, writing new documentation, even fixing a typo, just these ways to get

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.060
involved.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:30.180
And, you know, I do want to emphasize that like, you know, this isn't something that is required

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.560
to get a data science job.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.420
Like I know a lot of data scientists who don't have like a GitHub with personal projects who

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.920
don't have a blog who don't contribute to open source.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.740
So they're still like excellent data scientists.

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.800
But it's just like, what are the ways that one, hopefully it's fun to hopefully you learn

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.480
something like that's the other big point of the portfolio project.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.180
It's a great way to direct your learning like you find out, oh, I need to like, you know,

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.120
figure out how to scrape this website, let me go like to gather the data.

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.300
So let me go learn web scraping.

01:04:55.300 --> 01:05:00.420
And three, like and to stand out in interviews, but it certainly, you know, shouldn't, I don't

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.820
think it should be like a requirement for any job, for example.

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:03.540
Yeah, right.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:04.160
I agree.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.040
And it probably a different company archetypes, they probably care or completely don't care

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:09.580
about this, right?

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:13.360
Like the big geospace, geo aerospace contracts, they're probably like, okay, great.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.240
We don't know that we trust you if you're writing code for just for open source.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.180
That might be weird, right?

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.520
Whereas like the startups are like, oh my gosh, that's so amazing.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.840
I can't believe, you know, or the big tech company.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.720
We're trying to move to open source.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.220
So that's great.

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.240
You can be one of our advocates.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:29.640
So yeah, I suppose that it probably varies a lot as well in there.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.060
All right.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:33.400
Well, I would love to talk more about this because there's a,

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:37.300
kind of cool ideas you two put in there, but I think we have to leave it at that.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.740
Let me ask you the two quick questions before I let you out here.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:45.440
If you're going to write some code, do some data, science data analysis, what editor do

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:45.960
you use these days?

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.820
I use RStudio, although what are my development goals?

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:52.380
I'm actually starting to use the Vim as the editor within it.

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.400
So I'm trying out that.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.080
But yeah, I've been, I've been using RStudio for, for years now.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.560
Although I also heard, what is it?

01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.440
Is it Visual Studio?

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.060
Like now SportsR and like one of my teammates was trying that out and really liked it.

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:03.180
Yeah.

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.140
Probably VS Code.

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:04.320
Yeah.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:04.700
That's awesome.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:05.120
VS Code.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:05.320
Yeah.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:05.820
And Jacqueline?

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:09.700
So I'm a 50, 50 split between RStudio and Visual Studio Code.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:14.760
So RStudio for anything R related, literally anything else, including like just notes to myself,

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:15.820
Visual Studio Code.

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.160
Yeah.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:16.580
Awesome.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:21.100
And then notable libraries out there for data scientists, not necessarily something super popular,

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.940
but you're like, oh, this package is really awesome.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:23.960
People should know about it.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.740
Do they have to be Python libraries?

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.340
No, they don't be Python.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:31.740
No, there's more of a data science topic.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.400
So it could be running across the board.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:38.840
Well, I will mention one of the libraries that I created when I was consulting for T-Mobile.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.180
It's called Load Test and it's for R.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:47.020
Me and the T-Mobile team made it and it's to help you if you're making an API in R using

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.500
the R library plumber, which is great.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:55.140
You can use the Load Test library to test it to make sure that your R model will be able

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:55.880
to handle the load.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:56.100
Okay.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:56.460
Awesome.

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:56.700
Yeah.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.340
Very cool.

01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:57.980
Emily?

01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.100
I have so many.

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.760
Now I'm wondering if I should, you know, say my own package as well.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.680
Do it.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.400
Stop from Boat.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.100
Stop from Boat.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.440
I'll briefly share.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:08.820
I use it less now, but I use it a lot at my last company, Funnel Join for like analyzing

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:09.980
sequences of events.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:11.700
You're like, all right, who like came to the website?

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:14.860
1% of people who visited the homepage then bought a subscription.

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.000
But what about if we want that within two days?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.020
So that's one.

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:21.960
But another package, R has so many packages that I like.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.820
So one thing that I'm very excited about, which is like sort of hot, it's been in development

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.220
for a while and in pieces, but is tidy models.

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:33.620
So we're rethinking of how to do modeling in R with a brand new website out now too.

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.420
So I think it's tidymodels.org.

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:36.780
So I'm excited about that.

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:42.960
And then finally, just when the janitor package is a fun one for if you do cleaning data, it

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.840
just has all these functions for like you import a data set and there are spaces in the names

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:52.060
and like weird capitalizations and like weird like characters that make it hard to work with.

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:55.020
It has a function like clean names and it will just fix all of those for you.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:55.680
Oh, that's cool.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.200
Yeah.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.740
And I think there's a PyGenitor as well.

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:02.200
I'm not sure if it's directly the same, but so people in Python, they do PyGenitor.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.320
You'll also go and throw one out there on the Python world for folks.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:09.500
There's this thing called MissingNo, MissingN-O.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.260
It's a visualizer for missing data.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:16.680
So you just have a Pandas data frame and you throw it at it and it'll draw you like a big

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:20.980
cool graph of visually where your data is filled in, where it's missing and all these sort

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:24.560
of like correlations of you're missing this data, you're probably also missing that data.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.280
It's super cool.

01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:25.500
Yeah.

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.860
There's actually an R1 for that, which is Manier.

01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:33.440
I never know how to pronounce that, but it's also for like missing, yeah, Manier for missing

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:33.740
data.

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:34.040
Awesome.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:34.320
Yeah.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:34.540
Yeah.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:35.460
That seems super valuable.

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.740
Just get a quick, like I've got all this data loaded up.

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.160
Let me just look at it.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:39.380
Yeah.

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:39.700
Visually.

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:40.360
Yeah.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:40.600
Cool.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.160
Yeah.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:41.480
Yeah.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.760
So tell us how people can get your book.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:43.560
Our book is online.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.420
You can buy from the Manning website, who's our publisher.

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.200
And we actually have two URLs because we had a disagreement about this.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.500
So we have the professional URL.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.140
Do you want the professional version of the book?

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:53.540
Yeah.

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:53.720
Yeah.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.080
DataSciCareer.com.

01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:02.220
And then we have the fun version of the book, which is at bestbook.cool.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:06.420
And now those will take you to the same webpage, but know if you click bestbook.cool, you're

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:07.820
getting the fun version of the website.

01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:08.140
Oh, yeah.

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:09.540
You're getting DataSciCareer.com.

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.420
It's the professional one.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:10.700
Yeah.

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:15.260
And maybe we should have people guess like which one of us, which one of us is the fun

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:16.700
one, which one is the four serious.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.200
Exactly.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.320
Put it in the show notes.

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:21.040
Put it in the comment section at the bottom of the show page.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.260
Awesome.

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:25.660
Well, Jacqueline, Emily, it was really great to have you on the show.

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:27.480
And I can certainly recommend your book.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.540
It's spot on.

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.320
It covers a bunch of great topics.

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:34.100
People ask me about careers all the time, and I always want to have good advice to give

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:34.280
them.

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.300
And so here's definitely something they should check out.

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.260
Thank you so much.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:38.040
Thank you so much.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:38.320
Yeah.

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.000
You bet.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:39.440
Yep.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:39.960
Bye.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:39.960
Bye.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:40.260
Bye.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:40.300
Bye.

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:43.820
This has been another episode of Talk Python To Me.

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:49.040
Our guests on this episode were Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolus, and it's been brought

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.580
