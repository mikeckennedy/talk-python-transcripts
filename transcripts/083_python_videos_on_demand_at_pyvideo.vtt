Have you ever searched for a Python educational video?

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.700
Maybe how to get started with Pyramid or running queries with SQLAlchemy's ORM layer?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.100
There's a good chance you've run across pyvideo.org.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.940

Browse by speaker, by topic, by event, and much more.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.700
This week, you'll meet Paul Logsdon, who's taken over the leadership of the project when

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.280
it was in danger of going dormant.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.180
This is Talk Python To Me, episode 83, recorded October 26, 2016.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.760
I have many interests.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.500
Sometimes you can play some of the things you've done.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.620
Welcome to Talk Python To Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.140
ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.260

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.060
Paul, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.300
Hey, how's it going?

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.060
It's going very, very well.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.080
Thanks for being on the show.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.080
I'm super excited to talk about what may be the largest collection of Python videos ever.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.220
And that PyVideo, this is going to be great.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.460
Yeah.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.840
I'm excited.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.840
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.060
Cool.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.120
So before we get to that, though, let's start at the beginning.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.780
What's your story?

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.080
How do you get into programming in Python?

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.840
Sure, sure.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.040
So I guess it all kind of starts way, way back when, you know, you first, like, get a computer.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.080
You know, your parents are like, oh, we should probably get the kid a computer so they'll be up on, like, the upcoming trends.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.160
Or maybe just the family needs a computer or there's a computer at high school.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.660
And that was what it was for me.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.740
I had a friend at high school that was into software stuff.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.080
And basically I just wanted to spend time with him.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.240
And he started to teach me HTML.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.400
And I ran with that for the rest of high school, building projects for teachers.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.860
Ended up in college, unsatisfied with the real static nature of HTML.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.980
So I started to learn PHP and was just like, oh, this is the best.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.860
I'm going to rule the world with PHP.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.980
You know, that's not that far off.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.600
I mean, Facebook.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.540
Absolutely.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.060
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.680
It was actually about the same time, too.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.460
Facebook and WordPress.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.280
Zach and Zuckerberg, yeah, we're running off.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.940
Of course, I didn't have those ideas of Facebook.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.200
I was more than just like, yeah, I think there'd be a better grading system that I could build.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.240
Yeah, let me go do that.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.340
Fair grading for everyone.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.760
Fair grading.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.020
And people can access their grades online.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.180
No, that's awesome.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.620
That's awesome.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.920
So did you build that?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.860
Something like this?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.280
No.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.600
I jumped through a few iterations of building my own homepage and building a link holder.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.660
So I used sites that I regularly visited for news or for school or for whatever, and I wanted those links readily available.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.380
And this was before browsers kind of had the notion of bookmarks, or at least I knew how to use bookmarks.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:40.180
So I was like, all right, we're going to build my own homepage that I know I can open up my browser to, and bam, I'll have my links.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.540
And I gave that to a few friends, and it was great.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.760
And then I had other things to do.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.620
It wasn't my major.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.060
It was just kind of something for fun.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.540
So life went the other way.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.920
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.500
Yeah.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.980
Things were different back then.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.560
I mean, we take so much for granted on the web and things, you know, like Google, for example.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.780
The ability to just go and type and search for a thing, that didn't really exist in some of the time frames you're talking about.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.540
But, like, Yahoo was really there to, like, actually manually collect the links and stuff like that, right?

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.380
It was a different world.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.140
Yeah.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.340
No, it was, I remember Dogpile and maybe it was AltaVista as, like, search engines.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:29.200
And really these were, like, you'd ask for something, and it would go off, and you might get back what you're looking for,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.020
or you might get back just an endless array of just garbage pages.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.500
I really like pages that people had left behind must have been months to years ago.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.020
How many GeoCities do you think?

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.000
Oh, oh, my goodness.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.900
All GeoCities.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.240
99% were GeoCities.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:55.700
And a good 30% of them were, like, mine that I, like, tried to create and was just like, no, got to start a new GeoCities or Tripod page.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.700
This isn't working out.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.460
All right.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.420
So how did you go from PHP to Python?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.120
Yeah.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:09.780
After I, you know, got through college, had PHP fairly well under my belt, I was like, but I really want to know how to create GUI apps.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.860
I want to be able to create something that people can, you know, start up as a regular application like Word.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:25.360
But I really didn't like the idea of investing myself into a language that boxed me into either GUI or web development.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.220
Because, you know, I already knew PHP for web development.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.620
I wanted something that kind of did both.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.920
And so I knew Python was object-oriented.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.120
And in my newbie mind, I was like, object-oriented?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.700
Well, GUIs are objects.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.280
So, you know, not really understanding at all what an object meant.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.720
I just knew it's like, I don't know.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.820
It's like, yeah, cars are objects.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.880
GUIs are object-oriented.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.180
Object-oriented programming.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.820
That must be what controls Word.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.660
So I jumped into Python.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.400
And it was great.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.960
I think what really attracted me was the tutorials that were available at the time.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.520
I remember going through, like, Google's Python class, which was, like, only, like, eight exercises.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.820
But it allowed you to do really, like, powerful stuff in a very short amount of time.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.340
And it was like, oh, okay.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.180
Now, you know, I'm getting better at this fast.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.520
This is fun.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.400
So I kept on going.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.040
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.480
Excellent.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.640
And, yeah, and you've been doing a lot of Python since, huh?

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.920
So what do you do day-to-day?

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.660
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.500
What do you do day-to-day?

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.960
Like, what's your programming job?

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.780
Yeah, so I work at a company called 15.5.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.260
We are, like, a tool for employees and managers to stay in sync.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.180
So, like, you check in weekly on 15.5, answer some questions about, you know, how you're feeling and where you're stuck.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.960
And then that will hopefully allow managers to do a better job of supporting you.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.960
And so I write back.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.680
Yeah, that's one of the challenges that you can have at any time of your work, especially if you're remote.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.700
It's just, like, even, you know, knowing, like, who's not really happy, who's excited, like, that kind of stuff, right?

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.720
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.020
Okay.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.500
And ultimately, I'm, yeah, I think you hit it on the head.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:20.360
I think maybe a little bit more of what drives me for it is sometimes there's just not a place where you feel comfortable to say what you want to say.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.520
And unfortunately, that's the case in too many places in the work environment.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.840
I myself have been in that situation.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.360
And this allows you to kind of be by yourself.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.320
You know how there's a disconnect when you're on the web?

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.720
You're not in front of the person you're talking to.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.360
And some people run with that and are called trolls, right?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.320
And they just abuse their ability to be disconnected from the person they're talking to.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:56.120
But also, that space can give you almost freedom to really think about what you want to say and collectively build what you want to say.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:02.360
Not collectively, but individually build the collections of things that you want to say and be more truthful to yourself.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.780
And so I think that's another big thing that it provides.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.100
Yeah, I agree.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.140
You know, obviously, in that environment, trolls can be a problem.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:21.640
But I think much more often, it reduces the barriers and the anxiety and the confrontation avoidance and all that kind of stuff that you would get in the way of just having a straightforward conversation, right?

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.760
Right, exactly.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.060
Yeah.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.060
But I also have kind of hesitation on that.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.500
I'm like, well, maybe are we just giving Tylenol to a problem?

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.380
Maybe we should be focusing on this issue in a different way.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.260
Should we be allowed?

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:45.140
Should we be putting more education and research into why aren't people feeling uncomfortable to talk to people when they're right in front of them?

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.420
You know, why can't we have these more intimate one-on-one conversations in person?

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.640
And so I definitely could see it being a Band-Aid rather than a cure.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:04.880
But maybe, again, I don't have the answer, but maybe by Band-Aiding it for a bit, we can heal enough to figure out the cure.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.820
I'm not quite sure.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.480
Yeah, sure.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.280
I don't know either.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:16.300
And I'm not sure if the environment that we're creating with all the devices and asynchronous communication are making it worse or better.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.200
I don't know.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.120
But a Band-Aid is better than nothing, I would say for sure.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.380
That's cool.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.140
Yeah.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:28.120
One of the things that you're really passionate about is education and providing education to everyone, right?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.720
Yeah.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.740
Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:37.260
So I don't know if you watch the Netflix and you watch the media.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:46.400
Personally, I don't really watch the news too much, but I watch a fair amount of documentaries, and I talk with friends who are also pretty socially conscious-minded.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.320
I'd like to think they are.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:56.040
Maybe I'm just in a bubble of people that are not really worried about the real-world things.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:07.220
But I've had several relationships with teachers, and they're just – so, yeah, there's tons of just junk going on in the world, and I really don't know how to fix.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.700
I don't know how to fix any of it at all.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:15.600
But I do know what's helped me be a better person, and that's been education.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:22.340
And I don't really feel prepared to educate in the things that I don't know myself.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:33.880
So I'd like to be able to educate on how to be like a better social worker or be a better English teacher or, you know, know more about mental health.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.540
I just don't know those things.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.440
I do know how to program.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:50.300
And also, along with knowing what I can teach to a certain degree, I also feel like just education in general, along with specific skill sets, has made me a better person.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.020
And especially handing off those skill sets has made me a better person.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:04.800
Being able to communicate to teach someone, it takes a certain amount of skill in teaching, and that's a skill that is really about listening to your fellow human being.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:14.640
I think being a good teacher is probably more listening and understanding the question that the student has rather than throwing out the information that you have.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.000
Sure.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:30.140
And when you're teaching anything, understanding where that person is, where their mindset is, where they're trying to go, like that is super important into actually getting what you're trying to teach to say, whether that's trying to teach how to access the database or something else, right?

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:30.800
Exactly.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:30.840
Exactly.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.200
Yeah.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.280
Yeah.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:39.800
So, like, knowing, you know, whenever you're solving a problem, like high school chemistry teacher said, whenever you're solving a problem, it's where are you at and where do you want to be?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.620
And then figuring out the in-between.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:47.720
And so that's the same thing you're doing for a student is you're figuring out where they're at, you know, sort of where they need to be.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.020
Your job is to kind of create that bridge.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:59.980
You said something like kind of like to the effect of, well, I'm just a developer, but I think developers have a certain superpower in today's society, right?

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.300
We're kind of like the magicians.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:01.940
Sure.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.420
Absolutely.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:14.380
We don't always know what to do with our magic, but we can, like, wave our hands for a little bit and out pops a thing that can have a huge impact on the world in all sorts of ways, Uber or Pi Video or YouTube or whatever.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.880
Well, you really elevated Pi Video there.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.200
Yeah, among the likes of YouTube and Uber.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.820
If only we had that kind of cash flow, the things we could do.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.880
It was more of a good for the world rather than a financial.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.500
Sure, sure.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:30.720
Yeah.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.220
But I would love to see that.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.980
I absolutely agree.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:47.640
So maybe I, a little being a developer, a little too much, but it was more just to say, like, this is the subsection of knowledge that, you know, I know that this is my domain knowledge and this is what I can confidently give out.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:54.580
And even when I say confidently, it's more just kind of like a little less scaredly than giving other bits of knowledge, right?

00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:00.920
Because even developing for I don't know how many years now, I'm still like, did I say that right?

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.680
Maybe I did.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:01.700
Maybe I did.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.220
I don't know.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.120
They'll figure it out.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.100
If I said it wrong, eventually somebody will correct them and really correcting me down the line.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.400
At least I hope.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:20.480
So not only do developers have like an extreme magician capability, but right now that extreme magician capability, like magicians are in demand.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:33.040
And so that's the other thing that you can do for somebody and is give them a skill set that will could potentially totally transform their livelihood.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.280
I say this out of my own experience.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.280
I got a degree, but I really didn't have, I didn't have a good job.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.160
I didn't necessarily come from a super well-off family.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.480
And this is not to be like a boo-hoo story.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.480
It's just like being a programmer totally transformed my opportunities in life.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:59.000
And being able to give that out is, I mean, that's the best thing you could do with this knowledge right now is give this out.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.420
Yeah.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.400
It's super rewarding.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:09.280
Like I'm thrilled to be able to do this podcast because I hear, you know, weekly from people like how it's made a real difference in their life.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.800
You know, I've got a new job.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.760
I've got a new career.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.660
Thank you so much.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.400
Like, wow.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.820
You know, it's, I'm just sitting here chatting with people and it makes a difference.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.500
I mean, it's, it's amazing to be able to share this kind of knowledge.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.440
It really can make a difference.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:20.980
Yeah.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.040
That's the thing.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:22.320
Yeah.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.100
All right.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.220
So let's talk about PyVideo.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.760
Why don't you tell everybody what PyVideo is and sort of give them a background.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:35.980
I'm sure if you've done a search on Google for some kind of teach me this video Python, you'll find PyVideo.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:43.260
I did a quick test a minute ago and I pulled up an incognito window and I type P-Y-V into Google.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.720
And it suggested PyVideo as like the second thing.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.820
So it's definitely, yeah, it's definitely out there and well known.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.860
So tell us what it is.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.040
Right.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.320
It's just an index of Python videos.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.560
So maybe I'll take out the just.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.660
It's an index of Python videos.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:05.660
Its goal is to make finding Python video content easier.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.080
Where quickly you can get to the video that you want.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:17.640
So if it's all just thrown up on YouTube or if, say, an event where there's Python videos captured doesn't really have a space to live and people don't want to put it on YouTube.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.260
Well, maybe they can send us those videos.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:26.380
We'll put it on archive.org and then post links to that in Python or PyVideo.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:31.960
The goal is simply to make finding Python content easier.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.940
It's like a really centralized catalog of Python presentations.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:38.540
Exactly.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.940
And with lots of ways to explore that data.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.560
Exactly.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:41.860
Yeah.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.820
So, yeah, maybe.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.340
Yeah.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.500
There's definitely a better way I could have explained that.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.340
So here's what else.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.120
No, no, it's all right.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.480
Yeah.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.260
It's, like I said, an index of a collection of Python videos.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.140
But it's not just the web page that you see.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:00.360
The bigger project that's going on is the data collection.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.980
We got done with a lot of help from a lot of volunteers at the PyCon sprints, PyCon 2016 sprints.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:12.140
We got pretty much a fully functional index site built, right?

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.900
It's a statically generated website.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:24.080
Every time somebody pulls new content into the PyVideo repo, it's automatically redeployed with all the latest content.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.580
So it's super easy to manage and just real simple front end to the data.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.640
But the data is the real, the holy grail of this or the real content.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.540
And that data is constantly being built out.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.340
And what is the data?

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:46.400
It's just a bunch of JSON files with JSON blobs that contain, you know, the title, the description that you see, and links to the videos.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.260
And anybody can add to this content.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.060
Anybody can.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.640
It's as simple as creating a PR from you fork the repo.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.680
You create a PR.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.740
And with your event's content.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:05.760
And so long as you follow the pretty detailed guidelines for how to contribute, you're almost guaranteed to get that pull request in.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.500
Yeah, that's great.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.580
So first of all, how many videos do you have currently indexed?

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.700
5,481.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.420
Wow.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.460
That is a serious amount.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:15.960
Yeah.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.960
Half of them are just me waving and saying, Python, Python, Python.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.820
Yeah, they're all great.

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:26.440
That's almost, a lot of these are conference presentations and stuff.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.860
Maybe an hour, half an hour maybe.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.840
That is a serious bunch of stuff to go learn.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:45.040
I think one of the really interesting things, one of the good things, a well-done thing of the Python community is about publicizing and sharing all the conferences.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.680
And there seems to be a really solid, concerted effort to record and share what is done.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:18:03.340
Like, I was really impressed at PyCon US this year that basically the same day, maybe the next day, the videos from the conference were going up on YouTube.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.820
You can go to youtube.com slash PyCon 2016 and pull those up, right?

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:15.560
But there's many, many events that go on around the whole world, and we can't go to all of them.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:15.960
Exactly.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.320
Right.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.180
I saw some really great ones from KiwiPyCon.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.140
I'm sure I'm messing up the name a little bit, but the New Zealand one.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.880
There's no way I could go to New Zealand for a Python conference.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.800
Well, maybe someday if I'm lucky, but I can watch it, right?

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.800
And I can enjoy it.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.720
And I think that's really great.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:39.380
And so your project, now that you're maintaining it, I'll call it yours.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.000
I know it didn't start with you.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.080
We'll talk about that, the world.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.720
But this project, let's say, does a real good job of bringing those together.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.840
Because I can't, like, cruise YouTube and go, well, is there a PyCon AU 2016?

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.200
Right.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.620
I don't know, maybe.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.420
Right?

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.440
So having this all brought together is super valuable.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.500
Yeah, exactly.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:05.340
And I think you hit on a really great point is that you wanted to see what the rest of the world has to offer.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:11.200
The rest of, at least New Zealand has to offer for Python videos, Python education.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.960
And you could go do that quickly.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.400
Maybe New Zealand's okay.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.740
But say in other parts of the world, say Africa.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.080
I know my brother is in Cameroon right now.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.540
And if he tries to go to YouTube to search up a video, it's going to take him a long time.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.280
But we're not even talking about downloading the video to watch or buffering the video to watch.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.560
We're talking about just getting to the content that he wants.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.040
It can take quite a long time.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.780
And that's even with, you know, Google aiding his search.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:45.240
So if he wanted to get to a particular Python video, this site helps him get there faster.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:52.840
It's less hops to the end goal that he wants to get a real long or a real complete list of what's available.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:20:02.140
And that means that people who are searching for educational content can get to what they need faster and don't need to waste time when they could be learning.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.540
Right.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.280
Yeah.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.760
And you, so all the data is stored in a Git repo, right, on GitHub.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.140
Yeah.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.340
And you can just clone that.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.220
And like you said, if you want to contribute to it, you just fork the repo, make some changes.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:22.280
Basically, you create like a JSON document in the right place, in the right format, you'll pull request, and back it goes.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:29.740
So one thing I wanted to ask you about is what type of videos are you looking for in PyVideo?

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:37.840
So when I look at PyVideo, I look through it, and I see that there are a bunch of conference presentations, like I kind of hinted at there.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.180
And that's awesome.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.160
They should be there.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.380
But are there possibilities to put other ones?

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.540
Like if I did just like a random tutorial and I put it up on YouTube, could I link that in there, or would that be inappropriate?

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.380
No, that'd be totally.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.240
Are you looking for just conference presentations?

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.220
No, absolutely not.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:21:00.480
I mean, as long as it's not like a video on snakes, just the actual Python, I think you're in the right category to create a PR.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:12.640
I think when it comes to teaching, which is one of the major goals of this project, at least for me, I know other parts of the PyVideo team, they might have different motivations, and I think that's great.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.780
But for me, a lot of it's the education focus and getting the word out there.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:22.220
Having several different teachers tell you the same thing is quite powerful.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.360
It can shed light on how different people interpret different problems.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:36.900
And so if you have a tutorial that goes over the exact same thing as another tutorial and it goes over the same thing as a talk that was given at a conference, absolutely it's still welcome.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:43.300
If it is a tutorial, if you're thinking like, I created this in my basement, does it belong on PyVideo?

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.060
Ask yourself, is it about Python?

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.780
Is it trying to teach people Python stuff?

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:48.980
Yeah.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:55.800
Yeah, so people, I think there's probably a room for people out there to add a bunch of stuff.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:03.800
Like Kevin over at Data School is doing like a Python tutorial a week sort of thing, but none of those are in there, right?

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.140
Like it would be cool if he put his in there and I have a number I could put in there.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.020
And, you know, there's a bunch of people out there that I think are not necessarily contributing.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.780
So maybe this could be a little bit of a nudge.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.440
Right, right.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.880
That'd be great if they contributed or they created a PR.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.680
I think all requirements that we have is keep it open, keep it simple, and keep it free.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.480
And that's really our building philosophy.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.620
So not even our, you know, not like a restriction.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:35.320
Like if it's a complex video, don't withhold it from PyVideo just because our motto is keeping it simple, right?

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.520
But as long as it's free, like you can't link to something that's going to happen.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:38.820
Yeah.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.300
If it's something that is more or less self-contained and it's like a lesson on Python.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:43.700
Yeah.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.240
Okay.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.940
I think I understand what kind of videos you're looking for.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:23:05.960

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.960
Check them out.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.980
It helps support the show.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:24:02.660
Tell us the story.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.000
This was started, when was it started?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.520
It was started by Will and Sheila, but I don't know when.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.740
Why don't you tell us the history real quick, as much as you know it.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.800
I wish I could tell you in greater detail.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.600
I don't have it off the top of my head, all the bits and pieces.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:25.920
But I think there was something of a collection of videos prior to Will getting started on it in 2012 or 2011.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.700
And I think he wanted to create a web front for it.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.780
And he had an idea and decided to build it out in Django.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:41.140
I think Sheila joined him shortly thereafter, helping him build that out and bring in videos.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:49.300
And they were just going at it, building out this site for, I guess, four years, five years.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.260
By the time they decided they wanted to do other things.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.960
And they did an amazing job.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:01.640
We had, probably, when we got started, 3,000-some videos, maybe more.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.280
Forgive me if it's more, and I'm incorrectly quoting Will and Sheila.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:10.400
But they did the bulk of this data collection and categorization.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:23.420
And when early 2016 rolled around, I think it was January, I woke up one morning and pulled up by video.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.400
I watched by video while I do other things.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.300
And I saw the banner up at the top, and I said, oh, crap.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.940
This is going down.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.400
We need to do something about this.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.400
And I read Will's blog.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:43.960
I really, I just didn't want to not have this tool there for me to watch videos while I did other things.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.500
Right?

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.520
You're taking away part of my entertainment.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.080
This is my routine you're talking about tinkering with.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.400
Yeah, you're getting so much out of it.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.980
You're like, well, I can't let this happen.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.040
Maybe I have to, maybe you have to solve the problem.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:54.440
Yeah, exactly.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:54.800
Yeah.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.500
And so I sent out a few emails.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.740
Didn't hear anything back.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:05.580
I just assumed it was like, all right, yeah, they're probably getting pummeled by other people doing this.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.360
Trying to help them out with this.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:19.080
So, you know, I won't think into it too much and just let me start building out a small thing just in case that it's not nobody else is doing anything.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:23.960
And sent a link to Will and Sheila saying, hey, this is what I got so far.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.600
Got some words back from Will and Sheila.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.280
And I forget exactly what the conclusion there was.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.660
But I think it was like, well, we're still working on figuring out, you know, what the long-term solution for this is.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.420
And then came May.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.300
So PyCon 2016.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.860
It was basically we, I think somebody else went up to do a lightning talk.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.320
Yeah, it was definitely, his name's Cameron.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.100
But I'm trying to think of his Twitter handle.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:56.160
And so he got up and gave a lightning talk about, hey, we need to do something about this.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.100
And I was like, oh, great, awesome.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.680
He's also in the same boat.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.600
And that must mean that somebody, maybe I can help with them.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.260
You know, somebody else has got something going.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:10.760
And I showed Cameron the site that I had built out, which was a statically generated site.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:16.580
And basically the website went that way because it was already pretty much built.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.980
The skeleton was.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.540
And all that really needed to be done was styling.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.360
And when I say all that needs to be done, a lot of styling needed to happen.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:34.400
It looks totally different than what it did when I was building it, thanks to, like, the big team of people that were helping out at the PyCon sprints.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.020
Sounds cool.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.220
Yeah, it looks nice these days.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:36.400
Yeah.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.140
Oh, my goodness.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.740
I wish I could say that was because of me.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.620
No, this is because of a large team of people.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:52.880
And not only did we have this web team that was working on, you know, making my site more user-friendly and more viable, more robust and prettier.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:28:04.020
But we also had another two sections that were working on, like, archiving the data in a better way and also refiguring out how we're going to hold on to data over the long term.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:14.760
And I think once Will and Sheila saw that it had a good foothold and a new pathway, they were happy to let it go that way.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.220
I think they wanted, you know, they spent a lot of time.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.580
They spent four years working on this project.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.020
You know, they want to make sure it's in good hands.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:28.300
And I was flattered to hear that they were okay with it going into our team's hands.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:33.480
Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention on how to contribute and how the flow went before.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.800
So maybe I just don't know.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:44.420
But it feels like the way you guys have it set up now is it's very open and it's very much a community project, like contributing data all through pull requests.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.600
And there's a bunch of people that work that aren't in the sprints.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.080
And it feels like it's sort of spread out to be maintained by more people.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:51.620
Is that true?

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:52.700
That's absolutely right.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:52.940
Yeah.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.400
I'm certainly not the most active maintainer right now.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:06.020
Like I think maybe in the first couple of weeks after PyCon 2016, I was doing a lot of work.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.740
I definitely don't even think then it was necessarily that I was doing the most work.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:16.880
It since has become that my job is to help introduce other people into how to help with the project.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:27.540
And then they tend to jump on and, you know, just blow me out of the water in terms of, you know, making pull requests, making sure things are clean and making sure that the site keeps keeps growing.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:27.840
Yeah.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:33.520
So you're kind of like the catalyst or the initial moving force or whatever to get it revived.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.900
I feel almost that that's too much to say.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.260
I am simply I'm a good sign.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.640
Like, you know, when you're driving down a dirt road and then there's, you know, two paths.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:49.520
I'm a really good sign at the fork in the road saying, all right, well, you just go that way.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.720
And you'll eventually get to three miles down the road that way.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.200
Yeah, exactly.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:54.520
Yeah.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.080
42 pull requests and three contributors and then we'll be there.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:58.540
Exactly.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.640
Pretty much.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.700
Nice.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.040
Okay.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.860
So what do you guys need from the community to like take this to the next level or at least keep it thriving?

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.580
Great question.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:11.340
We need more contributions from conference organizers.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:17.760
So usually who has the money to pay for video cameras to record talks and stuff like that is conferences.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:25.080
A lot of meetups that are happening around the world don't have AV equipment to capture this stuff.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:30.580
So even those individuals that do, we're asking them to create these PRs.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.840
That's probably the biggest thing.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:45.260
So we can go out and scrape, but that's never going to be, it's going to be very hard to get us to the quality that could be achieved by just getting that data directly from a conference organizer.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:53.660
So when a conference organizer puts on a conference, we're looking for them to serialize that data into a JSON form.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.440
The specs are very, I think, very clear.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.920
But, you know, of course, if you have improvements on that, let me know and we'll make it clearer.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.800
But pretty clear specs on how the JSON blob should look.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.940
And all it is just, you know, post the PR.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:20.900
If that's difficult to do or, you know, just too time consuming, because I totally understand that I've run a few conferences with a team of people here in New York.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.800
And they are, your time's gone for basically the three months before a conference, right?

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:36.740
So if that's not a possibility, then maybe just a CSV file and send it to us via a GitHub issue, and we can work it from there.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:50.540
At the very least, try and create YouTube videos that are titled and have descriptions that conform to a certain specification that allow us to scrape the information a little bit easier.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.100
Those are the few areas where conference organizers could really help us out.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:32:10.020
If you're not a conference organizer, or you are, or it doesn't matter who you are, but you want to help out, we're always looking for people to help us scrape the web for these videos, whether they're on YouTube or Vimeo, and clean up the data to get it in a ready state to be part of the collection.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.240
Oh, yeah, that sounds great.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:21.840
So one thought that came to mind, you know, to sort of build on all what you just said was there are many, many, many meetups going on all the time, right?

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.000
There's one going on in Portland tomorrow, and I'm hoping I can make it.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:32.620
There's probably some really cool presentation going on at all these that for every conference, there's 30 meetups, right?

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:44.780
What about some sort of call to action to, if you're going to go to a meetup, and you have solid HD camera and like a lapel mic or something like that, like offer to like do a recording of it.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:52.000
If the speaker is up for it, and the leader of the meetup is up for it, that seems like that would generate a lot of new content as well.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.300
Absolutely, yeah.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.840
If you, yeah, so I will use your words verbatim.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:12.580
If you have solid AV equipment, you know, and you have the time, you have the resources to hand back to the community in that way, that's a huge way that you could help out the PyVideo effort, the education effort around Python.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.620
We would greatly appreciate it.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:15.000
Okay.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.940
Yeah, yeah, that would be awesome, right?

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:21.620
There's got to be a lot of people with like a 4K camera and a tripod and a microphone, right?

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:21.900
Yeah.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.020
That can't be that rare.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:27.620
All my friends have, yeah, like 4K, you know, MacBook Pros.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.180
No, I don't know.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:35.980
So you don't necessarily, I don't know if that was a lead into explaining the quality requirements.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:41.900
There's not really a whole lot of quality requirements when it comes to the videos that can be posted.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:53.300
So long as you have something that can record in a way that you can watch it and understand clearly what the video is trying to be said or trying to be said in the video, you're set.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.380
That's all you need.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.280
You don't need the fancy dancy-ness or that to record.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:58.760
Yeah.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.480
Okay.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.680
Is there like, when I'm looking at the site, there's a couple of interesting things about the site.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.180
I want to talk about the technology.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.800
But you can go there and just sort of like when you show up at PyVideo.org, you get just the latest talks.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.240
Right now I see some from PyBrazil.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.640
And you can sort by events.

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:20.300
You can say, I would like to see all the presentations from DjangoCon 2014.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:28.020
You can also go by Tags and say, like, I want to see all the stuff that has to do with like ARGPARs.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.260
Right.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.640
And there's like two videos on your site about ARGPARs, for example.

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:31.320
Right.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.200
And you can see by speakers.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:37.560
Is there a way to say, like, show me the really popular or highly rated ones?

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.520
No.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:43.760
Is there like some sort of this is what the community has really liked feeling?

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.620
No.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.580
That is in the site?

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.320
No, there's not.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:51.320
And I understand, like, the luster around that idea.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.780
I myself have kind of, like, tinkered with the idea.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.380
But I don't know that that's necessarily needed.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.260
One.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:04.720
So and our kind of one of our parts of our motto is let's keep it simple.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:10.900
So if it's not really needed to help people find what they're looking for, we're not going to really include it.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:15.260
And sure, there might be people that are looking for, like, what's the most popular video.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:21.020
But I don't I haven't heard a whole lot of requests for that, I guess, is what I'm saying.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:21.560
Yeah.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:30.120
And if I flip through if I flip through the tags, I find that, like, for the most part, for the most part, there's not a tremendous number.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.000
Right.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.440
Like for any particular thing.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.800
So if I look at just flipping through on suds, there's one talk.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.520
So it doesn't matter how highly or lowly rated that is.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.500
There's one, you know.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:40.920
Right.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.020
And, you know, like setup.py, there's three whole talks.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:48.060
Like you could probably just watch those if you're trying to learn about setup.py.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:48.800
Right.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.240
There's some like SQLAlchemy has a number of them and things like that.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.400
But the web has like 90, 89.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.020
Okay.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:56.280
Yeah.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:56.560
Yeah.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.100
Very interesting.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:57.700
Yeah.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.100
And also, I didn't want to.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:10.440
I think I vetoed that idea also because I didn't want to kind of direct people in their search for whatever knowledge that they were searching for.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:17.040
It was I didn't want to become like a popularity kind of a contest.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:17.680
Sure.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.660
So that was maybe another motivation.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.000
Yeah.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.040
And I would certainly never want to see like a downvote.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.760
Exactly.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.920
You know, like certainly not a downvote, but maybe an upvote someday.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:36.620
If there's 100,000 and you're really trying to find of all the thousand things on, you know, the pyramid web framework, maybe someday you guys could revisit that.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.780
But I don't I guess it's not really needed yet.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.440
That's cool.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:45.540
So if somebody wants to like work on the project, become a core contributor, how do they go about that?

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.680
What's your philosophy for making someone a core contributor?

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.420
I'm pretty loose, I think, compared to other projects.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:58.380
I like to plug by video as an easy way to get in your like open source credits or open source experience.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:02.100
I'm very readily try and merge things in.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.620
If you've if you've got a PR, it's got to meet, you know, the certain minimum requirements.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.980
But other than that, try to merge stuff in ASAP.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:13.840
One, because, you know, that's content that other people are waiting for.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:22.000
I know I've sat waiting for like stuff to be updated on Pi Video for conferences that have happened like a month ago or something like that.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.140
And that's not any statement on Will and Sheila.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:28.460
That was while I was running the site and I just didn't have time to get around.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:41.100
But the idea, I think, the philosophy for me is this site doesn't have to just be a learning experience for those who view, but a learning experience for those who contribute.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:49.180
So if you haven't given back to any open source project before, I think this one's a super easy one to get started with.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:56.880
And I want you to make a stab at it and work you into the fold quicker so that you can gain these skills.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:03.760
This is an opportunity for people to try out their open source contribution skills.

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:04.300
Yeah.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.920
And it really is pretty easy.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:11.720
You know, like I said, you put together some data, title, video, tags, things like that.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.360
You work on this JSON document.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.380
You do a pull request.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:27.760
It's not like you're looking at like a tight loop in the CPython runtime or interpreter and going, you know, I need to understand the performance tradeoffs and implications of writing this slightly differently.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.920
It's not anything like that.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.360
It's like, hey, I'm going to sort of add to the data catalog.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.360
The other half, though, is the website.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.600
And the website is really interesting.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.580
Like you said, it's statically generated.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:44.340
And one thing I found interesting is I turned on the dev tools while I was cruising around it in the browser.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:53.320
And after the first request to a page, the site renders like 100% from cache, local cache, which is a pretty cool effect.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:53.800
Yeah.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.620
So what's behind the site?

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.180
How does that work?

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.900
GitHub actually does that beautiful work for us.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:06.020
Again, to keep it simple, the idea is that we run on minimal infrastructure.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:11.300
So when somebody creates a new PR to the data repo, we'll merge that in.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.240
And then the data repo is updated.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:18.900
From there, maybe a few PRs will get merged in to the data repo.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:27.900
And then from there, we will create a new PR in the PyVideo repo, which is the repo that contains all the static site logic.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:32.500
It's built on Pelican, which is a static site generator built in Python.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:38.700
And we update simply the SHA of the submodule for the data repo.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.800
So the data repo is a submodule of the PyVideo repo.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.800
And all that's in the PR is just that SHA changing.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.120
We merge that in.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.300
And Travis CI handles the deployment.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.940
Everything is automatic.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:51.420
Everything is automatic.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.420
You just sit back and wait for three minutes and it's done.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.480
And that was done for a few reasons.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.260
One, it's very easy to maintain.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.820
There's no servers I need to worry about.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.460
There's no keys I need to hand out, anything like that.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.920
It's simply just Travis CI handling everything in the background.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.100
And then it's fast.

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.320
That's the other reason.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:21.480
It's when you're trying to download something from somewhere else on the planet, I don't want you to be slowed down because all of our servers are here in northern Virginia.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:26.300
GitHub does the job of spreading the site around the world.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.560
And hopefully, I haven't traveled.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.560
I actually will be traveling to India in the later part of December.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.780
And I'll be making sure we're fast down there.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.020
Nice.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.760
Yeah, test it on your phone or something.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.040
Exactly.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:40.360
Yeah.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.900
That would be cool.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.760
It's super zippy.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:48.480
It probably does make a few things like, for example, my voting idea.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.280
It's much harder with a purely static site.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.760
It would add more complications, certainly, than it's worth, I would think.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.700
But it's a really impressive way to do it.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.520
Is that GitHub Pages, basically, with a custom domain map to it?

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.500
Yes, exactly.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.540
And that's another thing.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.020
Yeah, it would make it more complicated.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:15.340
And that's another reason we go with or I'm pushing for us to stay with something this simple is eventually people want to move on from our project.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.240
This is actually another point I wanted to make about contributors.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.200
This should not consume anybody's life.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.480
We should be able to give back to the community, but do so with an extra hour that we have a month.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.360
This shouldn't be taking 15 hours of extra time a week.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:45.180
So keeping it simple and keeping it to a point where people can come in and out easily will hopefully lessen the stress burden that comes along with becoming part of an open source project and ultimately allow it to live on longer.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.180
I think that's a really interesting point.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:57.880
You know, you could have thought of like, well, we're going to have like the Python's universe of like YouTube with like fancy uploading tools and voting and all the various things.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.080
Right.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:03.820
And that maybe that thing never gets built or if it gets built, like it consumes too much of your time and you've got to drop it.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:12.620
I think there's a really cool lesson from saying you've put together something that is good and good enough, but so crazy simple.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:17.580
Like anybody can review a pull request and hit merge and then wait a few moments.

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:23.040
You know, like the other thing that's cool about that, I think is it's instant.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.740
Well, it's three minutes, but it's a relatively instant, right?

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:31.880
It's not like somebody submits something to you, some data, they email you like a CSV and then you've got to enter it to a backend.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:37.240
And like eventually you'll get around, like you said, you're waiting for a month to get some of the data in, right?

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:47.320
If people can just enter that as a JSON document and do a pull request, like it's, there's almost no effort on your part other than to like see that it's not bad data to put that in the system.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:47.800
Exactly.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.640
Exactly.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:57.920
And that means more time for other open source projects, more time for my family and friends, more time for just enjoying what's on PyVideo, right?

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:58.260
Right.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.040
Well, and more sustainability for PyVideo.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:00.760
Exactly.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.120
Yeah.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:01.460
Yeah.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:09.180
I think, I guess I'm viewing it from like the sustainability is how much life can I live beyond PyVideo?

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:16.040
And, but when I say how much can I really mean like all of the maintainers, how much life can we live beyond PyVideo?

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:21.000
And with PyVideo, the more it is, the more maintainable I think it is.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:21.940
Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:22.700
Yeah.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.620
As well as how much, how easy it is to bring someone onto the project.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:37.580
I think that way, like if somebody steps down, some new person can step in and it's not like, well, there's actually, you know, an interesting problem going on with PyPI right now.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:37.760
Right, yeah.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.540
And I'm going to do a whole episode on it.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:49.480
But the old PyPI, the reason that Donald's stuff was basically the only guy maintaining it was it was such a rat's nest to understand.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:44:00.740
I think it, like the entire, like what's running PyPI now, not the new PyPI.io version, but the older one, the primary one, was like two files.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.920
And they were like, two Python files are like 20,000 lines long or something insane like this.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.620
Right.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:10.000
You know, and he's, Donald said people would come and look at it.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.760
They all want to contribute and make PyPI better.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.680
And they would come and look and go, yeah, but no, not actually this.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.200
I'm sorry.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:23.080
So they rewrote it in Pyramid and Bootstrap and it's on a good, it's on a better path.

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:23.780
Yeah, I'm excited.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:31.440
But I think that's a lesson for open source, right, is like if it's such a mess to contribute and it's so hard to get started, like people won't do it.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:31.820
Yeah.

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:35.440
So you have like the anti-PyPI problem here, which is great.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:40.600
Yeah, I hope it's, well, yeah, we'll leave it there.

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:52.200
I mean, PyPI is solving a different kind of problem, right, but still it's like it's an open source project that's crazy easy to get started in instead of something that's like really, really hard to do your first steps.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:52.520
Right.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:52.920
Yeah.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.940
That's the goal.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:45:08.400
This portion of Talk Python is brought to you by Hired.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.420
Hired is the platform for top Python developer jobs.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:16.220
Create your profile and instantly get access to 3,500 companies who will work to compete with you.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.100
Take it from one of Hired's users who recently got a job and said,

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:24.380
I had my first offer on Thursday after going live on Monday and I ended up getting eight offers in total.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.840
I've worked with recruiters in the past, but they've always been pretty hit and miss.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.680
I tried LinkedIn, but I found Hired to be the best.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.780
I really like knowing the salary up front.

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.140
Privacy was also a huge seller for me.

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.820
Sounds awesome, doesn't it?

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.860
Well, wait until you hear about the signing bonus.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.260
Everyone who accepts a job from Hired gets $1,000 signing bonus.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.920
And as Talk Python listeners, it gets way sweeter.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:50.160
Use the link Hired.com slash Talk Python To Me and Hired will double the signing bonus to $2,000.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.940
Opportunity's knocking.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.720
Visit Hired.com slash Talk Python To Me and answer the door.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.900
So you talked a little bit at the beginning about what you're doing with your job, but what other projects are you working on?

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:07.900
What else you got going on?

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.160
I got pretty excited about this one.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.100
I wanted to know more about the CPython internals.

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:21.640
And so I set out to create a comparator operator, which would compare two objects, kind of like the greater than or less than symbols.

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.860
But I wanted mine to be two carat symbols.

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.940
So on my keyboard, shift 6, right?

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.540
Shift 6 will give you that little carat.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.540
If you put two of them together, it kind of looks like cat ears.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:42.360
So I wanted to make a cat comparator that you could override with the dunder cat thing, just like you can do with, you know, the matmul operator, which is the yak symbol.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.960
And I figured it out.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:48.740
It took me probably a month worth of extra time on the side getting around to it.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:58.220
And I'm not super proficient at sea, but I got it, and it prints meow, or it can print whatever you want it to print.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.680
So I'm pretty excited about that.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:10.100
I'm confident now that I can go into something a little bit more adventurous and maybe actually make a PR against the CPython core.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:14.580
That's a bucket list thing to do is contribute back to the CPython in some way.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.100
Yeah, that's a great bucket list.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:16.400
Yeah.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.680
Okay, cool.

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.900
Thanks for the validation on that.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:32.360
I was explaining my cat operator to – so I work in a collective workspace, and one of the people in the collective workspace, you know, is this multimillionaire dollar CEO type of guy.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.960
And I was there late Saturday night.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.660
He was there late Saturday night.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.020
It was just the two of us in the office.

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.700
I get done with my cat comparator operator.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.600
He gets done with I don't know what.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.220
We're both going down on the elevator.

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.180
And, yeah, I'm explaining my cat operator to him.

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.180
And he's like, oh, cool, cool, yeah, uh-huh.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.620
And then I'm like, yeah, so what did you do?

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.780
And he's like, oh, yeah, I opened up a new hotel.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.500
And I'm like, oh, wow.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.520
So I guess, yeah, we both have accomplishments.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.600
That's fantastic.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.780
Yeah, no kidding.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:14.140
And then he went home to his wife and said, you know, I met this guy in the elevator, and he's trying to teach computers about cat ears.

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.340
I don't really understand.

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.100
It's a weird place.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.200
I met this really creepy guy in the elevator talking about cats.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.980
So glad to be home.

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.280
No, I think that's great.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:29.000
You know, in episode 22, I did a whole show with Philip Glau about the CPython internals.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.600
He did a really cool thing, and I don't know if it's on PyVideo.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.460
If it's not, it should be, called the CPython Walk.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:41.800
And it's 10 sets of one-hour videos of his graduate course studying the CPython internals.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:47.260
If people want to check that out, that's definitely, if you're looking to dig in, that's really cool.

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:47.520
Yeah.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:54.820
All right, so I think we're getting close to the end of the show, so let me put the two questions I always ask my guests at the end.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:49:00.640
First of all, over 90,000 PyPI packages these days, speaking of PyPI.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.080
And, Shirley, you've come across some cool ones.

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:07.260
Which one would you like to recommend to people that maybe they don't know about?

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:11.480
This was really hard for me because I use so many different ones for different things.

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:20.340
You know, a project is usually not super cool to me just because there's one thing that I use from the open source community,

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:23.980
but because of a bunch of things that I can pull together from the open source community.

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:30.260
So, but I think I'll probably do Unicode or Unidecode, I'm sorry.

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:39.640
It has a special place in my heart because it was the first kind of attempt I made to port it to CPython or a C module in Python.

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:44.740
So I took Unidecode and tried to make just a C version of it to see if it would go any faster.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.060
But it's pretty cool.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:55.120
It takes Unicode characters and decodes them into, at this point, I'm not really even sure what exact encoding it decodes them into,

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.660
but it tries to come up with some ASCII version of it.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:02.120
So it basically is somewhat offensive in a way.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:10.660
It tries to take all the languages that are and symbols around the world and compress them down into ASCII text or American.

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.780
Yeah, the ASCII text.

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:11.960
Yeah.

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:15.860
It says you shouldn't be whatever native language you are.

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.720
Compress it down into America.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.800
And so, yeah, unfortunately, we have to deal with that.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.260
Yeah, but there are systems that only display ASCII.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:29.960
And so either you get boxes or you get something that actually could be useful.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:35.540
So it's, while offensive on an answer, it's also, it can be powerful in others, right?

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.980
Powerful and somewhat necessary sometimes, yeah.

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:38.680
Yes, exactly.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:39.340
Cool.

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:39.780
All right.

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.100
And so when you write some Python code, what editor do you use?

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:42.900
50-50.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.500
50% of the time, it's in Vim.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.120
50% of the time, it's in PyCharm.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:46.760
Okay.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.860
A perfect split.

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:48.720
Cool.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.380
All right.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.680
So, Paul, it's been great to talk to you.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.160
You got any final call to actions for people?

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.460
What do people need to do to make PyVideo better?

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:58.220
Go out, learn, and share.

00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.060
That's all.

00:50:59.060 --> 00:50:59.600
Awesome.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.160
Okay.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.320
That's a great call to action.

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.780
Well, thanks for sharing the story of PyVideo.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.600
And thank you for working on this project.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:10.120
It's been very helpful to me, and I'm sure it's been helpful to many, many people.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.460
So thanks for that.

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:11.960
Yeah.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:12.460
Thank you.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.600
Very flattered to be here.
