00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.040
Have you been learning Django and now you want to get your site online?

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.240
You're not sure about the best way to host it or the trade-offs between the various options?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.900
Maybe you want to make sure your Django site is secure.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.380
On this episode, I'm joined by two Django experts, Will Vincent and Carlton Gibson.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.080
Talk about deploying and running Django in production,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.660
along with recent updates in Django 3.2 and beyond.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.180
This is Talk by Thunder Me, episode 301, recorded January 19th, 2021.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:43.700
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.500
the language, the libraries, the ecosystem, and the personalities.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.300
This is your host, Michael Kennedy.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.500

It really helps support the show.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.680
Before we get to our discussion, just one quick announcement.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.380
We started live streaming the recordings of Talk Python to Me episodes on YouTube.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.120
If you're part of the live stream, you'll have a chance to ask questions,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.140
and your comments might get featured on the air.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.720

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.860
and see upcoming and past live streams.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.940
Now, on to the show.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.000
So, Carlton, Will, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.540
Again, welcome back, guys.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.360
Yeah, thank you.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.280
You came on our show, and I was on your show three years ago.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.800
So, Carlton's first time on your show.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.920
Talk Python newbie.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.580
It was great to have you on the show before, Will.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.860
And we talked about Django then,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.860
and I suspect it won't surprise people with you and Carlton here

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.200
that we may touch on Django.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.180
I think we've got to talk about Django a little bit.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.980
A little bit.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.340
Carlton, tell people who you are.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.140
I'm a Django fellow, so what that means is I help to maintain the framework.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.820
A framework the size of, oh, you've got me on Twitter there.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.420
Oh, yeah.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.320
Carlton Gibson on Twitter and on GitHub, numerous other places probably.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.200
But a framework the size of Django's, it just simply doesn't get maintained

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080
on purely volunteer effort.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.620
So, there's a body called the Django Software Foundation,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.860
which Will's on the board for.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.460
He can tell you a bit about that in a second.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.840
But they are a charitable foundation, which, well,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.180
they collect money from donations from GitHub sponsors,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.460
and you can donate on DjangoProject.com.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.460
And then the main thing they do is they contract the fellows,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.960
which is myself and Maris Feliciak, who's my colleague now.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.960
And we do that.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.720
I don't know.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.120
What do we do?

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.080
We triage the tickets.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.360
We do pull request review.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.320
We do handle security issues.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.580
We handle the releases, not least the alpha releases today.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.260
So, today, literally today, we released Django 3.2 Alpha 1.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.820
Fantastic.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.720
Is that the very first 3.2 release?

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.680
That's the first one.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.280
So, that's like if you've got a Django project and you've got CI,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.480
you download it now and you run it on your CI

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.060
and you tell us all the things we broke.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.960
Better before we release the final.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.740
You know, it's much better during the alpha pre-release period

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.560
than, you know, just after 3.2 final, you go,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.680
hey, everything's broken.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.060
Yeah, you really need people to test it now

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.220
before it's too late, right?

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.280
Yeah, but yes, it's quite exciting

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.840
because the last couple of weeks have been building

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840
towards the feature-free.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.420
So, the alpha marks the feature-free.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.560
So, over the pre-release period now,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.160
we'll merge bug fixes in the new features.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.020
So, anything that people find and report will fix

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.700
and get out before the final.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.220
But there's no new features going into 3.2.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.840
So, on Thursday, just gone, I branched the stable branch

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.640
for 3.2, which will be, that's Django 3.2.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.560
And it will be that for the next three years

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.320
because the long-term release gets quite,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.740
the long-term support release, which 3.2 is,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.500
gets three years of support.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.120
That's really great.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.840
All right, we're going to definitely have to come back to that,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.800
but also, welcome, Will.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.460
Tell everyone about yourself.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.140
Real briefly, you know, you were on the show a while ago

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.980
and we talked, I believe it was learning Django

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:44.980
we spoke about, right?

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.380
I've been involved in Django, it's the time.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.080
So, I'd written, I think, a couple books.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.220
So, I have three books,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.800
Django for Professionals and APIs.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.840
And the last two years, I've been a member of the Django Software Foundation board.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.320
About two people who were voted in,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.020
who play a prominent role in the community one way or another.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.360
And then the board is seven people annually voted on

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.980
who managed Django itself, which is a non-profit.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.860
About that later.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.100
So, yeah.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.820
And I have now a website, learndjango.com,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.960
which is an online version of additional content.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.200
But in addition to having a podcast with Carlton, Django Chat,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.260
since he's a fellow, which is contracted by the board,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.760
we have another touchpoint, as if we didn't need more.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.560
Exactly, yeah.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.740
So, I was on your show a while ago and that was super fun.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.980
I really enjoyed our conversation there.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.040
And, you know, maybe just tell people quickly about your podcast.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.660
What kind of stuff do you cover there?

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.960
Obviously Django, but, you know, where do they find it?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.520
What do they cover?

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.640
Okay, so we get people on from the community.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.440
It's kind of an interview type basis.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.220
We get someone on.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.780
It's fortnightly now.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.620
We were doing it every week, but, you know,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.200
not like you, Michael, we can't keep it up forever.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.280
So, we've gone fortnightly,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.160
which has taken a bit of pressure off with COVID

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.320
and, you know, the kids off school and all of that.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.160
But we get, you know, people who've contributed to Django

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.640
or people who are using Django in their business and talk about it.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.840
So, it's Django Chat.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.100
It's chatting about Django.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.980
It's chatting about Django, yeah.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.180
It's chatjango.com.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.480
I think recreating a little bit of what you would have at a Django

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.360
event.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.580
So, these are annual events.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.020
So, we started after I went to my first DjangoCon and met Carlton

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.160
and was like, why can't I talk to people about Django more often?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.740
And at the time, there wasn't a Django podcast.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.580
So, yeah, we've gotten to interview really my dream list of guests.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.820
I mean, we had...

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.020
Actually, I was just talking to someone else who works at Stripe,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.280
which is still running on Sinatra, which is a Ruby thing.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.160
And I was like, yeah, yeah.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.100
I've talked to DHH because he's came on our shows.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.420
We talked about Rails versus Django.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.140
We had Carl Meyer on, who's at Instagram, was formerly DjangoCore.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.060
All the...

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.620
Basically, everyone...

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.200
Almost everyone we'd want to talk to who's involved in Django is willing to come on and

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.940
share their story.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.200
So, I think it's a really nice connector and educational for us, too.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.840
I do as well.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.920
And you're just sort of a sidebar for our show here.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.160
Being all of us fellow podcasters, I think it's really interesting the role that podcasts

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.320
play in keeping connections to the broader tech community when we can't go anywhere.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.240
I mean, even if you weren't typically going to conferences or meetups, you could still go

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.760
to work and see other people, right?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.220
It's just first when COVID hit, I was like, I'm just...

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.140
I'm not traveling anywhere.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.300
I'm not taking my kid to school or anything like that.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.660
So, there's no natural place.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.300
Here, I'm stuck for 45 minutes.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.240
I'm going to just listen.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.800
But as it's drawn on, I've started to listen to shows, especially with multiple people trying

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.200
to bring sort of a normalcy.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.720
And I get to kind of hang out with these people, even though they don't respond to me.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.640
I still get to hang out with them.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.540
And I think that's a really interesting societal thing that's happening right now.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.860
Yeah.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.680
I think it's beneficial across the board.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.640
I mean, probably like you all, I listen to podcasts outside of tech as well.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.300
And it's sort of like people I'd want to sit in on their conversations anyways.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.700
So, for me, it's probably my primary media consumption aside from books.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.040
Yeah.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.960
But I mean, I'm not reading ancient Greek like Carlton.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.560
Carlton has a PhD and all that.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.120
We're going to talk about specifically deployments on Django.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.340
I mean, we can go on and on about obviously all the intricacies of Django.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.080
But I think suffice to say, I'm an educator and on the board and Carlton's a fellow.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.640
So, he makes the releases happen, including 3.2 Alpha, which just dropped today.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.580
And I guess you mentioned LTS.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.520
So, that's confusing to non-Django people.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.920
So, since having fellows like Carlton, Django has a pretty rapid release cycle where it's

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.160
every nine months or so.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.380
So, there was 3.0, 3.1, 3.2.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.940
This December, I think Carlton is 4.0.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.060
One of those is a long-term service release.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.180
So, that'll last two and a half years.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.160
So, if that is a three years.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.480
Yeah, it's on.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.400
There's a link on the Django project site.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.500
So, that's a way that.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.380
So, Django doesn't really have.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.300
It's rare to have breaking changes these days.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.180
But the LTS is designed to help people who can't keep up with that cycle stay up to date.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.880
Though we have a lot of podcasts and opinions about why you should always stay up to date.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.540
And it's worth it.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.740
Yeah.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.420
Because that's one of the most rare things you can do.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.080
Because as Carlton mentioned, there's bug fixes constantly.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.400
So, there's 3.1.1, 3.1.2.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.940
There'll be 3.2.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.040
Then there'll be 3.2.1 a month later or so.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.180
I'm a big advocate of, you know, if you possibly can get on the latest major release.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.120
So, hanging out historically, the long-term release was really important.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.600
The LTS release was really important.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.180
Because there were breaking changes, right?

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.840
In each major version of Django, there were new things.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.800
And it was difficult to keep.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.120
But that's not the case anymore.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.960
It's really easy to update.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.340
So, I'm a big advocate of that.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.740
Now, and then when I, you know, I talk to fellow people in the Django community,

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.780
they're like, well, you know, I work in the real world.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.740
And you can't always keep up on the latest major version.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.640
So, for those folks, then, you know, the LTS is a really good option.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.000
Because it's once every three years.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.780
You know it's coming.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.240
Yeah.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.800
You get a six-month window of overlap of support.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.920
So, the old LTS gets six months of security release after the release of the new LTS.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.560
And that's your window to update.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.460
Well, I think that running and maintaining software built upon frameworks like Django,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.340
it falls into two categories for me.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:53.840
It falls into, here's something that we have a team or at least somebody dedicated to owning

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.380
this project.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.560
And we care about its ongoing life.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.060
And then we have the ones that are the, oh, please don't touch it.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.640
And the, oh, please don't touch it is we've long since stopped developing that.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.680
Maybe the person who developed it left.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.140
But it's still important.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.960
And we don't want to break it.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.140
It's working right now.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.620
But if you touch it and you break it, you've now adopted it.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.540
You know what I mean?

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.120
Like, it's that thing that just, it runs.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.320
It's like if you break the build.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.340
Yes, but, but worse because it's legacy build.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:26.400
So, to me, I feel like that please don't touch it side, the LTS make perfect sense for them.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.640
Yeah, entirely, entirely.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.520
The way I like to think of it is, is this a thing that you're feasibly going to add new

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.160
features to?

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.700
And if you're feasibly going to add new features to, then you should be on the latest major

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.120
version.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.200
And because it's only, it's once every eight months, you need to allocate a day or two to

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.920
keep up, to, you know, fix up, download the new version, run the test suite, see the

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.240
deprecation warnings, fix the deprecation warnings.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.140
You know, maybe you have to wait a couple of weeks for a dependency to update and, and

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.120
then you can push forward.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.240
And that's once every eight months, that process.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.240
And if you're adding new features, if it's a live project, ideally you'd be there.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.820
There's something which you just need to keep running for the long run.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.620
You know, you could do that much less frequently.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:04.920
Right.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.680
But it allows people who have that, please don't touch it.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.000
But, oh, there's a security problem.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.920
If there's no LTS and there's a security problem, then not only do they have to figure out how to

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.780
redeploy the fix, they've got to say, well, we didn't touch it for three years and it doesn't

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.680
quite work the same.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.360
So then you get into the discussion of, well, what's the risk?

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.780
Will they really, it's just Java swing.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.180
I mean, come on, what's the problem, right?

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:32.200
How bad could that go with, you know, like the entire world's credit report speed?

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.780
Now that we're in Python 3 world, Django was part of that.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.600
It's really beyond the security thing.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.580
It's also all the ecosystem around Django, the third party packages.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:45.620
Like a lot of times, if you look at their project that says, I can't update, why can't you update?

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.540
They did two things.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:51.520
They're using a third package, which falls into that, you know, touch it, you broke it situation.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.520
Or they did something custom at one point.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.080
They went off the guardrails and the bill comes due.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.160
I mean, it's so tempting.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.040
Actually, I want to, speaking of going off the guardrails, quick note that Django just passed

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.560
Flask to have stars, which is a really poor metric of popularity, but nonetheless, we'll take it.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.500
Yeah, congratulations.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.100
That's awesome.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:16.080
It's very easy to, you know, spin up a couple API endpoints and boom, you're using Flask.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.160
That's a very different thing.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.700
That's like, as DHH would say, that's a Lego versus the Lego truck that is a framework like Django.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:31.200
And anecdotally, a lot of places use Flask, but in terms of a big site that's all Flask, that's much less common than all Django.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.600
Yeah.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.800
Well, I was thinking about this morning and it, you know, the Flask and Django are pretty neck and neck in terms of popularity.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.360
They're not on GitHub.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:40.860
Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.140
There's these metrics and popularity.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.640
They, there's like all over the map.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.540
So one of the thoughts I had though, is the people that use Flask, this is not a knock against Flask.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.060
I like it.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:57.880
But one of the, my sort of impressions is if I just need to, like you said, just create a couple APIs and just, we're just going to get something going real small and simple.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.640
And it's just roll.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:06.380
Like those people are not as invested in the ecosystem and the framework as I feel like the Django folks are.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.500
I feel like the Django folks, it's a more encompassing part of their development.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:17.540
Like Django feels more part of the project when people adopt it and love it.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.040
I don't know.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.860
What do you guys think about that?

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.200
You need a dozen apps to use Flask.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.720
And I hope that we get David Lord on to talk about Flask because he's at Django Cons.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.920
I mean, it's not a competition.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.640
I don't mean to say there's a competition between the two, but there are different purposes, I would say, Carlton, right?

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.060
Yeah.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.140
The different styles as well.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.140
Like, you know, if you want to put together something, why not Flask?

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:48.180
But I mean, I've been using Django for so long now that even if I just need to spin up two endpoints, it's much quicker for me to do that in Django than it is to go and get a supposedly micro framework and work out how am I supposed to use this?

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.780
We can put the link in the notes.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.900
I made up a repo with the code because you didn't provide code.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:13:04.040
You can have a single file Django project the same way you can for Flask because a lot of times that whole little world comparison will lead people to assume that Flask is much less complicated than Django.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.200
And it's a little bit less.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.080
It's more around to how it's structured, which is the point of Carlton's talk.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.840
Yeah. So the talk was called How to Use Django as a Micro Framework or something like that.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.860
And it was about the base HTTP handlers, the kind of that real core of the framework.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:26.900
And I put up a few examples from different frameworks, like Flask and an old example and Starlet, the async micro framework from Tom Christie.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.060
And then I showed how you might put that together in Django.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.380
Yeah. For people who don't necessarily live and breathe the web stuff like the three of us do.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:34.700
Yeah.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.220
Give them a quick definition of micro framework before you go on.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.160
Well, in the talk, I was like, you know, what is a micro framework?

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.640
Yeah. I'm asking you because I don't want to put my foot out there.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.640
The answer I came up with was it's got a great hello world, right?

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.520
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.680
I think the idea is that it's easier to contrast it with like Rails or Django.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.800
Rails and Django, they come with the batteries included with everything you need.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.600
You know, you've got your ORM or active record.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.820
You've got an ORM, you've got database, you've got migrations, all that stuff.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.000
Yeah. You've got all those stuff.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.680
Whereas your micro framework, you perhaps get the core HTTP handling and that's about it.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.480
And then you have to go and find a forms library.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.840
Okay. I found a forms library.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.420
And then you have to pull in an ORM or a database of that.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.520
Okay. I'll use that.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.180
And, you know, so there are Node full batteries included frameworks.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.560
Like Happy is very good.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.620
It's got everything you need.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:29.420
But like the classic Node example is, oh, you know, I get Express and I pull in this thing for passing URLs and that thing.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.360
You know, so there's a continuum.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.840
But micro frameworks fit more towards that.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.600
You know, you put the pieces together yourself.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.740
Whereas a batteries included framework like Django, you get not everything but a lot in the box.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.200
Right.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:47.900
Right. But your experience is more Django pieces, Django building blocks than a little flask, a little SQLAlchemy, a little this, a little that.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.180
Definitely. And I've been doing it so long now that I'd struggle to break out of that.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.920
I just, you know, I throw in a bit of Starlette or a bit of FastAPI, see what's going on with the new frameworks.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.880
Every new framework that comes out, I'll always give it a run.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.380
And then my question is, okay, well, what can we learn from that?

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:07.100
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Square.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:11.060
Do you run or want to build a web application that sells products or services?

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.940
Building a successful online business is the stuff that dreams are made of.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:20.540
But accepting payments and handling credit cards with all the various regulations is a common stumbling block.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.760
But not with Square's payment API.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.780
With Square, your Python web app can easily take payments.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.980
You'll seamlessly be able to accept debit and credit cards as well as Square gift cards.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.580
Let your users pay with their digital wallets.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.380
Square works with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and MasterPass all in one go.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:42.260
Your API includes PCI compliance, end-to-end encryption, dispute management, and fraud detection.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.500
Build your online payment form in three steps with Square payment SDKs.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.140
Step one, create a new Square API application.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.140
Step two, add Square's payment form to your checkout flow.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.020
Step three, use Square's API to charge the card.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.500
So get started building your business on Square.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.380
Just visit talkpython.fm/square or click the link in your podcast player's show notes.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.020
That's talkpython.fm/square.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.040
A really large site.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.760
If you ask them what language and framework do you use, it's like everything.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.220
Just because of the needs of a massive site, it ends up being...

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.760
It's hard to say that it's truly one thing.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.560
I mean, Instagram still has pieces of Django in it.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.580
But at that scale, it's its own thing.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.140
And I think the micro frameworks are really good for doing that.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:38.300
This might be a pessimistic take, but I've heard people make that a micro framework allows you to switch the complexity from individual developers who may be sharing you just as much up to your upper level because they only can touch a tiny part of the monolith.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.240
So they can, in a way, do less damage.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:46.720
That's actually an organizational argument for micro frameworks is that only the software architects or the senior people fit it all together.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.460
They weave the pieces or they build the puzzle or whatever.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.780
That, I guess, especially if you're testing suite isn't as good as it could be.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.120
Yeah.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.820
I don't know.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.660
I think there's an interesting conversation about like monolith type software styles versus not.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.620
I'm actually a big fan of the monolith style.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:11.400
All my attempts to break it into little pieces, at least in the microservices, which is not the same as micro framework, but I always feel like I've quadrupled my deployment complexity to half my software complexity.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:16.380
And I'd rather manage half as much software complexity as twice as much deployment complexity.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:23.840
Like if you were part of a five person team in a large organization assigned to fix something and you're just like, there's no way we can get done within this monolith.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.100
But like, oh, we could spin something up and solve the problem and move on.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.220
I play that by a lot.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:38.140
I think, you know, or an individual project, you get fancy and you customize Django or you use a third party package that is out of date or maybe you shouldn't use any of the same issue.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:38.860
Yeah, I don't know.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:44.520
Like, OK, we're segwaying slightly back into the deployment topic, which ostensibly we came to talk about.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.360
But I think the thing with microservices, right?

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.660
So if you've got a massive corporation, you can't have all the things going on in one team.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.240
So you need to segment it somehow.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.360
And then you can define service boundaries and it starts to make sense.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.660
Then all the tech blogs become about microservices and how this is the way.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.280
And then learners come along and they're like, well, I've got to build my thing using microservices.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.300
It's like, no, that's really not a good move.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.560
But where are the blog posts?

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.640
Not for, you know, and now the pendulum swings back.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:20.480
And, you know, there are lots of posts now about how monoliths are making return and how they're the way to go.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.960
And so hopefully the beginners come and see those posts.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.340
But when you're learning and everyone's saying, oh, you must use a microservice architecture.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.200
It's like, hang on.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.800
Yeah, because the people who are knowledgeable are writing about their day job.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.380
They're not writing about spinning up a Django app on a weekend, which is possible.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.280
And you can deploy it, too, which we could.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.540
Should we get into that deployment?

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.040
I do want to just point out, I think this might be the article that I read before.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.540
Like the, yeah, you're not Google.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.180
You're not LinkedIn.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:46.880
You're not Facebook.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.120
You're not Netflix.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.820
There are people who actually that's an inaccurate statement about.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.680
There's plenty of people that work at those companies.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:19:00.020
But like you said, Carlton, the people who come along, they see these companies who they respect and say they must be doing it right.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:08.740
And so often with these deployment stories, with these design patterns, you know, should you have like separate caching servers that run like something like Redis?

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.640
Yes, you should.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.300
No, you shouldn't.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.040
And that's the right answer at the same time.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.720
But with the context that you need, right?

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.080
Are you trying to run 10,000 servers and let 500 people work on this project?

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.120
Or are you two people trying to do a startup?

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.080
Like those are not the same tradeoffs and balances you want to make, right?

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.360
Yeah.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.180
And it depends as well on your model.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.860
So one example that I really like is Stack Overflow.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.020
Now they're built entirely on the Microsoft stack.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.380
So they've got SQL Server and they're using .NET.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:41.920
But the basic point is they've got a really big database one and then, you know, a few worker processes in front of those.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.580
And that's it.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.160
It's a classic monolith.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.020
And they're one of the biggest sites on the internet.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.580
And yet they're incredibly fast.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.480
Yeah, exactly.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.840
As fast as you could ever want.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.300
Okay.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.020
They do it in this kind of monolith, old school style, you know, vertical scale.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:55.880
Make it just bigger.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.660
Don't spin out parallels.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.140
Just make the thing bigger.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.340
Buy a bigger database server.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.060
So that's, you're not going to be bigger than Stack Overflow, right?

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:04.420
Right.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.600
And then another example we have.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.500
And when you are, you'll reevaluate it anyway.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.860
Whatever you do now is not going to solve that problem.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:10.100
Yeah.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.920
But you're not going to be bigger than Stack Overflow.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.400
And then we had another example, which was Dr. On Demand.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.800
They came on, Matt Lehman from Dr. On Demand came on Django Chat recently.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.500
They've got a more containerized approach to it.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:28.000
But the thing is, they're doing peer-to-peer communication between, you know, many simultaneous peer-to-peer video communications.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.960
Because Dr. On Demand is like a telemedicine, right?

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.780
Right, right.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.000
Like, I need to book a video appointment with my doctor.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.740
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:44.660
And so, but they've got so many of those processes needed to be spun up that they need something which scales out and then back down again very easily.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.280
So they've got a kind of more, like, modern, more, a cooler technology.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.080
They're not as big as Stack Overflow probably in terms of raw traffic.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.740
But they need that flexibility of architecture.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.960
That's what we always think about, right?

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.820
We say, it depends.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.680
That's our timeline.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.080
Yeah, it depends.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.540
It depends.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.140
Yeah.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.440
Exactly.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.700
That's your subtitle.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.420
I do think the context, right?

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:12.020
When people talk about design patterns, deployment, architecture, those are always within a silent, not mentioned most of the time context in which that makes sense.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.420
And you've got to decide, are you in that context or are you not?

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.140
Yeah, no, entirely.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.880
I should say, what problems are you trying to solve?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.560
Like, you can't innovate everywhere.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.500
Like, there's so many pieces to a website.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.080
Do you want to innovate on deployment?

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.960
Not until you're, you know, Instagram, I don't think.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.520
No, well, I think that's a great point.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.880
And it's when you're small, the most important thing is adding features and going quick, right?

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.820
When you get bigger, the most important thing is to not go down, right?

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:45.360
If random little project that is like an ordering service for a restaurant in Milwaukee, if it goes down for half an hour, it's not ideal, but it's not the end of the world.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.060
If Google goes down for half an hour, people really notice.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.880
You know, it's like front page news type.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.500
So it's just a totally different thing.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:22:03.940
Now, before we move on to more deployment stuff, and we're kind of in there, I do, before we get away too far, maybe we could touch real quickly on some of the new features that are coming in 3.2 and like the Django 3 stuff that you guys are excited about.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.520
Yeah, maybe can you start with just 3 in general, Carlton?

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.800
Because I think that makes 3.2 have more context.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.280
Well, okay.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:14.660
So, but 3 introduced, 3 began the process for making Django async, right?

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:20.160
So we added, so historically, Python has this WSGI, the web service gateway interface.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.900
So Django is a WSGI framework.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.260
Flask is a WSGI framework.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:32.920
It was this standard so that application servers could talk to protocol servers, which could talk to the internet without, you know, each framework having to have its own protocol server.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:39.420
So Gunnicorn is a WSGI server, and it can speak to Flask, and it can speak to Django, and it can speak to any other WSGI server.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:39.660
Right.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:45.420
You can use that, and I can use micro WSGI, and it's, we don't have to coordinate or do anything.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.080
It just happens.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.320
That's because of the WSGI or WSGI thing, right?

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:49.600
Yeah.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.620
So that's the standard.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:57.640
And so in order to make things async, there's this thing called ASCII, which is the asynchronous gateway interface.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.120
I don't know.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:58.860
Yeah, I don't know.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.600
I don't really, yeah.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.280
Anyway, it's not WSGI, it's ASCII.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.280
So first of all, Django 3.0 brought in an ASCII handler.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.860
So it wasn't async at all, but you could run it under an ASCII server.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.240
And then 3.1 brought in actual async views.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:21.160
And you can define an async def view, and you can use, I don't know, HTTPX, which is like an asynchronous HTTP client with a request.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.420
Yeah, it's like requests, but async.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:23.720
Right.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.420
Or what's the ORM story?

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.280
Does that support async at await yet?

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:27.660
Right.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:27.940
No.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.280
So that's not there yet.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.920
So this is something that will develop probably over the course of the Django 4 lifestyle.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.520
So there's plans and there's thoughts.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:43.180
And we need to get to the point where you, with the ORM, where you can, down to your kind of filter call.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.880
And so things like filter, they can be totally synchronous because they don't actually do any IO.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.260
They don't actually hit the database.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:55.180
But when you then go, right, I've got my query set and I'm going to iterate it and I'm going to fetch the objects from the database.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.500
We need that bit.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.640
Even if the actual connection is run in a thread or whatever, we need that bit to be fully async.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.060
And then Django will feel async as it is.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.680
At the moment, if you write an async for you in Django, you kind of have to say, well, I'm not going to touch the DB.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.580
I'm not going to.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.120
Yeah.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:17.220
You can wrap the ORM in async to async wrapper, but you kind of lose the point of that.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:17.460
Yeah.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:17.660
Yeah.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.620
But that's coming, right?

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:18.960
Yeah.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.940
So Andrew, yeah.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:27.900
So Andrew Godwin, who's driving this effort, he gave a talk at DjangoCon Europe about the structuring of this and what it's going to look like.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.140
And it's like, yeah, that makes sense.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:29.840
This is going to work.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:40.840
And we don't have to get, what's nice is we don't have to get async all the way down to the very bottom because we can run the actual, we can sort of hand off the actual database connection in a thread executor.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.800
But from the outside of the ORM, it will look async.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:50.800
And then you can, you know, you can stream out your content records of maximum throughput as you want to, that kind of thing.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:50.900
Yeah.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.260
Well, the fact that you can already do external APIs.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:58.700
And if you're going down the microservice path, you can do your microservice calls with HTTPX and await those.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:24:59.940
That's already a huge step.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:24:59.960
Yeah.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.020
Yeah.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:10.140
So without, and this works, what's amazing about the way Andrew is just absolute hero, but he put it together in such a way that you can run this with a WSGI service.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.300
You're running Django 3.1 with GunnerCorn.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.140
Like you always have.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:14.220
Yeah.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:19.980
And you think to yourself, I just need to make a couple of API calls, but they're quite slow and I want to make them in parallel.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:26.820
You can do that just by writing an async def call and then, you know, making the parallel calls using HTTPX.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.480
And it just works.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.660
And Django does all the rest for you and adapts it.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.580
And you didn't have to change your application server.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.640
You didn't have to do, you know, it's just like, yeah, we've got async just there.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.920
One of the challenges if you're talking to the database is you say, okay, fine.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.720
The bottleneck was we are waiting at the web server level, at the Django level.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.760
And then we're going to push that down to the database.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.280
We're going to just make all that async.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.960
All of a sudden, all the pressure is now on the database, which can be a problem.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:57.020
But if you're talking external APIs, you're now pushing the pressure onto the internet, which is way scalable.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:57.560
Yeah.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.000
And it's always going to scale more than you, right?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.960
You're not going to need that many client requests probably.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.420
Yeah.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.960
Also, David Smith out there says 3.2 will be a great release.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.960
You guys have done a great job getting many patches over.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.680
Yeah, for sure.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.400
Thank you, David.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.680
Super.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.340
We were working really hard.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:19.160
We had two longer lists and we got, you know, one we had to bump for Django 4.0, but the rest we got in.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:19.900
So we were very good.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.840
Okay, so 3.0, acing it away.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840
This is a big deal.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.200
Yeah.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.060
And so those are the big features for 3.0.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.320
And then what's coming in 3.2, we've got various other bits and bobs.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.280
You can customize primary keys.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.620
So traditionally, they've just been autofield, which is in 32.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:38.840
Well, eventually, you know, if you get 22 billion of those or something, you can run out.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.220
So you can now customize that for big in.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:48.500
And over the next couple of releases, you know, major releases, we will make the default big in because that's probably what it should be in 64.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.760
Because then you're never going to run out of primary keys.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:57.280
But that's something that big sites run into that, especially if you start creating, I don't know, events, an event log.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:57.640
Yeah.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.180
You know, a site can generate a lot of events and they can add up quickly.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.040
You know, so.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.220
Yeah, they definitely can.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.900
Functional indexes in the ORM.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:11.880
So you can create an index on an expression like that these were greater than or that the sum of this was.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.500
And then you can query on those at full speed because they're indexed.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.580
That's a really big feature.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.020
Oh, really?

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.340
So you can do a query like the sum of the orders of this.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.040
The customer is greater than $100.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:22.440
Yeah.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.420
And that's a relationship.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:23.780
Yeah.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.740
And then you can create an index on that value.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.860
And you've been able to do that in raw SQL for, you know, any amount of time.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.000
But that's now exposed at the ORM level.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
And that's nice.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.380
That's awesome.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.020
You can just kind of.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:34.380
Yeah.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.440
For people who are doing reporting or that kind of thing.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:37.820
Yeah.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:38.380
That's massive.

then click that create free account button to get started.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.760
And then we've got, I don't know, a new memcache backend for the cache.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:56.060
We've got, you know, updating the API for using the admin for nice decorator API for creating various admin customizations.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.500
We've got themes in the admin.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.040
We're going to ship a dark thing.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.280
It's a big one for people to see right away.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:07.280
Because the Django admin could use a refresh and there's been all sorts of third-party ways to customize it,

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.940
but now be built in a bit more.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:09.600
There's all sorts.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.380
In the blog post for the author, I described it as a mess of new features.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.740
And that's exactly what it is.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.740
But what's nice is it's not, there aren't, apart from async, which is coming,

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.440
there aren't any new major features in Django, right?

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.580
It's 15 years old.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.900
It's rich and mature and largely feature complete.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:32.100
But each major release, each eight months, it always amazes me when we're drawing to get up the final release notes,

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:38.580
how much depth and extra, like, substance there is in the features that we've managed to add

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.640
and that have been contributed over that eight-month period.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.460
Yeah, that's fantastic.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:45.560
So I feel like you're capturing much of the modern Python awesomeness.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.360
One other area that's, I think, interesting.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.280
I have no idea what your plans are around it,

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.020
but maybe you could just give us your thoughts, is type hints, type annotations.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:54.440
Yep.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.240
That's difficult for us.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.440
Carl, about that a little bit.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.840
Yeah, I mean, that's difficult for us because Django, I mean, if you take the awesomeness,

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.760
it's super dynamic.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.060
And there's an amazing project, Django Stubs, where they've got stub files and they've got,

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.820
you know, they've done a super job.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.280
And it really does work well.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.480
So if you load up VS Code or PyCharm these days,

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:19.080
you get very good autocomplete around things like Django model field definitions.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:19.600
Yeah.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.360
And that's all powered by Django Stubs.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.100
Yeah.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.400
Which probably is powered by type hints underneath, right?

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.040
Yeah, yeah.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.620
It totally is.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.240
A year or so ago, there was some discussion about whether we would make those inline hints

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.540
in Django itself.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.340
And the technical board at the time said, no,

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:39.380
we need the typing technology to evolve a little bit further in Python itself before Django can

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.740
jump on and say, look, we endorse this particular technology.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.400
There is, there's various ways of doing it and various type hinting, type checkers and various.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.200
And so, so we, we favored mypy, which is obviously the endorsed one.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.120
Well, what about the others?

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.400
We can't support them all and they might change and-

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.520
PyWrite and all the different various initiatives.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:57.820
Yeah.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.420
We can't take it out once it's in.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.600
The thing with, the reason why people love Django is because it's super stable.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.580
You know, you write a site five years later, you don't really have to do very much to keep

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:06.920
it going.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.280
And so the technical board at the time said, no, we're not going to bring those type hints

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.800
into Django, but that will be reviewed.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.040
You know, we'll look at it again in a little while's time.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:21.140
One thing I will say about typing in all the peps, it says type hints remain optional.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.420
They're not meant to be compulsory, even by convention.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:27.280
Do you feel maintaining Django a certain pressure to have them?

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:33.900
I do worry that that optionality of type hints is perhaps undermined a little bit in the day

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.780
to day development.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:35.340
I'm not sure.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.000
I also code in Swift, right?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.620
Which is a fully statically typed.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.080
Swift is pretty strong in its syntax.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.840
Like you can't even null out.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.240
Yeah.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.880
Even if they could be, right?

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.600
If there's not allowed to be optional, explicit, there's a lot of interesting stuff happening

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.180
in the Swift type.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:49.420
Yeah.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.960
I mean, Swift is a fantastic language, but there's no option.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.260
It's type hints or it's type annotations all the way.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.940
And then when I come back to Python after a few hours of that, I'm like, oh, this is so

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.860
breath of fresh air.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.680
You know, the thing that I really, the comparison that I make a lot is between TypeScript, which

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.600
is type annotations for JavaScript and Python type hints.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:14.720
And I always walk away from TypeScript feeling like, ah, that was way harder than it should

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:14.880
have been.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.560
Why was it so frustrating and fighting me?

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.820
Whereas in Python, you might get some squigglies because you didn't quite define something just

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.380
right or it wasn't defined at all.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.920
But then it just, it carries on, right?

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.620
Whereas things that are completely, it must work within this context.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.220
They can become challenging, especially the reason I bring up TypeScript is the stuff that

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.820
it brings in is not necessarily typed, just like Python.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.520
Whereas Swift is end to end.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.460
It's all from scratch under that same system.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.380
So it's coherent.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:44.800
But bringing in, say, jQuery into TypeScript, like there's no TypeScript jQuery.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.960
I know there's like stubs you can put on and whatnot, but like that kind of stuff is more

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.740
Python-like.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.140
And so I think it's pretty interesting.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:51.560
Yeah.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.560
And Django's in that very much in that boat where it was never written with type hints in

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:55.760
mind.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.920
Yeah, of course they didn't exist.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.820
And if you look at Django stubs, it's awesome.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.220
But a lot of the things are like string or any.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.880
And it's like, that's horrible, right?

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.060
You don't want to write that every single time.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:07.740
That's an issue.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.940
And then another thing I see, which I'm not sure about, sometimes they make a type like

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.820
a model, the Django model admin, they make it a generic that takes the model type, which

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.200
tells you what it's the admin of.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.900
And I remember, and I look at that and I wince a little bit.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.200
You're like back to C++ templates or something, right?

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.360
And I see where they're going with that.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.020
It's amazing what they've been able to do there.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.520
But I remember coding Objective-C UI Table View, say.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:36.100
And what you would always do is you get object, your row class in from the UI Table View delegate

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.620
where you're getting a list of cells, right?

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.060
So like a list of email messages.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.940
And you'd immediately cast it to the type you wanted so that you knew what you were dealing

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:44.100
with.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:44.400
Yeah.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.580
In a way, when I get something back from a model admin, I'm quite happy to write colon

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.660
model name.

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:49.960
Yeah.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.560
To tell the editor what it's meant to be.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.240
To tell the type checker what it's meant to be.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.000
And then for the rest of the method, I get the autocomplete.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
I get the type checking.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.220
And you probably don't put any more type hints because it's just now flows.

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.240
And it's, I agree.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.680
It's so good at generating, like allowing you to generate code incredibly fast if the tool

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.180
supports it.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:13.400
One quick comment or thought that before we move on, this having types around the ORM

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.680
is really interesting because all the big ORMs seem to do the same basic flow.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:22.660
You know, I'm thinking, you know, Django ORM, SQLAlchemy, even NoSQL ones like Mongo Engine,

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:23.240
which I use.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.860
They all have a class which has the columns defined as descriptors.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.400
So at definition time, they create the tables or the collections.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:36.120
And then at runtime, they become the scalar versions of the thing they say they are, right?

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.120
That an integer column is now actually an integer.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:45.120
So what I've done when I define the model class is say like name colon str equals string

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:45.540
column.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:51.260
And so the Python thinks it's all the types are actually what I said, the primary types like

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:51.960
in the model.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.580
And then the underlying ORM can do what it needs to do.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:59.960
But, you know, the rest of my code is like, oh, that's a float column right there or float

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:00.220
field.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.260
That's been really helpful.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:01.920
I don't know.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.200
I haven't run into any problems doing that, but it's been pretty helpful.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:05.440
Yeah.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.860
I mean, it's the thing that brings my talk.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.340
Well, there's data classes, right?

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.540
Which they brought in in 3.7 or 3.8.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:11.940
Yeah.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.880
And then Pydantic is an exciting thing, which is...

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.720
Pydantic is fantastic.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.020
Yeah.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.560
You define a model, call it a model with exactly this.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.280
It's like field name type with an annotation string or int or whatever.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.560
And that works really well.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:31.080
And I can imagine us generating Django ORM models from that kind of thing.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.800
But then you end up needing options.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.440
Like, is it nullable?

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.620
Or is it, you know, is it required?

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.380
Is it...

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.920
What validators does this field have?

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.140
And then it starts...

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:45.000
When you start to add validation, it starts to look almost like what we've got now.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.940
I mean, Pydantic's got one good advantage in raw serialization speed.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.700
It's very fast.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.240
So that's something we can learn.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.140
But the short answer is, I don't know.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.640
But it's exciting times, isn't it?

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.820
It's very exciting times.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.400
All right.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.620
Let's talk really quickly about maintaining your content or things that you generate.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:06.620
Like, you guys all write articles, books, do online stuff, even podcasts.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.220
So 3.2 is out.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:08.900
What broke?

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.560
Like, real quickly, Will, maybe you want to just talk about what you've been doing to...

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:18.080
Yeah, there's a reason why there's very up-to-date Django books, because the release cycle of every

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.220
nine months doesn't overlap with the traditional publisher cycle.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.280
So for me, I mean, I'm on version, I think, five for most of the books.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.900
So I was on 110 or 111.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.280
So it's sort of like writing the book again.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:36.580
Every time I basically go through from scratch, because all the code is linked to the text.

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.560
Because I'm self-published, I can do all that.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.580
I have my flow down.

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.140
So really, I have a list of new features I know that are in there.

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.700
So I'll play around with them to make sure that things don't break.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.520
And then I'm constantly emailing with readers.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.240
So I have feedback on what works and what doesn't.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.740
So half the new features are fixing things so it's smooth.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.940
And then half just making the text.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.100
So at this point, I feel pretty good about the flow of all three.

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.720
And people will say, what about this?

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.100
And maybe I can explain it a little bit better.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:08.780
I added, I mean, so for a 3.1 added in the beginner's book, I really wanted to have proper

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.620
deployments, but not go as deep as I do in the professional's book.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:17.980
So I did introduce environment variables and showed, I think, a pretty elegant way to get

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.980
environment variables and to have some lockdown for deployed site.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:26.040
Whereas before in beginners, it was just sort of like the local version, which is pretty open,

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.860
was what you deployed because it was more about getting something up.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.520
I was able to introduce environment variables.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.840
We could talk about that more.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.000
There's a third party package.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.440
It's great.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.540
So that's always the tension for me is showing and telling, right?

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.300
Like I want to explain everything, but I don't want to overwhelm people.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.660
And so that's part of the thing I have to think about for 3.1.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:48.360
And I think also for Django being so stable, at least you can say all the stuff is still

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.160
the same.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.520
There's just new features we haven't mentioned or a new way maybe is better, but as opposed

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.840
to this does not work anymore.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.440
Well, it's the difference between what trips the professional programmer and someone who's

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:58.740
new.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:05.340
So for example, in 3.1, the pathlib was added when you create a new Django project, the settings.py

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.040
file, which is the default settings.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.320
The way the routes are done is a little bit different.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.700
Like a minute stack overflow thing for someone who's used to using Django.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.740
or the breaking stuff, but that can completely derail a beginner.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.800
There's usually a couple of things like that.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.300
You know, so in that case, like I have a dedicated blog post because I knew that was coming.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.940
And just this morning, I got more questions around it.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:29.620
So it's that's sort of the thing that fun me is figuring out how do I, you know, be compassionate

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:34.040
to the true beginners, but we're more further along.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.120
It's a lot of work to do.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.420
I don't know how you could do it.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:36.940
I don't either.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.120
I was just dealing with some GitHub issues on some folks who are having trouble because a

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.500
mismatch of pip upgrades and other packages.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.160
And it's just like, it's just how it goes.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.320
Real quick, John from the live stream is really excited about the admin themes.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.520
So that's really cool that that is going to come along.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.060
Thanks, Sean.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.480
They add up to greatness.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.080
I think that's, I love that.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.940
Yeah, that's a great, great say.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:38:59.240
All right.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.860
We talked a lot about deployment already, which is why I've been dancing around a bit.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.500
But let's go ahead and talk about deployment.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:10.580
So when I create a web application with Django or really honestly with Flask or anything, I've

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.320
got a cool app.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.920
But it's, you know, web apps are not generally meant for the individual.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.960
They are meant to go on the internet and be amazing and connect things and allow other people

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.480
to do stuff.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.040
And that's a huge gap, right?

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.700
So maybe I've just learned how to do Django.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:28.700
You just talked about your beginner's book, Will, and I finally got that one page that

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.180
wouldn't show.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.800
And the database stopped, you know, crashing when I did that one query because I checked

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.400
for none now and it's all good.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.900
Wait, I have to learn Linux and I have to become an admin and what the heck just happened, right?

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.060
So how do you guys approach that?

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.740
What do you tell that person?

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.100
Yeah.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:52.160
First of all, hand on shoulder, I feel you because it's just there's this massive deployment

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:52.580
gap.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.500
We've got the Django tutorial.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.940
We've got the Django girls tutorial.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.820
We've got the Django rest framework tutorial.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:58.680
People have done those.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.560
They've got their app together.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.840
They've come up with some ideas.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.560
They've learned a teeny bit of JavaScript to make it that bit better.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.760
And now put it online.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.900
And exactly this, I've got to learn Linux.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.020
Oh my word.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:08.560
Yeah.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.580
Among other things.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:10.840
I mean, it's two things though, right?

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.100
I think, I think like when I think about this, oh, there's, there's two ways to think

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:14.340
about it.

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.700
One is making it friendly, which we can talk about.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.420
And then there's the specifics of, do I, you know, do I do it on a VPS?

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.040
Do I do it on a pass?

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.660
So there's two separate things.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:29.120
The first one, I think we can generalize and Django has some good notes on that.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.060
The second one is sort of a deep end of opinion.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:36.440
I guess I'm in favor of like, I use, I'm a big fan of platforms.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:40.500
If somebody had something that like hosted AWS for Django, I would use that.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.160
I mean, so, and I'm just going to throw it in here now.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.920
I'm working on a app for this exact problem.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.020
It's called button.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.220
It's btn.dev.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:55.040
And it's the idea is to be able to spin up a small environment for this exact.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.460
I just want to get my app on line use case without, you know, you're having to become

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.340
a sysadmin expert.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.500
Yeah. So the spectrum looks like to me pass, right?

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:08.940
Platform as a service, which you said you like Heroku and there's other options as well.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.020
Yeah. Heroku, DigitalOcean.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.060
Then I think maybe button is even before that.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:14.860
I'm not entirely sure.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.000
Like in terms of complexity.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:16.760
Let me jump in.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.200
You've got the platform as a service.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.720
You've got Heroku, which is there at one end.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.500
And that's kind of like, they'll run your app, but they don't, that's it.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.140
Right. Or, you know, you can run another worker instance, but then you say to yourself,

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.320
I want to, I just want to put a file online.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.780
And it's like, well, how on earth do I do that?

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.900
I can't. Or I want to put up a static website.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.600
So I've got to bring in, I know, Netlify because another service.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.920
Yeah. Netlify is really nice for just pure static sites.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.260
Actually.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:40.720
Yeah.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.700
It is. It's awesome.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.900
But then all of a sudden you're running two services and then you want to do some log analysis.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.480
So you've got to bring in and it's like, oh, hang on.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.020
I've got three services now running and it's, it gets a bit out of hand.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:56.500
So then on the other hand, you've got AWS and you go to AWS and it's like, oh my word.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.160
You know, it's the paradox of choice.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.720
It's just like that in Azure.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.320
I mean, they're both incredibly powerful, but it's just like, oh my goodness.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.480
Look at this admin dashboard.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.400
Like I, there's huge thing with a 50 choices.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:11.400
I go into one and it expands into 20 and then I need to figure out the right one of those 20.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.960
It's just, it's mind boggling.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.640
Yeah, exactly.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:19.480
And so where button fits in that is it's on AWS, but it provides a very simplified environment.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.960
This is because it's part tool.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.560
It's a tool to do it, but also a guide that says, look, this is how you should deploy.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:29.620
So the app puts together the environment for how you should deploy your Django app or, you

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:34.040
know, you can do any app, but you know, I begin with Django because that's where obviously

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:34.540
what I know.

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:39.280
And then the difference between, well, why wouldn't I, why would I use that instead of

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.660
a platform as a service like Kuroka?

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:44.340
Well, because if you go out of it, it's just AWS.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.740
And so you can go on and move on to other things and you can export to.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:51.880
When you do go closer to now you are kind of Google or whatever.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.020
You've got a growth path.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:57.180
Obviously not, not far down that road, but a little ways you can go, oh, we actually need

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.040
to do this other thing.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:58.300
Yeah.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.700
And so that's what I'm aiming for.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.860
And that that's launching very soon.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.760
It'd be early access by the middle of February.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.240
You know, beta by end of the quarter.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.540
And then what I call version, what ends the beach?

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:09.960
I don't know.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.960
End of the year, I would imagine.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.200
Yeah.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:11.680
Yeah.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.640
That sounds really cool.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.540
We'll definitely link to it in the show notes.

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:20.380
When I was pausing there, I said, okay, well, on one end we have pass like Heroku and other

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.700
platform as a service options.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.920
What is the other end?

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:28.060
Is the other end Linux virtual machines or is the other end Kubernetes clusters?

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.580
It's Kubernetes cluster.

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.660
It's well beyond virtual machines, right?

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.880
So like to spin up a virtual machine is not a problem.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:40.860
The problem is that you get a bare OS and then you've got to do all the app to get installed

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.180
to turn it into something you can deploy on.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:43.380
Right.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.380
And then you do that once.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.780
And then the second problem is that six months later you need to upgrade it and you've got

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.040
to replace that VM.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.320
So that's very difficult.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.280
And I think that's what leads people into this kind of world of containers.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.680
And then into containers, it's like, oh, well, I've got, I need an orchestration platform

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:04.740
to, ah, and that's, there are people who make a career doing that.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:05.040
Yeah.

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.740
You can't expect to do that sensibly.

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:07.580
I agree with Carlton.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:11.640
It depends slightly in that, like, so in my professionals book, we, I show how to use Docker

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.120
and Docker is for a smaller site.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:19.880
I think actually you can put your containers online so you can, in a lot of different flow

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.960
is actually quite nice.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.840
But I agree with Carlton's broader point about, you know, that is and all the rest.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.600
It's, I feel like is the goal.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.220
I'm setting up a Kubernetes cluster and I'm running the data layer and I'm running the caching

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:30.540
layer.

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:35.660
And I'm, if you're managing that whole thing in a cluster, you're at the far right end

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.020
of the most complicated.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:42.900
But if I'm going to deploy to a hosted Kubernetes container and consume a database as a service

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.440
and a caching tier as a service, then it starts to fall back to, well, I just get my

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.740
container to run and plug in these connection strings and we're good to go.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.180
I think there's, it can kind of live on both sides, honestly.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:55.540
There's different approaches and different sweet spots for each individual.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:45:00.220
The difference for me is you can containerize your application and run it up, but where do

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.240
you container that to?

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.460
Where do you run that container?

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:07.380
Is that on a set of VMs, which you provisioned yourself and put a container management system

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:07.960
on like Kubernetes?

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.480
Or is that on somebody else?

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.700
Like, is it basically service, the Cloud Run?

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:17.240
Cloud Run takes your container and runs it and you don't know anything about where it's

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:17.460
running.

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.420
So that's more like a platform as a service again.

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:21.060
Yeah, it is.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.100
It falls back in that.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.300
So Will said he's a fan of Heroku.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.960
Carlton, let me ask you this question.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:31.300
If you were writing an application in Django that was expected to get 5 million data-driven,

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:36.600
like proper requests, not for CSS and whatnot, but proper requests a month, how would you deploy

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.000
it right now?

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:43.200
I would deploy it on a pretty big VM with as many process workers as I need.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.700
So I'd put stick Nginx as my front end.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:50.200
Perhaps I'd probably use something like application load balance in front of it, one of these things

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.880
that AWS will provide or Azure have got their equivalent load balancer.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.620
Then I'd have my Nginx, which is serving my static files.

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.400
Behind that, I'd probably have two, three.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.400
It's also doing SSL, for example, right?

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.780
Your Let's Encrypt bits.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:02.020
Yeah.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:02.580
Yeah, yeah.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.100
And they're handing all certificate renewals and all of that kind of thing, which is probably

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.000
worth the money because it only takes you a few minutes.

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:12.780
But you forget and then your site goes down and no, just hand all that stuff off.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.260
So I'd put that on a nice size VM.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:19.920
I'd have, you know, three, four, five Gunnicorn workers serving the application instances,

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.260
load balanced behind Nginx.

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:28.440
And then I'd have Postgres on a decent size RDS, which is a managed database service behind

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:28.640
it.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:34.620
As a first preference, I would scale up the VM and I would scale up the RDS rather than-

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.540
Way before you scale out.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.200
Yeah, way before I scale out.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:37.800
Yeah, I agree.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.360
Like if you can, as soon as you have them scaled out, it gets tricky, right?

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.140
You become, it takes you up a notch in that DevOps story.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:48.760
At that point, you're hiring, you know, an extra hand just to manage the ops, an extra

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:49.920
hand to manage the ops.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.080
Yeah.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.360
It's like, well, what was the revenue of the application that justified that the salary and

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.980
the social security of that extra hand?

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:56.160
Yeah.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.180
I mean, maybe you're like, well, I don't really want to pay for that larger VM that's $80 a

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.020
month instead of $10 a month.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:08.060
But if the alternative is now we spend human hours on making, you know, three $10 VMs run,

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:12.780
you know, it's so easy for businesses to become Pennywise pound foolish around these kinds

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:13.520
of things, right?

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.160
It's just like, oh, we can't get you a new monitor, a new keyboard.

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.000
Like, really?

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.680
You pay me like $80,000 a year and you won't give me a new keyboard to be more productive?

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.500
Or I feel like that's the deployment equivalent of that.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:24.740
Yeah.

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.520
No, it's penny pinching for no reason.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.620
I mean, the other great example is Sentry, right?

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:33.120
So Sentry is your kind of, you log all your errors to it, send your exceptions to it.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.380
It gives you great stack traces and it links it back to GitHub.

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:35.880
It's awesome.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.120
Why would you not have this?

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:41.780
And then you're on the free account, you know, it'd give you 5,000 events a month or something.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.720
And it's like, oh, we need 30 bucks to get onto the, like the million events a month.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.820
The manager's like, no, you can't have paid Sentry.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:48.600
You're like, what?

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.980
What are you talking about?

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.580
So then you stop logging.

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.920
You're like, well, we can't log that event because of Sentry.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.540
And then you're blind.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:00.060
And then your app goes down and you spend four hours trying to work out what it is while you're losing business.

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.340
Like, that was 30 bucks a month for Sentry.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.140
Just pay it.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:08.260
But I think it depends if your manager has felt that pay as an individual contributor themselves, right?

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.480
Because if they haven't, then yeah, stop complaining, developer, you know?

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:17.000
But yeah, you should, I always thought, I mean, at Quizlet, which is now like half of all high school students,

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.420
we had a joint, which I hope they're still around.

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.700
They're a hosting company, but we were having scaling issues.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.280
They came in and we had the whole team CTO, which was great.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.740
And, you know, at the end of the day, they were just like, you need bigger hardware, you know?

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:29.880
Get more hardware.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:34.940
If you can get more, you know, and as a business person, if you can throw money at a scaling problem,

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.180
like, yeah, that's the easiest money you've spent.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:37.520
Yeah.

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:44.540
You know, so what I'm doing right now, Carlton, is I'm running Nginx on Ubuntu, but I'm using MicroWhisgee.

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:50.020
And I came across this, although as I'm starting to think about the ASGI stuff,

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:56.280
Gunicorn, Genicorn, and like UVicorn worker processes is starting to look like a really awesome thing.

00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:00.600
But what I wanted to point out is there's this great article by the Bloomberg tech folks

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.480
talking about configuring MicroWhisgee for production.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.700
And man, do they have a bunch of good little tips of like, well, here's all these things,

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:13.100
but oh, did you know if you turn on like enable threads versus not, or if you set single interpreter

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:18.000
mode to true, you automatically get better performance because it was configured to potentially run

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.800
like Python 3.7 and 3.8 at the same time.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.300
And you're never going to do that in one process, most likely.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:30.400
And there's just all these really fantastic settings and like vacuum and whatnot to clean up sockets and whatnot.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.660
So people, if they're running MicroWhisgee in production, they should absolutely check that out.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:38.080
That's a really, I read it a bunch of the way I was doing things after reading that one.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.620
Just scroll to the image at the top, if you would please, Michael, because a little diagram that I had.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:41.900
Yeah.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.800
But like, yeah, so that looks almost exactly how I deploy.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.220
Like Nginx in front of a worker process, you know, that's running your Python applications

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.380
and, you know, talking to your database.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:52.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.380
It's, it's pretty standard.

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:53.840
Yeah.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:54.840
They got memcached in there.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.320
So I'd, I'd have Redis instead of memcached, but same deal.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:57.620
Yeah.

00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:01.840
There's a comment about, does EC2 sit between a VPS and Kubernetes?

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.080
Yeah.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.840
Since you're AWS expert.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.180
Okay.

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:10.740
Well, I don't know about expert, but so, but on AWS, like you, this is what I haven't found in AWS.

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:15.500
Like I would love to love their light sale product, but it just seems totally uncared where they,

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.280
they kind of manage the cluster all for you.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.840
But on the, the, I can't even remember what the cluster services called, but the,

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.740
you have to provision the EC2 instances and you can do it quite easy.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:28.680
It's not hard to do, but you have to spin those up and they're kind of your responsibility.

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:32.060
And then it will run the cluster service on top of it.

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.340
The Kubernetes on top of it.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.080
And then you deploy your containers in there.

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:40.280
This is where something like Cloud Run is a bit easier because you don't have that layer of I'm

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.660
provisioning the, the underlying instances myself.

00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:47.200
And you have to choose the size of them and you can scale them up easily enough, but you

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.720
know it's, it's, it's non-trivial to set up a cluster on AWS.

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.080
Yeah.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.800
That's always been my feeling as well.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.480
I also feel like you're sort of committed to their hosted services.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.080
And if for some reason you don't want to use them, the step is not a tiny bit more.

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.540
It's a bigger, a much bigger step to like try to rework that.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:03.940
Yeah.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:09.700
The example is run, you can run your own Postgres on EC2 instances when, you know, you can provision

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:13.140
the disks and you can do all that rather than RDS.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:17.640
And for me, I'm like, okay, if you've got a very specialist use case, then yeah, do that.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.860
But RDS is great.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:19.500
Just use RDS.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:24.040
Just use the hosted service because again, you're saving money and yet it's a bit more expensive

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:28.660
hour, but not as expensive as you, your time, your life force.

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:28.940
Yeah.

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.740
Well, I think also it depends, right?

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:37.400
Are you one single person who is building up an idea and you have zero revenue and you're

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.540
just trying to do this for two hours a week to see if you can get a little tiny bit of traction.

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.780
Maybe it is worth an extra five hours, right?

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:48.140
Versus I have actual money coming in the door and I'm trading out building this feature or

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.560
that feature.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.760
Like those are really very different contexts.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:56.080
Also though, you get yourself a Raspberry Pi and you can install Nginx on it and Postgres

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:56.580
on it.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.560
And no, but you can run all those, right?

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:03.200
And you can do it locally and you can bet you can run a Apache bench again against it and

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.940
you, it will serve plenty.

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.760
So you can get not the nano one, but yeah, sure.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.080
But you can get, you can run Postgres is my point.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:17.280
You don't need RDS to run a small Postgres, but if you're running a slightly bigger one, then

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.220
yeah, use RDS.

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:23.020
And then if you're a specialist and you really need to customize your Postgres somehow,

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:23.640
then okay.

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.000
Yeah.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.960
You know, spin up the EC2, install Postgres on it and customize it to your heart's content.

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.400
But that's well beyond my skill level.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:30.940
And yeah.

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.620
This is why they have hundreds or thousands of employees, right?

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:36.100
Like when people say, why do the big companies do that?

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:40.960
It's like, well, why does Instagram have a thousand, whatever thousand engineers when Carlton,

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:44.560
you and I could spin up a, you know, a prototype relatively quickly.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.860
It's like, because we're not dealing with the traffic they are.

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:52.380
And so it just gets exponentially harder, which is why you need a lot of people for all these

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:52.700
issues.

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:53.200
Absolutely.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:57.740
Will, you mentioned something really interesting there that I would like to just touch on for

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:58.200
a moment.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.500
Then we're getting short on time.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.340
You said you could run SQLite.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.740
Oh, well, so that Carlton has a good story about SQLite.

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.920
I mean, about how it's, so generally people say, well, you can't use it.

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.000
You shouldn't use it at all.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.200
But there are some cases where that's not the case.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.560
I mean, if it's a read heavy application, you can probably get away with it.

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.920
Simon Wilson's doing a lot with data set.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.200
Yeah.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.720
I just had him on the show.

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.740
His episode just came out this week, actually.

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:21.020
Yeah.

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:21.760
He's great.

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.480
And that is such a cool project.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:28.080
I feel like that is actually an undersold story for the beginners, right?

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:34.000
Because deployment of web application often means deployment of web application plus database

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000
server, plus backups of database server, plus like all of a sudden it goes from, you know,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.560
20% to 90% hard or whatever, right?

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:46.540
Or you go to hosted and you're like, okay, well, I still got to backup that thing potentially.

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:49.800
And, you know, there's just, you've got potential migrations.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.180
I don't know.

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:51.200
There's a lot of stuff going on.

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:55.940
And if you can say, well, until you actually get much traffic, you can just say, here's

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:59.580
the DB file and the SQLite connection on the one machine that I have.

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.320
And you back up that file every now and then, that might be a good story.

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:05.500
If the alternative is it's too much for me to get my app out.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:05.840
Yeah, yeah.

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:06.300
No, definitely.

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:11.160
Especially if it's a blog or a content site, like a shop catalog where it's all read only

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.820
and, you know, maybe you're using the admin to manage the content on it.

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:18.960
If it's only one person using the admin, you're not going to have concurrent rights, which

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.440
is the thing about SQLite.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.320
And so it's never going to be an issue.

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.540
And it is fast.

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:24.020
It's fast.

00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:26.140
Read only workloads.

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:26.760
It's fast.

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.500
It's fast enough.

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.660
It's yeah, it's very fast.

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:29.640
Yeah, you can use it.

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.560
And there's no server for people who don't understand are not totally aware.

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.480
Like it comes with Python and it runs in process.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.720
There's no other server to set up and connect to.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:38.120
Yeah.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:42.160
So Carlton correct me on that at one point, because I was saying, oh yeah, no SQLite.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.680
And he was, so I have to give credit to Carlton for there are some instances.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.200
Here's the secret about SQLite.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.780
It's got a writer headlock.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:57.180
A wow mode, which means that actually you've got a good chance of being able to do kind

00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:02.140
of concurrent rights to Django's ORM has got a retry value, which if you set that, you know,

00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:03.580
you know, a little bit higher.

00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:07.180
If it gets database locked, it will try again in a second.

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:10.540
And then, you know, you can go quite a long way enabling these things.

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:16.100
And then when you finally in production actually get a database was locked error, then you could

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:16.880
think, you know what?

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.240
I think it's time we move to post.

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:18.500
Yeah.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.060
In my world, I'm running MagaDB as the database.

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:24.040
And it doesn't make sense to consider running that on SQLite.

00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:28.620
But I can remember back when I first started deployment, like, okay, well, I got to learn Linux.

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.520
I got to learn Ingenx.

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.480
I got to learn MicroWisgee.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.160
Like, okay, what other deployment?

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:35.600
Like, how do I have to learn running my database on these things?

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.880
There's just, there was a lot.

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.960
And I can definitely see if you could say, well, here's an intermediate step to get it

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:41.700
out and get it going.

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.960
And then you just change the connection string at some point over to a big separate server.

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.360
I think that's a really good path.

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.080
It's a little bit like, you know, raw SQL versus Django models.

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:56.080
This is timely because I've had a thread emailing with a reader who doesn't quite, has something

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:56.520
in mind.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:59.260
And he's like, I modeled it all out, the scheme all out in SQL.

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:03.600
And SQL is easy to learn the basics and really hard at scale.

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:09.240
And while Django lets you write SQL, you really, really, really should resist doing that unless

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.620
you're a way better programmer than I am.

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:16.100
So whereas before you would have to learn tons of stuff, the same thing with deployment,

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:21.140
you can get a lot of the way there by trusting someone who says, until you need it, don't

00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:21.500
bother.

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:23.160
The same thing with database stuff.

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:27.560
Like, okay, you know, do some basic SQL, understand a little bit of the relations, but that's the

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.680
power of the Django ORM is that it will handle so much of this for you.

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:34.540
And if you think you need to go custom, unless, you know, if you have any doubts, you shouldn't

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:34.880
do it.

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:35.260
Yeah.

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:39.780
And the migration side, that's a huge part of a challenge if you were maintaining it yourself.

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.120
Yeah.

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:40.360
Yeah.

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:45.440
I mean, I was, you know, Andrew, Andrew was responsible for the, doing most of the, a lot

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.380
of the async stuff now.

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:46.800
Nice.

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.560
All right, guys, we're getting short on time, but I do want to just really quickly cover

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.260
one more thing.

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:52.600
Servers up and running, feels like it works.

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.700
I watched it all day.

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:54.240
It was fine.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.100
I want to walk away from my desk.

00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:59.860
I want to know that it's probably still fine.

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:03.160
And to me, like Carlton, you already talked about one thing.

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:06.780
There's some really great monitoring services that you integrate at the API level.

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.020
Like you plug in as a library to your code.

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.560
Sentry being one of them.

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.160
They're really great.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.460
They sponsored the show for a while.

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:13.560
Thanks for that as well.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.000
But I use Sentry on.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:15.980
Yeah, they're great.

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:19.360
And I, I've got Sentry running on my apps and every now and then I'll get an email.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:24.720
And a lot of, at this point, when I first integrated that type of service, I got a lot of, oh, I

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:25.540
didn't know that was happening.

00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:26.060
Oh crap.

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:27.120
I'm going to have to fix that.

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.420
Well, that's why there's a lot of logging and stuff, right?

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:29.780
Yeah.

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:30.420
Yeah, absolutely.

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:34.820
And once I kind of dialed in now, it's more like, well, somebody tried to send like some

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:39.060
binary hacky thing that broke the URL parsing, but it's not really a problem.

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:39.840
It's just right.

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.080
But having that thing there is, is really important.

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:43.560
I think.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.760
Yes, absolutely.

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.440
Absolutely.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.160
Sentry.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.560
I, I just can't see a reason not to use it.

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.980
Even if they've got the free plan.

00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.060
Why wouldn't you have that?

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:51.240
Yeah.

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:54.540
The free tier, like once you run out, you can decide whether or not you want to pay for it.

00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:59.040
But, you know, at least get, get us some kind of insight into the errors that are happening.

00:57:59.040 --> 00:57:59.460
Yeah.

00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:01.820
The other thing that I'm a fan of is Prometheus.

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:05.920
It takes a teeny bit of setting up, but again, you can get yourself a Raspberry Pi and you

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.780
can play with that locally.

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:07.560
And it's not that hard.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.780
You can put it on your Mac or you put it on your Windows machine.

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.820
It will run, but get a Raspberry Pi, set it up, monitor the device.

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.040
Prometheus is good fun.

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.260
There's a dashboard that goes with it called Grafana.

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:21.440
And then they do a log thing called Locky, which, you know, you have to configure it yourself,

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:23.720
but it teaches you about your application.

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.920
You have to say, okay, I want to monitor this.

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:30.500
And then you can put a little couple of tags in and then, okay, you get metrics then for

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:30.980
that bit.

00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.920
So, you know, perhaps you've got a slow view.

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:38.540
So one thing you can do is you can put on your Nginx logs, you can log the upstream response

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:39.000
time.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.560
So you've handed off to Garnicorn or to Microwiskey and Nginx will then log how long those responses

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:44.840
took.

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:48.300
And then you can say, well, actually that those responses to that particular request is taking

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:48.860
a long time.

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:52.420
And then on that request, you can go into that view and you can add a little, you know,

00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:56.460
a little bit of instrumentation and then you can start getting metrics for what that view

00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:57.000
is doing.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.100
And yeah, yeah.

00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.100
You know, that's really good.

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.760
He does over all of you guys.

00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:00.940
Yeah.

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.180
I'm also a fan of Datadog.

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.460
I think those sound pretty similar.

00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:03.960
Okay.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.000
I think they're Boston based actually, but yeah, they do.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.020
They call it APM application process monitoring.

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:11.840
And so there's quite a lot of commercial solutions.

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.240
And then Prometheus is the sort of DIY.

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:14.980
Nice.

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:15.560
Equivalent.

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:16.420
Okay, cool.

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:18.840
So that's the errors and performance.

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:22.080
The other side is just the website is down, right?

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.340
So maybe there's so many different layers and moving parts.

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:29.180
For example, like we have very little downtime with our train courses and stuff.

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:33.660
But one thing that did happen is we have this thing that will take the main IP address and

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:38.460
switch it to a failover server so we can do reboots and patches and then it'll switch it

00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:38.780
back.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:41.360
And that's all done through an API through like a get push.

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.020
And then it all just sort of goes down the chain.

00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:49.360
Well, at one point there was a bug where that switch of the IP like disassociated it with either

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.020
server.

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.680
So the server thought it was fine.

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.180
It's like, well, things are chill, right?

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:53.700
Right.

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.500
So you log in and it's like, yeah, no problem.

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.840
But the site was just timing out or so.

00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:58.620
I don't remember what happened,

00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:59.400
but it wasn't good.

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:04.500
So I think there's some really nice uptime monitoring things that are free that people

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.320
should just plug in to go hit these three pages just to see.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.280
I can talk to the site.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.060
It talks to the database and the answer comes back.

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:10.700
Yeah, for sure.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.860
I mean, I've got those configured.

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.680
I was I know we're almost out of time.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.720
I did want to mention on deployment.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:18.780
I think one thing that trips people up, especially around Django is static files, which is something

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:23.620
if you're doing it, you know, VPS, you know, and I think the key thing is that

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:28.600
your server doesn't want to run your static files like it can ways to do it.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:32.880
But, you know, so both within Django, Django out of the box defaults to local settings.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.760
And the Django has a local server.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.980
They'll just run your static files to put that into point and deployment.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.540
You would run collect static, which is a command that makes a single static file.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.360
And you probably want to use something like white noise.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.780
But there's a couple of steps there.

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:49.980
But something that really sort of intermediate level Django people, it really trips them up.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.260
I have a blog post on that because I forget the commands.

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:53.500
There's like four things to tweak.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.880
You just have to do every time.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.760
It works locally.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.920
Why doesn't it work live?

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.620
And it's like partly because people don't understand, you know, how their server is working because

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.600
they don't have to.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.700
But, you know, that's I just want to.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:05.720
Yeah.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:05.980
Awesome.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:06.180
Yeah.

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.100
One of the big four.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:07.320
Right.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.720
So get your code in place.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.580
However you do that.

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:10.720
Tab or get pulled.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.360
You know, whatever.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.080
How do you get it there?

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.600
Configure your virtual environment.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.780
You know, so in pip installed all your requirements.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:19.920
Configure your database and make sure you connect to that and get your static files in place.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.700
Database is the other one that, you know, well, you know, this might go like beginners.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.740
They're like, well, I updated it locally and I pushed my code.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.940
Why isn't my production database different?

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:29.440
Right.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.660
And it is like I still occasionally make that mistake, you know, just but, you know, your code

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.540
is not your two separate databases.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.520
Yeah, absolutely.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.840
That's what you want as well.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.000
You want to be able to write your blog post in locally and then it appear on your server.

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:46.920
You don't want to have to go, oh, no, now I have to paste it into the admin on my remote.

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.520
Yeah, it depends how automated you want to go.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:53.560
I mean, for a simple like so my learn Django site, which is basically one admin, largely

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.260
a content site.

01:01:54.260 --> 01:02:00.540
I mean, in terms of easy peasy, it's just Django and I've got Cloudflare in front and it's done.

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:01.940
It's super fast.

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:04.020
I get, you know, decent amount of traffic.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.180
I don't have to think about it.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.640
I've got I think I've got PagerDuty, one of those, you know.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.460
Yeah.

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:12.420
Yeah, that's the one that tells you if it's completely unreachable, right?

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:12.900
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:17.280
But it's an external one that, you know, exactly to your point, because you can't always trust

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:17.620
yourself.

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:17.920
Yeah.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.360
Yeah.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.340
There's some interesting ones.

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:21.180
I use status cake and it's neat.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:25.000
But there's some one that I heard the Dan Bader was telling me about that would sound a lot

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.880
nicer, but I'm like, but this one's already set up.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.240
You know, it's not that important.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.500
I get I get notifications.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.600
If it goes down, I'm all good.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.620
It's plumbing, right?

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.920
Like, I'm happy to live.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.680
We have the new silver pipes.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.880
Like, yeah, my bronze pipes.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.140
Fine.

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:37.700
I'm just gonna leave it.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.680
Well, that's Docker for Carltons, you know, so.

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.460
I use Docker loads.

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.520
All right, guys.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.320
Yeah.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.080
No, all the time.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:45.580
All the time.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:46.780
Let's just wrap it up really quick.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:47.780
There's a Django newsletter.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:48.680
I learned about that.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.280
That's interesting.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.760
You guys want to just mention that that exists?

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.040
Yeah.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:51.200
Yeah.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.160
So that's something I run with Jeff Triplett, who's a partner at RevSys.

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.700
He's a Python board member, very involved with Django.

01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.860
So Django-news.com.

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:01.640
There wasn't a regular Django newsletter.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.700
There wasn't a podcast.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:06.580
So he and I have been doing that for a little over a year and has projects, articles.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.780
I sort of wish someone else did it, so I didn't have to do it.

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:11.540
But we got a lot of people using it.

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.180
So that's a good resource for the community.

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:13.900
Yeah, fantastic.

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:14.540
All right.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:17.520
So before I let you two out of here, final two questions really quick.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.060
Will, I'll go with you first.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:23.420
Notable PyPI package out there that you were like, oh my gosh, I ran across this the other

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:23.680
day.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.360
I can't believe it.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.920
That's a good question.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.260
I'll go back to an old school one, which I think is Bleach, because I've been thinking

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:31.520
about a course on forms.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.840
And Bleach is a Python one, not Django-specific, but you pretty much always want to have that

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.220
added.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:41.800
So this validates user input to make sure there's no cross-site scripting type stuff?

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.120
Yeah.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.200
So that's top of mind.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.040
Not a new one, but I think along with white noise, you just got to use it.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:48.280
Yeah.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:48.760
Awesome.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.180
Carlton?

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:49.660
Yeah.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:49.940
No.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.560
Well, the one that's just really captured my imagination

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.760
recently is Rich, which is the-

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:55.280
Yeah, Rich is cool.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:01.340
the library for creating basically nice terminal output, nice console output, but it does

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:01.740
everything.

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.460
It even has like tables and all sorts of stuff.

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:04.680
Yeah.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:04.700
Yeah.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:05.340
It's really neat.

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:09.640
But like, it's got this inspect functionality where you can get an old, and you're sitting

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:12.020
there and you're in this shell and you're like, I want to see it.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.840
And you print it and you deer it and you look at the dict and it's all, it's not, and then

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:21.980
you go inspect, and Rich formats this thing where it's like, oh yeah, I can look here and

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.380
I can see exactly what's going on.

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.360
And it's just amazing.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.040
Rich is brilliant.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:25.640
And 20,000.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.300
That's what I love about coding, right?

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:31.120
I'd never heard of this before and it's clearly a very established thing.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.320
Well, I think it's last year.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.100
It's taken off quite, yeah, it's about a year old.

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:37.320
It's taken off quite steeply in its adoption.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:42.400
One that I ran across really recently, just throw it out there because it's a Django semi-related

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.600
one, is Disk Cache.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.560
Have you guys heard of that?

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:44.940
No.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:50.620
So it's a really interesting caching plugin that will, instead of using memory for caching,

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.800
it will store it onto local disk because you usually have way more hard drive space than

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.920
you have memory in the cloud.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.320
And it plugs into Django to like a stand in for the cache there.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.060
Okay, fine.

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:00.280
Yeah.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.060
I mean, I'm a big fan of file cache in general because like memory is expensive, right?

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:10.000
So memory cache is the best way and Redis and Memcache are good ways of doing that all

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:10.400
in memory.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:15.000
But then you think, I just want to generate some HTML once and then just pipe it off the

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:15.540
hard disk.

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:15.860
Exactly.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:19.680
To me, this is kind of the equivalent of SQLite versus a real database.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.400
It's like, you don't need Redis or Memcache or something like completely set up just like

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.380
until it gets beyond whatever.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.540
It looks pretty interesting.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:27.980
You do these packages things, by the way.

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:31.820
Like we include packages every week in Django News and there's also like an awesome Django

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:33.320
repo that Jeff and I do.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.340
You know, because the problem is you want some degree of curation, right?

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:37.140
Like something new.

01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:37.500
That's right.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.800
Like legit enough to be worth looking at.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.480
Yeah, absolutely.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:40.820
Thanks.

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.560
Yeah, that's very cool.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.620
All right.

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.440
And then final question.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.920
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.540
VS Code.

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.900
Same for both of us.

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:48.280
Yeah.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:48.900
Right, Carlton?

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.560
You're still in the other code?

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.840
Well, I have to.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.560
Yes.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.420
VS Code.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.040
Very nice.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:53.840
Use it a lot.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.560
Also, though, I still like BBEdit.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.180
Yeah, right on.

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:56.700
All right.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.180
Keeping it old school every now and then just for a little nostalgia.

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.280
I'll tell you what, right?

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:05.080
So I'm using VS Code and I'm like, but I need to do some transformations or I need to,

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.840
you know, do a multi-file search and a diff here.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.060
And VS Code's got all that stuff, but it's a bit, you know, this is built in JavaScript,

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.740
whereas BBEdit's a native Mac app and it's got a lot going.

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:14.440
Yeah, absolutely.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.380
I use PyCharm.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.400
Yeah, I'm a big fan.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:20.700
Local company here in Portland, Panic, came out with, what's it called?

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:21.100
Nova?

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.000
I think it's Nova.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.360
They just came out with a brand new editor.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:23.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:23.900
I want to give that a go.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.220
It looks pretty interesting as well, yeah.

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.140
It looks just beautiful.

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:27.780
Transmit.

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:28.860
I love Transmit.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.140
Yeah.

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:30.360
I use it all the time.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.080
All the time.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.120
For S3 stuff.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.080
We were talking about Nova, yeah.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:33.580
Fantastic.

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:33.800
Cool.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.200
All right, gentlemen.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.800
