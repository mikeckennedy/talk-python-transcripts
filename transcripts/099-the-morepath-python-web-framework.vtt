WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.580
One of the areas where Python truly shines is on the web.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.100
Many well-known websites like YouTube, Pinterest, and Spotify are powered by Python.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.100
In the mid-2000s, a number of powerful and popular web frameworks were created,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.840
such as Django, Flask, and Pyramid.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.020
It may feel like the choices of web frameworks and innovation in that space is basically baked and done.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.720
But we're actually seeing an explosion of new frameworks because of some new web paradigms.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.520
In this episode, you'll meet Martin Fassen, who created MorPath,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.060
a relatively new web framework built to be a first-class citizen of this JavaScript,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.440
client-side, heavy web paradigm that's popular in many apps today.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.460
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 99, recorded January 19th, 2017.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:14.000

Martin, welcome to Talk Python.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.720
Hello.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.160
I'm excited to have you here.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.760
I really love web development in Python.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.220
And I think web development in Python is actually one of the really early places that Python

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.960
became super relevant.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.200
And we've seen it spread to other places really well, like data science is the most recent of

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.500
these.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.940
But, you know, at the heart, I think a lot of Python developers are web developers.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.380
When people ask me, hey, what do you do?

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.800
And I don't want a long conversation.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.620
I just want a quick answer.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.420
Like, oh, I write web apps.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.940
I'm a developer.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.620
Something like this.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.760
So I love web apps.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.180
And I think it's really cool, even though there are many Python web apps around, that you've

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.760
created a new one relatively recently, within the last couple of years.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.220
So I'm excited to talk to everyone about MorePath.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.340
Before we do, though, let's hear your story.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.060
How did you get into Python and programming?

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.320
Well, programming I've been doing since I was a child, trying to create games in BASIC on

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.760
various computers, first at my father's office, because we had no computer at home, and then

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.520
later on, on home computers.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.680
What was that first computer?

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.820
The very first computer that I remember using, I think that's actually the very first computer

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.280
I used, was called a Triumph Adler, which is, I don't know what kind of brand that is.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:53.620
It was a CPM machine, and then after that, moved to early PCs, Olivetti M24s are the ones

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.840
I recall also being very early.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.540
And my home computer was an MSX2, which was C80-based and more popular in Japan and Europe

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.200
than the United States.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.560
Okay.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.680
And so you started out originally just poking around at these things, and did you try to

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.240
write some games?

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.260
Yes, yes.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.660
Like, I imagine many programmers tried to write some games, very simple things.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.540
I think it's interesting.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.200
Like, people really want to get into it and write games, and games are some of the hardest

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.440
types of software to write.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.060
Yeah, it used to be easier, I think, back then, because even mobile phone games are more complicated

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.300
than the games that were commercial back then.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.380
But even, there are a lot of sort of details, like real-time requirements and things like that,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.580
that you don't really have so much in other contexts.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.260
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.460
So where'd you go from there?

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.460
Are you planning on it at home?

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.640
Did you study computer science in university, or where?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.780
Yeah, I did something more artificial intelligence-oriented, but that's a very long time ago.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.180
But I had some courses, various languages, LISP, Prologue, taught myself C.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.580
I had a Pascal course.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.360
I did some work with Delphi for a while, back in the 90s.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.900
And then I was programming in C++, was writing this artificial life simulation.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.220
And then I heard about scripting languages, read an article in some magazine at some point

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.380
that listed Perl and Tickle and Python, maybe one or two others.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.760
And I basically just wanted to write some tools that could help me manage my C++ code base.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.100
And I looked at Perl, because that was sort of the obvious candidate at the time, and it was on my computer.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.780
And messed around with it for a while, and I could see how that would be a useful language.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.960
Like, it had made things like data types really easy.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.440
But it never quite clicked in my brain.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.880
Then I remember printing out the Python tutorial from python.org.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.260
And I read it one evening before sleeping, and the next day I was a Python programmer.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.200
That's awesome.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.060
I'm sure it's one day, right?

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.360
I've done this as well, but it's been very, very long that I printed.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.080
Like, I remember printing like 100 pages of source code in C++, trying to understand some application.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.800
And printed it and took it with me, because I was going away somewhere for the summer,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.040
and I didn't have a computer with me the whole summer.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.200
Like, the world has changed so much, right?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.960
Yes, yes.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.520
This was just without a computer for during the evening, but I just had printed out the tutorial.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.560
And yeah, then a few weeks later, I actually managed to get a job writing Python code in 1998,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.800
which was kind of...

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.900
That's awesome.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.680
...kind of surprised myself.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.360
But I was at a...

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.020
Well, it was actually the veterinary department of Dutch University in Utrecht,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.300
and they were looking for somebody who would clean up some script that had fallen apart

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.400
that was written in some combination of DOS batch files and D-based code.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.220
And they wanted me to rewrite it.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.900
And I said, can I use Python?

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.080
And they said, what's that?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.140
And I said, well, it's a programming language.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.940
And is it readable?

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.640
I said, yeah, yes.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.060
It's very readable.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.700
Which is really what they were looking for.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.900
And then I found myself having a job writing Python code, which then quickly sort of moved into the web as well.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.700
I started...

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:20.040
That was 98 as Zope was released as an open source product back in 98 as well.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.260
So I started playing around with that and then moved into web development from there.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.820
That's cool.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.240
Yeah.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.000
That first week or two of the job was just like, what am I doing here?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.360
I can't believe they just hired me.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.740
I just barely know this.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.220
Well, I mean, I guess I had just been playing with Python for like a few weeks, I guess.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.040
But it just clicked in my brain so much that I thought, okay, this is the right tool for the job.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.040
And it was sort of more or less a scripting job anyway.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.400
So that fit.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.640
And I remember I was reading like complex Python, the Python news group.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.980
And people were saying, oh, I wish I had a Python job and I'm stuck here programming in this other language.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.300
That it looks really unrealistic to get a real Python job.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.060
You know, back then those were very rare.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.740
And I was like, hey, I actually have a Python job.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.200
And I, you know, I didn't even particularly look for one.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.900
I just had one.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.800
So I was lucky.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.260
Yeah.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.600
Yeah, that's really lucky.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.260
I still hear that from people today that, you know, they're working in some other technology.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.960
But they play with Python at home and they're looking to get there.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.060
So that's really cool.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.620
Yeah, it's everywhere though now.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.840
I mean, Python, it's really a different world.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.800
I remember Python.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.240
I had to explain to everybody what Python was.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.860
I mean, even other software developers.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.500
And these days, I don't have to do that anymore.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.000
It's really everywhere.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.540
Yeah.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.420
There's some stats.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.420
Somebody that did a study recently analyzing active, non-trivial,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.000
GitHub repositories, which was something like they have 10K lines of code.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.020
No, 10K is worth of file content.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.540
And they've been updated within the last year.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.320
And if you take that in there, Python is the number two most popular language on GitHub

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.360
behind JavaScript, which I think is overcounted.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.960
So it's definitely a different world.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.420
Uh-huh.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.260
Yes, yes.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.600
And there's just lots of commercial projects that use Python in one another way that don't

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.160
even show up on GitHub as well.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.960
Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.940
So you talked about Zope and some of the, I think, you know, the successors a little

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.140
bit like Pyramid and whatnot.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:21.340
It seems to me like those were kind of inspirations in your new web project because you reference

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.800
them somewhat positively in your documentation and things like that.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.140
Sure.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:25.460
Yeah.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:31.520
No, I started with Zope in 98 and I was very involved with it until I think even, yeah,

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.420
about up to about 2010.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.740
I was even chairman of the Zope Foundation for a few years.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:45.820
And Zope was really, it was really a killer app for Python in a way because there are a lot

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.760
of the, as you mentioned, web development was an early thing for Python though.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.960
I think data science was there very early as well.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:59.780
But the conferences like the early EuroPythons and the International Python Conference that I

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.960
went to even before then, a lot of the people there were there because of Zope.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.180
That's how they were attracted to the conference and to Python.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.680
So it drew in a lot of people similarly to, I imagine, Django does now.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:20.860
Zope was a web framework before we even had a word for that because web framework only arose

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.060
as a concept later.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.840
So it was called a web application server, I believe.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.780
These frameworks were extracted out of like, let's build this web app.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.680
Oh, and actually there's some kind of framework we could almost use here, right?

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.420
In that sense.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.020
Zope was actually, yeah, it was a very strange beast.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:41.180
And in part it's because there were no, there was no normal beast out there at the time because

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.980
everybody was exploring.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.240
And in part it's because it was enormously creative.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:53.040
What it had was a web-based user interface, which doesn't sound very amazing now because

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.800
lots of things do.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.300
back then that's kind of unusual for web application development framework.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.300
And through that you would add templates.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.920
And later on you could add little pieces of Python code.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:11.260
And then it sort of slowly morphed into doing more and more sort of larger scale Python projects

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.160
using Zope's plugin architecture.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:19.180
And fairly quickly we were dissatisfied with Zope's plugin architecture.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.360
And then this whole Zope 3 project emerged,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:28.920
which was sort of intending to rewrite Zope and make it all better and create the future paradise.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.020
And while we created a lot of interesting technology and we learned a lot and actually built some real applications

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:42.300
with Zope 3, it never really took off because we sort of overshot in the other direction as you tend to get.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.840
Yeah, you rarely make one rash decision.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.920
It's usually swing back the other way, right?

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.300
Like it's just, I see that all the time in technology that people have some kind of monolithic thing

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.780
and they're like, oh, we're going to fix this.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.660
We're going to make it extensible.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.300
You can enable, disable, et cetera.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:56.700
Yes.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.440
And then it just becomes like, well, wait, this is no longer easy to use.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.620
I liked it because it was easy.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.560
And now it's like there's a hundred choices and it's hard to fix when it's broken and all that kind of stuff.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.840
Yeah, the early Zope was never really easy if you were going to build a larger Python-based project with it.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:16.960
But if you just wanted to write something quick, sort of using the web user interface, then yeah, it was very easy.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:23.740
And yeah, I actually spent time in making the Zope 3 technology available in Zope 2.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:32.360
So I created this little glue framework that I called 5, which is what inspired the Python name for 6.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.800
The name 5 was already taken.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.920
So they multiplied 2 and 3.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.940
Yeah, oh, that's cool.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.140
I didn't know you were behind that.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.360
Yeah.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.940
So I'm not behind 6, but 2 plus 3 was already taken.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.840
So they had to go to 6 instead of 5.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.040
Nice.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.500
Yeah, you already had the package name.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.640
So that's all that debate.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.300
That technology is still in use inside of the blown CMS to this very day.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:57.340
And then what I did in 2006 is actually started together with a bunch of other people.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.260
But sort of I kicked off that project.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:06.440
The Grok web framework, which was based on the Zope 3 technology, tried to put a friend of your face on it.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.860
Also inspired by sort of the new wave of web frameworks that had been coming then.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:12.820
Right.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:12.860
Right.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.660
That's like Flask and Django time.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.420
Yeah, Ruby.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.960
Flask was not around yet.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.900
But yeah, Ruby on Rails and Django were new at the time.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.120
So we tried to do something like that.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:31.300
So with Grok, we had some sort of moderate success because it sort of benefited also from the larger Zope community.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.440
People did start using it.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.760
And it was a lot easier to start a new web framework project back in 2006 than it is in 2013.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.880
Yeah, the expectations were way lower of what a web framework had to be, right?

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.120
It didn't have to be as polished.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.660
And the web itself was simpler, right?

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.260
I think the web itself was simpler.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:54.460
But I think the main thing that I think has changed a lot is documentation.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:13:01.620
Back then you could start a new web framework and have, you know, some documentation, but not really exhaustive documentation.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.500
Or very good documentation and still get some traction.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.420
And these days that's a lot harder, I think.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:15.300
The web was simpler, but the basics of Ajax, I remember I implemented those early on in Grok as well.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.760
So that hasn't changed all that much in some ways.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.780
But of course, client-side development was still very different.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.260
There wasn't as much of it going around back then.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.640
Yeah, it was much, much smaller scale.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.600
I mean, maybe jQuery was around then.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.620
I don't even remember the time.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.420
Maybe not.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.360
I think it was right.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:32.740
Yeah, I remember.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.620
I think I used MochiKit for a while.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.940
But yeah, I don't know where the jQuery is around then.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.180
But definitely not AngularJS and a lot of those types of things, right?

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.340
No, I did a framework there as well.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.420
I just keep creating stuff.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.860
You do create a lot of frameworks, I know.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.700
Yeah, because I can't help myself.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:57.720
So back in, I think, around 2010, it was just before all those client-side frameworks started emerging.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.880
I thought, oh, I have a great idea.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:07.600
I'll take my experience from server-side frameworks like templates and models and views and things like that.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:13.160
And I'll take some of those ideas and then see what happens when I use them on the client.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:27.340
So I created this JavaScript framework called OVL, which was based around jQuery, but allowed you to create views, view components for little bits of JSON that could identify themselves with a type.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.840
And then it would look up the appropriate view for it.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.980
And then you could just basically render a tree of client-side components driven by the server.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:41.540
And just around that time, Backbone emerged and then Angular and then all the others.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.160
And then I thought, okay, yeah, it was a good idea.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.220
But I just, because other people are having the same idea.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:54.580
And yeah, it was definitely an idea ripe for its time to take some of these server framework concepts and move them to the client.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.480
So OVL didn't get any traction.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.700
But I did learn a lot from creating it, which helped me.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.740
That's cool.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.240
It was absolutely the time.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:09.780
Yeah, it was definitely the time when there was many, a lot of evolution and creation around that kind of stuff.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:16.340
There still is, but a lot of, it was like every, every month you'd hear about something that's going to change the world.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:16.660
Yes.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.460
As you know, right.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.920
It's still changing quite rapidly.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.680
I, myself, I mean, people complain about JavaScript fatigue, but I kind of like it because I like the creativity around it.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.280
Yeah, and I can say I'm a client-side web framework hipster because I was doing that before it was cool.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.160
Definitely doing it before it was cool.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.860
Yes.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.320
Very interesting.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.360
So let's talk about your project, MorePath.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:44.360
One of the things, I watched a nice talk from you at EuroPython in 2014.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.520
I'll be sure to link to the video.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:55.360
And one of the things you started out talking about was why would one go and create a new web framework when Flask, Django, Pyramid, and lots more exist already?

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:55.840
Yes.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.200
Yes.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.080
And that's basically because I can't help myself.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.060
It's just a creative urge.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.880
I mean, of course, there are reasons why I created one.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:15.200
I had a customer at the time who wanted something that could do REST APIs really well and was small enough to plug into a larger application.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.380
So I could have used an existing framework for it.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:26.800
But I said, you know, what if I just take some ideas I already have and I had some pieces of code lying about and I just put them together and I'll create a little framework.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.200
And that's where MorePath came from.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.480
And it's still a relatively small framework.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.640
It hasn't grown that much.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:38.980
Yeah, you describe it as a micro framework and it seems certainly like it fits well in there.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.440
It seems like somewhere between Bottle and Flask, maybe.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:48.360
I cheat a little bit because MorePath, the core itself, is just a couple of thousand lines of code.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:57.100
It's built on top of this predicate dispatch library called reg, which I also created, which is just 500 lines of code, I think.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:08.580
But then I spun off another library from MorePath called Dectate, which is a configuration Python sort of decorator configuration library that MorePath then uses to implement its directives.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:13.400
And that's also some, I don't know, hundreds of lines of code as well.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.540
So, you know, you can still be micro if you depend on a few libraries that you're also maintaining.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.480
But nonetheless, it's still pretty small.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.980
I think it's about the size of Flask.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.080
So it depends a little bit on what you count.

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:33.640
If you count the template language implementation or you count the request response implementation, which is WebOp in case of MorePath.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.320
How do you add up these things?

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.260
How many lines of code is a micro framework?

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.920
But yes, it's small.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.360
Yes.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:46.840
Yeah, in my mind, micro framework is more about the exposed feature set and how much I have to learn to work with it.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:51.020
More than whether it's a thousand or two thousand lines or whatever.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:51.360
That's true.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.240
Yeah, that's true.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:59.000
And in that sense, I feel like your framework is something you can pick up pretty quickly and you can kind of understand a good portion of it.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.380
Yes.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:17:59.940
Yes.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.320
Pretty quickly.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.020
So let's talk about the goals first.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.480
Like what were the goals of this project?

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:11.600
So one of the things that I had been doing with Grok is I started using...

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.200
So I have to go back to ZOPE again.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:23.240
ZOPE and also Grok use this database called the ZDB, the ZOPE object database, which is a pretty nice object store for Python.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:31.080
You can just put in any almost arbitrary Python object, hook it up to another Python object just as an attribute.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:37.420
And as long as there's some path to a root object, then everything gets persisted automatically for you.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:45.220
That makes it really flexible because you can just basically store any kind of Python object to represent any model that you'd like.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.000
It sounds like a kind of early concept of what document databases became.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.660
Yeah.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.540
I mean, it's very tied to Python, which is both its strength and its weakness.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:59.320
Because, you know, if you change your class, then suddenly the instances need to be updated.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:08.440
But it used to be very hard to explain because when you said database, the late 90s, early 2000s, people just assumed you were talking about a relational database with SQL on it.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.820
And there was nothing really else that people were familiar with.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.520
And then no SQL happened, and then it became a lot easier to explain.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.660
It's like a hipster NoSQL database because there was NoSQL before there was NoSQL also.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.320
Yes.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.160
Yes.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:29.600
I mean, that makes some things very easy, but I needed to integrate a relational database with Grok.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:35.760
And one of the nice features about the ZOPE database is that you can vary.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.680
Well, okay, we have to go back to the ZOPE publisher.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.180
ZOPE has this sort of publisher that's based on traversal.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.120
So you just traverse a Python object.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:54.640
So if you have a path A slash B slash C to resolve that to an object and then call a method on that object to represent it as HTML or JSON or whatever,

00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:00.320
it would basically just do a lot of get that there and get item into the object tree.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:09.360
So you would just get attribute A from the root, and then you would get item B from the item that you just got.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:19.180
And then you ask for get item from that object, and then you get another object, and then you call it represent me as HTML method on it.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.860
So that's how ZOPE worked.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.120
So that's how ZOPE worked.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:28.360
And the nice feature of that is that it also allows you to construct URLs really well because you can retrace the path that you took.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:35.020
So if you have an object like a document and you want its URL, you just can construct it automatically.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.360
So I like that feature of object database and traversal.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:46.340
So then with Grok, I wanted to integrate a relational database, and I was using SQLAlchemy, but I wanted to retain that feature.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:55.700
And then first I sort of tried to coax SQLAlchemy to become a traversable tree.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.040
And while SQLAlchemy, it being very flexible, made that possible.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.500
It was not really very – it didn't really fit the models very well.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:09.720
And to have to adjust the models just so you can actually traverse to it with URL paths, this didn't really work very well.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.180
So then I had this idea, okay, I'll do it another way.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:20.520
I'll create a routing framework, but one with the property that you route not to a view but to the model, just like I was used to from the ZDB.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:30.580
And also I have the property that you can take instance of a class that is in the routing system and ask for a link to it.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.640
And then it will just construct it automatically from the routing information that it has.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.060
Right.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:39.040
So you could do something like if you had, say, like a customer, let's say.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:39.640
Uh-huh.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:45.200
Your routing URL might look like something like slash customers slash seven.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.880
Sure.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.120
It might know that, okay, well, that seven actually corresponds to the customer ID.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:22:00.160
And then you have attributes – you have decorators that will indicate, like, well, here's the function that you call to actually do that query and represent it however it's going to be represented.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:00.580
Yes.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.060
Yes.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.460
That's how it works in mobile path.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.540
In Crockett still had a slightly different sort of – there were no decorators.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.980
But otherwise, yeah, that's more or less the principle.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.680
So to resolve something, you first look up the model instance.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.080
You first do your query or you construct some kind of Python instance.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.940
You return this from a function that's connected to the route.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:29.280
And then after that, you look up a view function for it, and it can do this based on the class of what you just found and information in the request and things like that.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:37.000
So you can find this view function, and the view function gets the request and also the instance that you just returned from the path function.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.600
And then you do your rendering in there.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:45.740
And that has the nice property that you can link to any class that you exposed to that routing system.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.020
Do you, like, register documents or type entities?

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.760
Can you say these are the entities that you might be able to go to?

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.340
I register whatever models my views need.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.840
So in some cases, those are backed by a relational database like a customer.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:07.420
And in some cases, I need to create a model that represents, for instance, a collection, which is not really backed directly by a relational database.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.840
But you can implement it in terms of queries as well.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.140
And then you just attach views to that collection class.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.480
So, yeah, with Grok, I figured this out.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:26.580
And then with Moapath, I sort of took that idea and cleaned it up and made that sort of one of the central principles of the web framework.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:36.320
And I think sort of besides the easy linking, which was sort of the primary motivation, I think it also really helps structuring code.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:46.560
With other web frameworks, you often you see some kind of get this object from the database or if you can get it, do a 404 error kind of convenience function.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:53.200
And if you don't use that convenient function, you have to watch for, you know, a failure to find the object.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.120
And if you do so, you have to remember to raise a 404 error yourself.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.920
And with Moapath, because it has more knowledge about being able to find the model or not.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.000
It's not hidden inside of a view function like you would have in Flask or Django.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:06.540
Right.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:14.120
And if you screw that up in, let's say, Flask, you probably get like a none type does not have like whatever property you're looking for error, right?

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.380
Yeah.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.240
You'll get a 500.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:15.680
Yeah.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.900
You're getting a 500 error.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:23.020
That surfaces as, you know, cannot process requests, 500, which always gives people confidence in your application.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:23.420
Yes.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:23.860
Yes.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:24.140
Yeah.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:35.220
It turns out that if you have to write that boilerplate code anyway in your application, it almost doesn't cost anything anymore to just write a separate function to separate it into two stages.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.300
And you get other features from that as well.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:43.600
You can do permission checks also because you have an idea of the instance that is being represented.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.720
So you can say, okay, well, customers are only accessible.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.140
Views for customers are only accessible if you have a certain permission.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:58.040
And you can actually make sort of the concept of customer play a part in your authorization system as well.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:10.800
That sort of all these, because you constrain yourself to really route to a model instance first and then to a view you get from that constraint to framework and benefit and build on top of it.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.880

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.080
It helps support the show.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:28.180
Sounds to me like you focused very heavily on RESTful type of ideas, right?

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:35.180
Like the routing framework assumes that there's some kind of resource or model at the end,

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.940
and you can use like get to do default queries on it and things like that.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.200
Yeah.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:46.000
One of the sort of the basic ideas behind Moapath when I started developing it is to be good at doing REST.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:57.100
It turned out that actually, you know, a framework that's good at doing REST actually is also pretty good at doing traditional server-side web applications as well that do generate HTML.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.360
Those things are not in conflict with each other at all.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.240
But, yeah, the initial goal was to do REST well.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:12.220
And actually template language implementation took, I think, a year and a half or so until I finally got around to doing that.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:12.540
Okay.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:22.400
So some of the origins was almost to make this something that you can serve up almost static HTML with rich JavaScript that reaches back to the server for all sorts of data and whatnot.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.400
Yeah, because I had been developing, you know, even with OVL, I had been developing that way.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:33.860
So I had some ideas of what I wanted my framework to be able to do also from the client-side perspective.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:39.380
And one of the things that I sort of always have been is I tried to actually do real REST.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:49.720
These days, REST, the term has become so eroded that it basically just means, yeah, it means endpoints that the client just needs to know about.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.700
And it returns some kind of data format, but it doesn't involve linking or anything like that.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:28:14.140
So I always actually try to do and work with real REST where your JSON data structures also include links to other structures to sort of the other endpoints and that you can sort of enter your application with one root endpoint and then find sort of all the links and follow them.

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.740
And perhaps also embed objects if you want to get to me.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.080
To me, REST has become a synonym for HTTP-based services.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.700
Yes.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.900
Usually that return JSON.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:29.720
But I think the two things that are often neglected that you are hinting at is one is content-type negotiation.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.360
Uh-huh.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.540
And the other is the dynamic linking and discovery, right?

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.320
You request an original resource and it tells you like how you can continue to explore the service.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.900
MorePath has good support for content-type negotiation, right?

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.660
Well, actually, that's a thing I have cared less about.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:54.820
So it's actually, we do have a really powerful system which allows you to build that should you want to.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.640
But I haven't seen a lot of people actually try.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:05.940
So the idea that if you request HTML, you'll get HTML from the same URL as where you, if you request JSON, then you'll get JSON.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:11.420
Or perhaps you have multiple, even multiple versions of your API that are sort of negotiated that way.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.540
In practice, I haven't seen a lot myself yet.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.800
That doesn't mean very much.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.340
Sure.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:24.100
But you can go to like a view and say, you know, at app.json, at app.html and things like that, right?

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.000
Like theoretically.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.080
Yes.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:31.740
What you can do is you can name multiple views and then you can do, well, it's not negotiation,

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:37.360
but you can just say, okay, I want my different version of this or a different view entirely, actually.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:43.180
Because views are looked up by the class of the model, but also by the request method

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.540
and also by the name of the view, which is the last part of the path.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.620
If it's there, you can use an add sign.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.480
And you can also look up views if they have a body.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:30:02.180
You can actually look, interpret somehow the post body if it's JSON and then switch to a different view if you post something else.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.300
Just have it dispatched to a different function.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.180
And that whole system is extensible.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:12.460
So you could just write a new directive and add more criteria for your views in your own application.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:19.600
And it's actually possible to have, in the same runtime, to have one application that uses more criteria than another one.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.000
And they will just live next to each other because of more path configuration system.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.380
So you can add stuff that looks at the accept header.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.200
That's pretty easy to implement sort of in a basic case.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:36.180
But if you want to do full accept header support, it tends to get a little bit hairy because there's a lot of different possibilities there.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:42.540
I find, yeah, right, that's a very rarely used feature of services.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.860
Usually people say, go to this URL, do a get, and you're going to get JSON or something like that.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.060
Yeah, because the information is encoded in the URL, right?

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:51.960
You can just see it.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:57.220
And if you suddenly have to worry about, I mean, yeah, content types that you do the request with,

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:01.820
it becomes a lot harder to sort of get an idea in your head of what's going on.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:02.680
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:09.420
So one of the things that you talk about that I thought was cool, and you even had some nice hand-drawn pictures.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.140
Nice, yes.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.220
In your presentation, yeah.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:20.040
And one was like a web framework and embodied as a person pulling their dress shirt open,

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.580
and there's like a more path superman type suit underneath.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.140
You talk about the superpowers of more path.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.340
Do you want to touch on those a little?

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:28.920
Right.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:36.700
So some of them I've touched on already, but one of the superpowers, I would say, is the dispatch system.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:43.120
So the view dispatch system, but it's also used in other areas like this authorization system uses it, for instance,

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:53.800
allows you to write Python functions that dispatch on not just one argument like you have normally in Python with a method that dispatches on self.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.200
At least you can look at it that way.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:02.420
So the class of the self-argument of a method with the same name determines which actual method gets called.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:10.440
You can also dispatch on other arguments as well, and not just its class, but also other attributes of those arguments.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.720
And that allows the view system to dispatch on the class of the model.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:22.520
The request methods get boot post of the request, the view name, which is also stored on the request, the last part of the path.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:30.300
But also if the accept header or, you know, the type of the JSON body that you submit or whatever else you come up with.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:37.600
Yeah, I can tell linking is super important in this whole routing and linking is really a key part of what you're trying to focus on.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.220
Right.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.200
But yeah, this is the dispatch system.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:40.460
Okay.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.860
That's not the linking or the routing system.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:55.560
It allows you to write views that can be really general, work for, you know, any subclass of a particular base class, or be really specific for a specific class as well.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.180
And you can dispatch a lot of different factors.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.360
So that's the reg bit.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:32:59.680
Yeah.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.280
There's almost like an inheritance thing that you can do with that stuff, right?

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:03.680
Yes.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.720
You can kind of override a view in a specialized class.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.000
Okay.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.380
Gotcha.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:07.940
Yes.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:08.000
Yes.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:17.520
So it's like, basically, if you just look at the model bit of how you register views, it's very much like you define methods, but you don't define them inside of the class.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.040
You define them just as functions outside of the class.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.340
And your decorator says where they belong.

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:27.840
But basically, that's just one factor of what it does to look up with.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.060
And authorization also works that way.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:35.400
It's like, do I have this particular permission for this particular model instance?

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.500
And then it also knows about inheritance.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:42.820
So you can be very specific about, well, this subclass needs to have a different permission rule than everything else.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.820
And that's reg.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.820
Then there is the, well, the automatic link generation already talked about, which I think is really neat.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:52.080
Most frameworks don't really do it.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:57.360
I mean, they do it sort of halfway, where you say, okay, well, you need to give all your routes a name.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.980
You need to come up with a name and remember that and maintain that.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:08.280
And then when you want to generate a link from your Python code or your template or whatever, you need to use a special API or do this special thing.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:14.400
And then you need to give it all the variables that are needed to construct the link again.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:22.280
So you need to know still what those things are, whether that's the ID or whatever the link construction is based on.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:22.420
Yeah.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.360
And it usually appears in multiple places.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.360
There's usually some configuration thing where you define the route for the URL dispatch.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.700
And then there's the actual template where you put the thing.

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:36.980
And you have to know, okay, I have to replace, you know, these two parts of the URL with this part of data.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:44.000
And then in your actual view, you've got to pull that data out of the route data that was passed.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.740
And it's at least in three places.

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.380
So you have to do that.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:52.560
And if you have multiple places where you link to the same thing, you have to do it sort of in multiple places.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:35:00.040
And that also makes the code less generic because suddenly it's dependent on sort of the particular structure of what you're linking to.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.780
And if you were to change that, then you would have to change all the templates to link to it.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:04.220
Yeah.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.180
Everything breaks.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:15.440
And so what I do on my web apps is on my model, I will use like some kind of rich class and then convert it to a dictionary at sort of render time.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:22.340
But I'll put like a method like here's the function or the property that gets me the URL with all the pieces filled in.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.900
So I'll go in like template and say, you know, dot like purchase URL or whatever.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:27.700
Yeah, exactly.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:31.280
You kind of bake this concept directly into more path in a sense, right?

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.000
Yes, yes.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.580
So it's that concept.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:41.820
But then you don't have to burden your classes, your model classes with information about the web, which is basically, I mean, it's a reasonable compromise.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.680
I see Django.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.920
You can also do it with Django.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.460
There's a convention there as well.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:49.320
It's still, I mean, why would my model class know about URLs?

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:55.620
That's the whole point about routing framework is to not have to worry about that kind of stuff in the model classes.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.080
Exactly.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.940
You look at the standard MVC design pattern.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.340
There's, you know, an arrow from down to the model, but there's no arrows back from the model, right?

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.940
Which is like these basically what I'm proposing, right?

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.560
That it knows how to get back to these things.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:10.820
Yeah.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.660
And more path knows how to do that.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:18.160
But the information is stored outside of the model classes themselves.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:18.880
Nice.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.760
In the configuration system.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.840
But that allows generic code as well.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.280
If you, you know, make, have a list of objects and you just want to create a list of links to it.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.300
And those objects might be completely different places in your website.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:38.580
I mean, if you were to solve that with, well, you can solve it if you, again, burden your model with this get URL method, then you can do it.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:44.180
And without that, you would have to use a lot of special cases in your template or whatever to create the right link.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.280
So more path does that for you.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.080
It gets the information that it needs from the models.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:57.380
By default, just there's a convention that the name that you use in the route is the name of the attribute, but you can override that to reconstruct it.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.020
So that's really powerful.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.520
And then there's the configuration system.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:15.400
So more path has an actual sort of thought through configuration system as an entity by itself, which should not be that unusual for web frameworks, but it actually is.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:28.820
And what I mean with the configuration system is the system that lets you express things like, okay, well, this route exists and this view exists and I have this permission to access that view.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:37.280
Or I want to install a middleware that sits between the request and the handler and the response and sort of can interfere in there.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.360
Or I have a template rendering engine that I want to plug in.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.020
All those things I consider to be configuration.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:49.780
And that's really my SOAP history speaking, because in SOAP 3, that was one of the big innovations.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:59.400
We created this XML-based confirmation language called ZCML, where you would express all of this in XML files, which sounded really cool at the time.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.600
But one of the things that I did...

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.280
You just put this namespace here on this XML element that it'll...

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.080
Oh, yeah.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.400
Just kidding.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.100
Oh, yeah.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:12.360
Well, you know, you would just have an XML, a little XML language.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.980
That was namespaced, of course, where you would say, okay, well, this...

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.540
Well, you did have routes, but you would say, this view has this permission.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.780
And if you...

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.800
There were all kinds of things that could be configured.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.680
You would have adapters and things like that.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.440
But that's all pretty low-level stuff.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:33.060
But also services like, you know, the service that can send email is here.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:38.240
So if the application asks for it, just look at the configuration, basically, for the service that can send email.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:47.100
That kind of pattern you tend to see a lot in larger applications that need to be customized in different contexts, like a CMS, for instance.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:39:01.460
This portion of Talk Python is brought to you by Hired.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.480
Hired is the platform for top Python developer jobs.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.280
Create your profile and instantly get access to 3,500 companies who will work to compete with you.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.140
Take it from one of Hired's users who recently got a job and said,

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:17.440
I had my first offer on Thursday, after going live on Monday, and I ended up getting eight offers in total.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.900
I've worked with recruiters in the past, but they've always been pretty hit and miss.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.740
I tried LinkedIn, but I found Hired to be the best.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.840
I really liked knowing the salary up front.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.200
Privacy was also a huge seller for me.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.880
Sounds awesome, doesn't it?

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.880
Well, wait until you hear about the sign-in bonus.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.300
Everyone who accepts a job from Hired gets $1,000 sign-in bonus.

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.960
And as Talk Python listeners, it gets way sweeter.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:43.200
Use the link Hired.com slash Talk Python to me, and Hired will double the sign-in bonus to $2,000.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.000
Opportunity's knocking.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.760
Visit Hired.com slash Talk Python to me and answer the door.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:40:00.760
What I did with Grok is already tried to merge that back into Python, so you could express it.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:05.680
Well, we didn't really have class decorators at the time, and function decorators were very new,

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.160
so we did it in another way.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.160
But you can express it inside a Python code.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.760
And then with Morpath, I express it with decorators.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:18.580
And all those decorators are attached to classes, application classes, subclasses of the Morpath application,

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:23.340
that allows you to be classes you could inherit.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.980
So you can say if you want to inherit all the configuration of a particular base class,

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:33.500
and then override specific bits of configuration, like one view or added piece of middleware or whatever,

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.500
you could just do that with subclassing.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.880
And then you add your configuration to the subclass, and then your base class still has the original configuration.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.060
So if you were to run that by the WSGI server, it would still behave as it did originally.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:50.080
But your subclass has the new, if you instantiate that, you again get a Whiskey app,

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.000
and that will have the new behavior.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.260
And that's really powerful.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:41:01.020
And that was also powerful is that you can actually compose those little applications together into a larger one.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.980
So Morpath allows you to mount applications onto other applications,

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.040
which all could have their complete different configuration.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:13.640
It could even override some very basic behavior of Morpath and run in the same runtime.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.020
Sure.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:18.260
So give me some examples of what two or more applications might look like,

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.340
how do they work together, what's a practical story there?

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:25.420
Well, so for instance, if you wanted to develop something like a GitHub,

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:30.040
where you have projects, projects could have issue trackers.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.940
And you also have a wiki, perhaps, in a project.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:38.180
Now those issue trackers and wikis could be implemented as separate applications

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.620
that don't know anything about projects or each other.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.320
So you could configure them with their own routes and views and things like that.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.880
And then you can mount them together onto the project application,

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.140
should you want to use the wiki and the issue tracker there.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.500
But if you wanted to mount them somewhere else in a completely different project,

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.740
you wanted to use the wiki, you could mount it there.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:05.520
And in the mounting, the active mounting, you define sort of how to translate from the

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:10.260
sort of the outer applications set of concepts to the, for instance,

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.780
find the idea of the wiki app or whatever to find the wiki in the database.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.820
So they're really isolated from each other.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.280
But you could combine them with composition.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:23.220
And then, you know, if you have a customer that likes the wiki and it's all perfect,

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:27.080
but just wants to tweak this one little thing, you know, in their deployment,

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:31.640
then you could subclass the wiki and change it in that one little way.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.320
Hopefully, your wiki will let you do that.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.100
That's still up to the design of the application.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:41.080
But yeah, that kind of sort of feature is something that I was used to from Zope 3.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:46.360
And Pyramid is the other Python web framework that has this kind of capability,

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.180
though it does not have the mounting system.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.800
I don't believe Pyramid allows you to run multiple configurations in the same application.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.980
But I might be wrong.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:54.380
Sure.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.620
You might have to just merge it.

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:59.960
But at least it has this notion of configuration, override, extension, that kind of thing.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:06.040
And Moopart tries to let you do that while also being really simple to use.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:10.160
So you just, you know, you have application classes and you can subclass them.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:10.460
Sure.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.260
That's really cool.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.600
So instead of having one big monolithic app,

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.200
you could write a bunch of small apps and then sort of glue them together.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:17.760
Yes.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.180
Yes.

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:18.880
Okay.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.440
That's really, yeah, that's really cool.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.940
You have a couple of ways to get started.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.460
Like if I want to get started with Moopart, like what are the few steps?

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.040
You know, obviously pip install, Moopart, then what?

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:29.820
Well, there is a...

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:30.580
Do you scaffolding?

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:30.940
Yeah.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.740
We have a cookie cutter template out there now.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.760
It's in the documentation.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:41.780
So you could use that and then you get set up with a slightly bigger Moopart application.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:46.000
I've been resistant sort of to doing something like this for quite a while

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.340
because I find that if you do a lot of scaffolding,

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:53.160
it sort of becomes tempting to put a lot of,

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.260
sort of generate a lot of code basically when your project starts.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.120
And then I always think, okay, why is that not a library?

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.280
Why cannot, is that not configuration?

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:06.220
Why is there so much sort of stuff that gets generated just to get an application going?

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:06.540
Yeah.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.960
I think that, you know, Django sort of has that, right?

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.400
Yes.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:16.220
It's a sense that people think Django is huge, but you can actually create like a one file simple Django app.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.580
It's just nobody does it.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:18.620
So it feels larger.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.600
I think it's so...

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:19.740
Yeah.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:23.060
I think also Django is larger in other senses, but I believe...

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.440
No, yeah.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:27.920
It is larger, but it has its ORM and a template language and a lot of other things.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.200
You know, and I think Pyramid suffers from this as well in that it feels really big

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.100
because when you create it, there's so many pieces.

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:38.760
I don't necessarily mind that, but I think that's the message that it does send, right?

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.880
It's a different philosophy, I think, and both of them have their benefits.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:48.200
So Pyramid, I think, really tries to keep a lot of options open and to be sort of a little toolkit

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:55.360
that you can use in very different ways with a ZDB, with a relational database, with routing,

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.380
with traversal.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:01.480
Sort of it has all those different options and it tries to be pretty neutral about sort of

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.120
what the way that you pick is.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.200
And that's...

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.340
I mean, that's useful, but with Moopata, I try to be a little bit more opinionated.

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.780
I mean, it's still a micro framework.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:17.800
You can still do a lot of different things, but I do say, okay, there's routing and you

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:18.460
route the models.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.480
There's no traversal.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.240
There's no routing to views.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:26.540
You could plug it, the OPEC database is completely database agnostic, but it tries to be a bit

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:30.660
more opinionated about some bits in the hopes that that also makes it more approachable

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:35.200
so that basic application is not so much heavy lifting.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:35.920
Sure.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:39.800
Well, I think opinionated has been the success of Ruby on Rails.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.180
It's been the success of Django to some degree.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.560
So it's not necessarily bad.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.260
No, no.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:49.740
Opinionated is not bad, but it's sort of a tricky balance between being a micro framework

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.800
and being flexible, but still being opinionated.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.620
But, you know, if you're going to be a framework, you have to have some opinions because otherwise

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.160
there's no point at all, right?

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.920
You're a framework.

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.760
You're supposed to guide people in one direction or another.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.700
And Pyramid does have opinions.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.200
It has opinions about the configuration system, about these.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:15.800
It uses the SOAP component architecture to put things together, and those things are pretty

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.020
fundamental to its use.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:17.700
Yeah, absolutely.

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:22.600
So there's a place in MorePath where I can plug in some kind of middleware?

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.300
Like, what are the options for that?

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.480
Are there many things I can choose from and wire together?

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.700
There's a tween system, and I just took that term and the concept from Pyramid.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.620
I stole a lot of ideas from Pyramid and Chris McDonough because he went there first, right?

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.820
He was coming from SOAP, and then he thought, okay, I'm going to do it better.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:43.340
And then he was very successful doing that.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.560
And then I thought, okay, well, let's try as well, see where I end up.

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:49.600
So tell people about what tweens are in case they don't know.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.920
It's a slightly higher level abstraction of what a whiskey middleware is.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.620
A whiskey middleware is a little bit too low level because whiskey is very low level.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:04.880
But a tween is a function that takes a request object and calls some kind of handler, which

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:10.420
is your application or another tween that's sitting below, that returns a response object.

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.800
And because you have this function that you plug in, you can do stuff to the request just

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.020
before it goes into the handler, or you can do stuff to the response just before it comes

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:19.780
out of the handler.

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:26.140
And that allows you to do all kinds of neat stuff like commit transactions or do stuff

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.560
to the HTML that comes out of the system or whatever.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:28.960
Right.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:35.460
Like I think rollbar is a tween in Pyramid, and you can install it.

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:40.020
And anytime there's a 500 error, it'll capture all the details and send that off.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:44.700
And all you've got to do is like pyramid.include rollbar middleware name.

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.420
It's like pyramid.trib.rollbar or some variation of that name.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:48.880
Yeah.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.120
Django also has its own middleware system, which is very similar.

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.740
With Moabot, it plays sort of into the configuration system.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.900
Though, of course, only the outer application, mounted applications, they all share the same

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.140
middleware of the other application.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:07.820
But with inheritance, yeah, it allows you to basically make available a Moabot application

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:09.400
that has some middleware installed.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.340
And then if you subclass that, then that middleware is there as well for you.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.820
So you don't have to know very much to use middleware.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:22.560
And you can also configure a middleware to go on top of that or just under it.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:29.200
And then Moabot takes care of doing the sorting so that everything happens in the way you specified,

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.820
if it's possible at all, of course.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.280
Sure.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:31.840
Of course.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.160
Okay.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.120
Yeah, very nice.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.560
What kind of templates are supported?

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.740
Like, do you have Chameleon?

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:37.500
Do you have Jinja 2?

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.960
Yes, so Chameleon, Jinja 2, and Mako, I believe.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.300
Okay.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.340
Yeah, those seem to be...

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:43.660
Much plugins.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.640
They're not out of the box.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:50.320
You just need to install the template dependency, more.chameleon or more.Jinja2, etc.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.980
And then you just subclass from a base class that those packages expose.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.400
And then you have that template language available.

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:03.140
So then when you use that extension, those particular extensions, like .pt for Chameleon

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.800
and .Jinja2, I believe, for Jinja 2, then it will just render using that template

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.160
language.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.700
You could even use both in the same app if you wanted to.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:14.280
Yeah, and one of the other types that you have is just straight-up JSON, right?

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:16.380
You can just put it in decorator save.

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.080
This thing renders as JSON.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.480
It just converts directly.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.820
Yeah, then you just return a Python structure that can be serialized to JSON.

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:24.740
Okay, excellent.

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:28.000
What's the deployment story?

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:34.780
Like, this is just a straight-up WSGI application, so I can put it on micro WSGI backed by Nginx

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.520
or G Unicorn or whatever I want, right?

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.380
Yes, yes.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:42.640
If you take the application class and you instantiate it, then you get a WSGI application

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.660
and you could just hook it into whatever you like.

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:45.840
Okay, excellent.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:46.440
Excellent.

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.660
How about Python 3 versus Python 2?

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.960
What's the status of the various versions?

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.880
Well, we support both.

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:56.880
We have for some years now.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.560
For more path, that's fairly simple.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:05.280
For reg, there's a few very dark corners of Python that we have to be aware of.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.900
But yeah, both are supported.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:07.220
Okay.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.080
Yeah, excellent.

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.000
It's good to see lots of projects supporting Python 3 these days.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.300
Nice to hear that one does.

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.740
Yeah, it's easier for libraries than for applications.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:18.680
So if you have a test suite, that's pretty comprehensive.

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.000
It's pretty doable.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.460
Okay.

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:21.660
Excellent.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:25.700
So you're also involved in some other projects, and we're getting kind of the end of the show.

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:32.080
So maybe we just really quickly say what they are and then one or two sentences about it.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:36.700
I don't want to go deep on it, but just to let people know the other projects that you've worked on.

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:43.060
So we talked about Zope and Grok already and Ovil, more path.

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.960
But you've also done some stuff with LXML, right?

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.360
Yeah, I created LXML years ago.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.700
I've been messing around with XML and Python.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.800
XML was way cool back in 2000.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.440
I remember.

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:59.440
So I messed around with Python and XML, and I tried to write my own DOM implementation a few times

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:04.540
and created sort of a start of an XPath implementation at one point.

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:10.140
And it was all very interesting, and I learned a lot, but none of them sort of became anything very useful.

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:17.600
And then at one point, I had already worked with the LXML2 library, which is this really fast,

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:22.800
very featureful XML library and LXML2 on top of that, written in C.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:28.400
And they had Python minings, but they really sucked because it was like programming C in Python.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:34.940
So if you were to initialize something wrong, then you get a sec fault in Python.

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:40.100
And if you forget to freeze something, you would just get a memory leak in Python.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:43.680
And those things are not something you want from a Python library.

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:53.040
So I decided, okay, let's be minimally ambitious and build on top of this LXML2 library because it's really fast.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:52:00.700
And I tried to create a Pythonic API and also not invent a Pythonic API for XML because Fred DeKlant already had done that.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.260
He created element tree.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.100
And there wasn't any C element tree at the time, just element tree.

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:16.000
So what I did is, okay, let's create an element tree API with extensions for XSLT and XBot and all those things on top of a libxml2.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.420
So that's what I did.

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:27.120
That actually is quite tricky because of trying to do garbage collect C objects that can be in tree shape to each other.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:33.660
Things that, I mean, can be separate from each other, but maybe, you know, there's all kinds of sort of interesting details there.

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:38.380
And I used a technology called Pyrex at the time, but it's now been renamed to Cython.

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:43.340
So I was a very early adopter of Pyrex because I didn't want to write all that secret myself.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:47.640
And then one of the best things in my open source career sort of happened.

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:57.620
So I worked on Alex Melt for maybe a year or so, and I got sort of it working, and I was doing garbage collection, and there was an element tree API, and it was all working pretty nicely.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:09.200
And then this German guy, Stefan Benel, he started sending me lots and lots of patches and all kinds of enhancements and features and things like that.

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.460
And I basically, I was busy.

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:15.220
I couldn't really keep track of all the patches, and then I made the conscious decision at one point.

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:22.700
I remember it being the end of the year at one point, and I mailed him, and I said, you know, now you're co-maintainer of the project.

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:23.820
You can do whatever you like.

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:27.380
So I gave him that power and responsibility.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:34.180
And that was a very good move because he's been maintaining Alex Melt since then, which is like, I don't know, more than 10 years now.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.480
And added lots of features and improvements and things to it.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:45.600
And he also descended down the stack because he ran into Pyrex because I was using that, and he wanted to improve that as well.

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:57.180
And in the end, he and some sort of people from the data sciences angle, they forked Pyrex, and they basically created Cython because, you know, he was descending through that as well.

00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:05.720
And I sort of always wondered, like, if he keeps descending, you know, eventually he'd be doing microcode architecture for CPUs or whatever.

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.420
But he stopped there.

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:12.400
As far as I know, he's only doing Cython, but he's been a very capable maintainer.

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:22.620
So I always say that I put AlexML in the open source bank, and I'm getting interest on it because people have added features to it since then.

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.840
And I still use – I was using AlexML just this week in a project.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:32.440
It's still – I still run into it, and I just use it as a library now, but I did create it originally.

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:36.180
It's probably a good feeling, though, to run across other people's projects and go, oh, there it is.

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:36.420
Yeah.

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:37.600
It's a very good feeling.

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:46.700
It's also very useful to say to Potential, because I'm a freelancer, so it's very useful to tell Python people that you created AlexML because then, oh, yeah, we used that.

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:47.540
Most people know.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.400
Oh, prove to me that you actually know what you're doing.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.480
Yeah, that library you're using?

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:51.900
Yeah.

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:52.480
I read that already.

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:52.820
Yeah.

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.380
Oh, all right, then.

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.100
So that's pretty neat.

00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:01.500
Plus, yeah, I've been drawing interest on the – I mean, usually when you have an open source project, you don't really draw interest on it.

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.380
This is an exception.

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:13.140
Yeah, there have been features added to AlexML, like HTML parsing and all that stuff that I've used in the past that they were just pure interest payments on my initial investment.

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:13.880
Oh, absolutely.

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.200
Cool.

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:17.780
You also did something called Fantastic and Bower Static.

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:18.360
What are those two?

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:20.120
Yeah, FanStatic, actually.

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.220
Yeah, it's very hard to pronounce.

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:21.240
Oh, FanStatic.

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.240
Yeah, I got to read more carefully.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.100
Yeah, it's a joke.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.460
I mean, it's the plain words.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:34.140
But it's about – those projects came out of something I actually started with, hurry.resource, which was a SOP project.

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:46.420
So what I needed was sort of JavaScript files in my application, and those JavaScript files had dependencies, and there was no dependency system for JavaScript.

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:54.940
So I created one in Python, and a resource eventually got sort of renamed FanStatic and refactored into it.

00:55:54.940 --> 00:56:09.140
And the idea was to piggyback on Python's packaging infrastructure and Python's dependency infrastructure by just having modules where you declare that you have a JavaScript file or maybe a CSS file, other statistics resources, and how they depend on other ones.

00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:15.580
And then it can automatically generate include statements or generate rollups for you in a web page.

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:15.980
Okay.

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.760
Oh, very nice.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:26.280
And that's FanStatic, and it was sort of piggybacking, so you could release, like, jQuery as a Python package, and then you could just install it like that and start using it.

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:34.800
And it would be – you could use it as a whiskey middleware, so you would just insert FanStatic on top of your web framework.

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:46.860
And then inside of your view code, you would say, okay, I need this jQuery or whatever, or jQuery UI, and then it would figure out it would need jQuery as well, and then it would just include the right script text for you automatically.

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:49.500
By the middleware, we just automatically do that.

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:53.020
So that became an open source project a bunch of us worked on.

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:56.220
But, of course, JavaScript now does have a dependency system.

00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.300
It took a long time, but – and a packaging system.

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.080
So that became –

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.460
And Power is one of those, right?

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.800
Yeah, Power is one of those.

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:11.480
And, you know, when I started BowerStatic, it was basically, okay, I'll just whip up something that's based around Power because there's a packaging system already there.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:16.680
In some ways, BowerStatic is less powerful than FastStatic, but at least you can install a Power package.

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:22.560
You don't have to wrap all your JavaScript code inside of a Python package and then upload it to PyPy anymore.

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.720
You can just use the Power package database.

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.760
These days, you know, I use BowerLess and less as well.

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:37.300
I tend to just go for CommonJS packages on NPM and then use the tools that exist for that to package up my JavaScript code.

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.500
There are still use cases like BowerStatic can solve.

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:57.080
They're a little bit harder to solve with those tooling because you have a – if you have the use case that you have that's typical for enterprise software, where you have one core application that needs to be deployed in multiple places with particular extensions.

00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:04.820
And if those extensions are also JavaScript code, bundling everything up for one deployment is not good enough.

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:08.700
You would need to do something to bundle up things in pieces.

00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:16.240
And then if you want to ship them separately, it all becomes pretty hairy because the bundling tool needs to be run sort of at the very end.

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:31.040
So for use cases like that, something like FastStatic or PowerStatic can still work better if at least your native enterprise installation system is something like Python packages.

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.240
So that's a very specific use case.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.600
Those are both really nice touches.

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:35.620
All right.

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.660
So I think I'll have to leave it there for more, Pat.

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:42.280
We've definitely got into a lot of detail, but I know there's a lot more we could touch on.

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:46.220
All right, Martin, before I let you out of here, how about your favorite editor?

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:48.540
When you write some Python code, what do you open up?

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:49.440
I use Emacs.

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.960
I sometimes try out other editors and then I go back to Emacs.

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:56.540
I realize now what it is because I'm not really an Emacs power user.

00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:59.860
At least that's what I say, but I've been using Emacs so long that I...

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:00.340
Probably are.

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:03.000
...I, you know, learn more and more features over the years.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.940
But nonetheless, I wouldn't call myself an Emacs power user.

00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:11.800
But, you know, if you use it for 10 years and you learn a few features every year, you do know a bunch of features in the end.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:18.160
But the thing I really like about Emacs is that it just knows how my Python code is supposed to be indented.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.920
And if I press tab, it tends to do the right thing.

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.240
Also in other languages, it indents stuff.

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:31.060
And I'm so used to that that I tried Atom a while ago and it just didn't do indentation right for my tastes.

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.940
I could press tab, I could install an extension and edit.

00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:37.640
It would let me press tab, but then it would just indent stuff wrong.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.940
And then I went back to Emacs again.

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.000
So, yeah, we'll see.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:43.340
Yeah.

00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:43.920
All right.

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:44.140
Cool.

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:44.380
Yeah.

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:45.100
There's a lot of...

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.400
There's increasingly more options around the editors that are good, I think.

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:48.760
Yes.

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:49.180
That's cool.

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:49.360
Yes.

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:49.860
Yes.

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:51.200
And favorite PyPI package?

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.580
We've got 96,000, almost 97,000.

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:55.180
I have trouble deciding.

00:59:55.800 --> 01:00:00.560
I mean, I like AlexML, of course, because I mentioned already I'm drawing interest on that one.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.560
So maybe I'll just stick to that.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:02.920
All right.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:09.900
I use so many and there are so many very nice ones, but I just can't really think of anyone in particular that stands out.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:10.680
Sure.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.580
It's like, which one of your children do you love the most, huh?

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.500
Well, yeah, it's not even my own children.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:15.520
It's not even my own children.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.460
It's other people's children do I love the most.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:18.820
That's true.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:19.280
That's true.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.900
No, there are a lot of nice packages there.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:22.660
Let's see, whatever.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.100
I mean, I used Click recently.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:24.820
I like that.

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.640
Yeah, that is nice.

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:26.780
That's a nice little library.

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.740
What else have I used recently?

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:45.060
Well, I like, I've been messed around with numeric and pandas recently, but I was playing around with developing a data-driven game engine because, you know, why use numeric and panda for what they're really for?

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:49.200
So I was trying to blast data into OpenGL with Piglet.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.700
Piglet is also a very nice library.

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:51.200
See there?

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.140
I remember packages now.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:59.220
So I blast OpenGL data into Piglet coming out of, oh, sorry, NumPy.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.620
I mean, of course, not numeric.

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:06.500
So out of NumPy arrays, blast them into OpenGL to try to reduce overhead.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.120
Okay.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.540
That's a pretty interesting use case.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:08.780
Yeah.

01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:09.460
Yeah.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:09.880
All right.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.220
Awesome.

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.740
Well, very interesting answers.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.120
Okay.

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.020
So you got a final call for action.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.580
Like, how do people get started with MorePath?

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.480
Like, what can they do?

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.380
What do you need?

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.060
Do you need contributors?

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.840
What's on your radar that you'd love to have?

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.560
Well, contributors are always great.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:28.880
We have a few core contributors now, which I'm very happy about.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:42.660
And I noticed that if I do, like, one major outreach thing, like, when I spoke at EuroPython in 2014 for, like, hundreds of people, one guy started using MorePath and he became a core contributor.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:48.140
So that's just a few core contributors already, such a wealth in an open source project.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.280
So those things I like very much.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.280
We have a documentation website, morepath.read.docs.io.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.720
There's also a link to a Discord chat.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:04.480
So it just opens in your web browser and you can talk to MorePath developers and other people use MorePath.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.440
Create an issue on the issue tracker.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.060
That's also a way to reach us.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:13.920
And, yeah, I started thinking a little bit about, I was looking at Django a little bit recently.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:28.040
So I started a little bit about trying to create something like the Django admin UI, but then for MorePath using client-side technology somehow and perhaps using, I've never used it before, but I looked at the Pony ORM.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.940
And that looks like a nice ORM, so maybe I'll try that one day.

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.520
Yeah, Pony ORM is really nice.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:38.720
I had those guys on the show about 10 weeks ago, and it's really cool.

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:39.640
Yes, yeah.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.540
That's excellent.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.720
Everyone get out there and check out MorePath.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.720
And, Martin, thank you for being on the show.
