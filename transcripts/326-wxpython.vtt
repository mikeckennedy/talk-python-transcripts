00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.940
Did you know that I'm a fan of GUIs? You know, they're kind of like web pages,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.480
but they run on your computer, they have their own windows, and you can even use those applications

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.360
offline. On this episode, we'll dive into WXPython with Mike Driscoll. He's back on the podcast to

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.140
share his hard-won experience building and distributed Python window-based applications.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.060
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 326, recorded July 14th, 2021.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:44.480
Welcome to Talk Python to Me, a weekly podcast on Python, the language, the libraries, the ecosystem,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.020
At Talk Python Training, we hate subscriptions too. That's why our course bundle gives you full access

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.380
to the entire library of courses for one fair price. That's right. With the course bundle,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.880
you save 70% off the full price of our courses, and you own them all forever. That includes courses

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.440
published at the time of the purchase, as well as courses released within about a year of the bundle.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.440
Mike, welcome to Talk Python to Me.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.940
Yeah, thanks so much for having me again.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.640
Yeah, it's great to have you here. Maybe we can just remind people of the last time you are here.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.300
You wrote a really cool book called, I think it was Python Interviews. Do I have the title correct?

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.240
Yes, that's correct.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.960
Yeah, and that was back in episode 156, way back in 2018, three years ago, I guess, more than that.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.060
But it was a history book, so I was looking back, right? It's fine. It's still relevant. People can

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.600
check that out. And I really love some of the stories that you told on there. I love, I think it was Alex

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.160
Martelli. You interviewed him and talked about how Google Video and YouTube were sort of competing neck

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.740
and that was sort of a Python versus C++ story. That's probably the one that stuck with me the most.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.560
Yeah, I really enjoyed that one. Although there's some good stuff in the Brett Cannon interview as

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.820
well.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.280
Yeah, there's great stuff all over. I'm just trying to think of the one that I can remember years later,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.660
you know?

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.000
Yeah.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.580
Yeah. So it's been a couple years since you've been on the show. What have you been up to?

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.200
Well, since that book came out, I have been pretty prolific in my writing and continue to write

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.760
more Python books. For example, I've written one on WX Python and Report Lab. I redid Python 101,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.940
which was my first book.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.120
Report Lab is about like working with PDFs, right?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.980
Yes. You can use it to create PDFs. But that book also covers how to edit, or I shouldn't say edit,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.200
how to read and get data out of an existing PDF as well.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.260
Yeah. Cool. You got a couple of 101, 201 type of books as well.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.880
Yes.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.800
Like learning Python.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.760
Yep. Python 101 is for beginners and 201 is kind of intermediate advanced.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.900
So if I was like a sophomore, I might take that.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.260
Yes.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.420
Cool. So what are you doing these days? Are you doing the independent thing with your authoring

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.400
and creating? Are you doing consulting? What are you up to?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.460
Oh, I still do a full-time job. I write Python code that tests an embedded C++ application with Python.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.020
Oh, nice.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.260
It's really neat. But I also, you know, kind of as a hobby slash side job, I write for myself. I write

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.120
these books and I occasionally contribute to RealPython as well.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.460
A lot of good stuff going over RealPython. Dan and crew keeps that content flowing over there for sure.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.820
Yep.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:04:00.140
Yeah, absolutely. So we're going to talk about building GUIs or GUIs as some people say them. I don't know.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.840
Are you a GUI or are you a GUI sort of person?

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.000
I usually call it GUI.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.580
Yeah, me too. So we're going to talk about those for Python, which I think is interesting because there are,

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.560
there have been, there are decent options, but it's not a place where Python has traditionally received a ton of focus

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.460
and energy on building. A lot of these frameworks have to do with picking another framework that's a nice

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.760
cross-platform framework and like making it friendly for Python, right? I'm thinking of like PyQt or even WXPython, right?

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.020
Yeah, it's usually a C++ wrapper that preexisted Python and then it got wrapped with bindings of some sort.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.880
Yeah, exactly. A lot of these, especially the ones that do native widgets, those are really just wrappers

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:51.760
over the operating system when doing APIs, right? Like Win32 or what is it? Coco on macOS, those kinds of things,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.600
right? So it's like some thin layer than some adaption adapting thing for Python, right?

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.620
Yeah, I think there's only a handful that aren't wrapping something else. Like BeWares Toga,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.900
I don't believe is wrapping the native, I was trying to look, I guess it is wrapping in a way,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.960
but it's not wrapping a preexisting framework.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.720
Right, right. It's probably super low level. Like here is a, literally create a window that is a button

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.480
and that's it. Like not like Qt or something. Yeah, I think Toga is actually like, you know,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.620
trying to render the Coco widgets or the Win32 widgets itself, you know, rather than calling like

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.780
Qt or WX.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.220
Yeah, there's some value to that. There's some value to that. So I thought the place that we could start

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.420
is maybe a survey of these different libraries that we could use.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.740
Sure.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.940
Right. And so let's start with Tinker, TK Enter, which is really the Python interface to TCL,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.980
TK, right?

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.900
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.980
So this one comes built in, right? I'm here on the Python 396 documentation. And I guess this is the

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.660
official way to create QIs with Python, right? I mean, in the sense that it ships with it.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.440
It ships with it. However, on like Linux, the system Python does not come with it.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.860
Okay. So you still got it.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.440
And I believe, I believe Mac is the same way. You have to install it separately for its system Python

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.800
too.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.580
Yeah. That wouldn't surprise me. Well, you know, the system Python and Mac is all sorts of outdated and

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.020
whatnot, basically, right? Like 2.7, who knows what, right? But-

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.720
Yeah. But it always surprises me when I go to import TK Enter and it's like, oh, it's not there.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.300
Like, what the?

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.200
Yeah, exactly. Tell us about this one. Like, what's the good side? When would you use it? Or

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.980
would you use it? When wouldn't you use it?

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.700
I don't like it because it looks a little old-fashioned, but mainly because it draws all its

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:45.860
own ridges, just like some of the other GUI toolkits. So basically, when you create a TK Enter GUI,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.920
you know it's a TK Enter GUI because it doesn't look native. However, you can use a TK Enter,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.920
the code can be written without classes. You could write it completely functionally,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.760
and still make it work. So, you know, as a learning way to create a GUI, it might be a good first,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.880
you know, a good beginner or first GUI to create with.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.880
Yeah, absolutely. Here, I put up on the screenshot, the screen for us to see there's like this TK Enter hotel

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.980
management system. It definitely doesn't. I didn't see the top bar. I couldn't tell you what OS that's

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.900
from, but because it doesn't look like any OS that I know, right? Although there's another example. I'll

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:28.780
put these in the show notes. There's a pretty nice one that's hosting some kind of, it's like a predate

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:34.480
jupiter or something like host map plotlib exploration and stuff. And that looks like a

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.440
pretty solid app to me.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:41.740
Yeah. TK Enter did add a submodule called TTK, which does look a lot more native across platforms.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.120
You can make it look nice, actually, if you spend the time, but you're going to have trouble

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.380
finding good examples online because a lot of them just use the old interface. And one other thing I do

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.240
want to note about TK Enter is it's themable. So if you want it to look, you want to add themes to

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.520
your GUI, you want to take it as an option for that.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.980
Oh, interesting. It was like, so for example, you could give it a macOS like theme that turns

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:11.000
on on that platform and a Linux theme, maybe dark mode and a not dark mode.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.880
Yeah. I was thinking of dark modes, light modes, be giving them a certain color things,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.480
kind of like a Winamp type skin.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.440
Yeah. Oh man. Remember how crazy those skins would get? They'd get like 3D with little holes

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.200
cut in them. And yeah, that stuff got, that got a lot of little drawers, like an alien tongue

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.480
would shoot out. And that's where like the playlist would be. Don't do that people.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.720
Yeah. Don't do that.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:37.500
Okay. So for the most part, TK Enter is built in ish. At least it's sort of somewhat officially

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.340
part of Python, right?

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.040
Yes, it is.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:46.340
Another one, one that I think of a lot when I think of cross-platform stuff is Qt, Qt and PyQt.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:52.140
There's been a lot of different versions of PyQt. There's been a lot of stuff with licensing.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.140
So like right here on the homepage, it says licensing. PyQt is dual license on all the

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:03.800
platforms under DPL3 and the Riverbank commercial one. Unlike Qt, PyQt is not available under LGPL,

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.720
which is, I guess what you would need for like a commercial closed source app. And then there's,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.880
there's another wrapper around Qt that I think is LGPL. Like the, there's a lot of stuff that's

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.320
just like, whoa, why is it so complicated?

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.940
Yeah. PyQt is kind of confusing when it comes to its licensing structure.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.020
Yeah. Which is crazy because I've had this conversation multiple times and it seems like it,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:31.240
I don't know, it either, it never resolves clearly in my mind or it's just challenging. But that said,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:37.080
there's really nice apps built with Qt. So for example, like one of the database tools I use for

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:44.260
working with MongoDB is Robo3T. And if you look at Robo3T, this thing is glorious in terms of its sort

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.280
of native look and feel. Like if you go to the robomongo.org, scroll down for the screenshots,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.340
there's the three OSs side by side and every one of them looks like it belongs on that platform,

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:55.600
right?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.600
Yeah. You can get a little bit simpler with, instead of using PyQt, you could use Qt for Python,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.300
which is the new name for PySide.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:02.500
That's right.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.200
That's right.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.900
And it has a bit more permissive licensing structure.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.760
That's the one I was thinking of. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. They renamed that to Qt for Python,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.120
right?

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.820
I believe so. Although the import is still PySide.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.360
Is it still PySide? How interesting.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.700
It's like PySide 6, I think. Yes.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:23.860
Yeah. How interesting. So this, I think Qt's a pretty solid option. I feel like I see Qt being

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.940
used in embedded systems and other types of things. Like I said, I started using RoboMongo just because

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.540
it seemed like a good app and like, oh, this is a Qt app. It's not a Python. It's a C++ app,

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.220
but it just as well could be. Like there's nothing fancy about it that it makes it have

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.380
to be C++. It just happens to have been that way. Yeah. Yeah. So what are your thoughts on

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:49.620
this as one of the options? Oh, Qt is really powerful. You can do a ton. And while it draws

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.640
all of its own widgets itself, it's not actually using the native widgets. It looks native.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.720
At least they made an effort. Yeah. Yeah. Again, this one is also a themable. If you want to do themes,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.260
you can change, you know, dark mode, light mode easily because that's all drawn itself.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:12.900
I think PyQt and PyQt for Python both support QML, which is kind of an XML version of the C++ library.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.100
So you can kind of write it, write your GUIs in a markup language.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.740
Yeah, that's right. It's a little bit like XML or XAML from the Microsoft space. Yeah, that's right.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.780
It also has a, what you see is what you get editor. I think it's Qt Designer.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:33.180
It works for both C++ and Python. I believe the Python side, you have to do some special imports

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.020
to actually use the UI file it generates. Yeah. That seems like a really valuable thing to me

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.940
to visually be able to say, I want this widget to be here. I want this one to stretch like that and so

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:49.900
on. Yeah. I work with a bunch of C++ cute guys and they use the designer, but occasionally it will do

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:55.080
crazy things when your design gets really complex, where it's really hard to get stuff to stretch the

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.140
way you want it to. And sometimes you just have to drop into the code to make it work right.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:04.260
Yeah. Well, I think that's probably the case with many of the frameworks, right? Not just these Python

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.280
ones we're highlighting, but you know, Xcode, whatever, right?

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:13.660
I think that's just a problem with auto-generated UI code. Whenever you use a designer like that or

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.140
Visual Studio, you're going to run into quirks.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:23.940
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Next up on our list here is Kivy. Kivy, I heard about a lot from sort of

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:29.420
building mobile apps with Python in interesting ways. It's kind of got this game, draw your own UI

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.340
sort of feel to it.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:37.940
Yeah. It's also cross-platform. It runs on mobile too, though. So you can deploy its apps to Android and

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.680
Apple OS. But yeah, a lot of the stuff on there... Well, I should back up. It was originally developed

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.360
for multi-touch. So like Microsoft's original Surface table, I think is what it was originally developed

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.000
for. Yeah.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.400
But, you know, obviously it also works great on multi-touch phones and whatnot. But yeah, all of its widgets are

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.960
drawn by Kivy itself. So they look like a Kivy app most of the time.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:07.420
Yeah. They have a gallery over here. And in the gallery, they even have like some surface table

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:12.160
exploration stuff, like the city of Marseille map exploration type thing, right?

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.600
They have a Kivy garden, I believe, that also showcases lots of custom widgets.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:23.000
Yeah. So when I look at the... I'm scrolling through the gallery here, I feel like there's a lot of 2D

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.600
sort of interactive things, a lot of games or stuff like that, right? So it's... If I wanted to build an

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:36.820
app that maybe looked like it used the Windows rich text box and the Windows button, so it looked like

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:42.000
a, I don't know, a Windows 10 button on Windows 10 and a Windows 11 button with curved edges.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.140
It's not that kind of framework, right?

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.160
No, it's not.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:45.780
Okay.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:52.120
And I believe Kivy is based on, or written on top of Pygame. So it has... That's why I can do games so well.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.680
Right. That sounds familiar to me as well. And apparently the winner of the Python Discord

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.080
Code Jam 6 was done in Kivy. So that's pretty cool.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.000
That is cool.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.100
As well as second place.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.600
So I was unaware.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.200
Is there a third place one down here?

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.640
Yeah, it is.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.080
Wow.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.260
They have a clean sweep of the podium with Kivy. So that's pretty impressive, actually.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.460
Yeah. I've actually played one of their games on my phone before and they seem pretty well

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:16.760
done.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.160
Nice.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:23.940
Another one that's gotten a lot of traction and has its own opinions for how it works is

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:29.160
PySimple GUI. I think Mike Barnett, if I'm remembering correctly, is working on that.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.400
Yeah.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:35.320
And yeah, the idea is to make it super simple to just get a basic UI up and running, right?

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:35.700
Yeah.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:43.200
So PySimple GUI wraps, I think, four or five other frameworks. So it wraps tkenter, WX Python,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:50.520
PyCute, Remy, which is a mobile thing, and something else. And basically it gives you the same API for

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.960
all of them. So that, you know, if you write your code once and then you just change the import from

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:02.380
import PySimple GUI to import PySimple GUI Qt or PySimple GUI WX, you can get that native look and feel

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.500
because you're using WX acute.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:10.200
Oh, that's a really cool aspect, right? That you can swap out the widget engine or something,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:10.720
basically.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.240
Mm-hmm. Yeah. The default is tkenter.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:18.240
Yeah. Probably because it's the least dependencies and you don't have to think about which kind of

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.520
license you're doing what with.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.320
Yes.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.240
Interesting. Okay. So this is a pretty cool one. If you're just trying to get a dialogue up that

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.700
has one or two buttons and an input and a progress bar, maybe this is a good option.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.420
They can do quite a bit of complex GUIs too. There's a demo package that they have that

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:42.600
shows how to integrate it with matplotlib and opencv and lots of other things. These examples

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.660
don't show the advanced stuff it can do.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:50.500
Right. I'm just sort of paging through the gallery, the screenshot they have on the site

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.360
there, which we'll link to.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.100
And again, since it's using tkenter, it also does themes natively.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.740
Yeah, it can just float.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.200
At least for the tkenter part.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:57.980
Yeah, exactly.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:11.420
This portion of Talk Python to me is sponsored by Linode. Visit talkpython.fm/Linode to see why Linode has been voted the top infrastructure as a service provider by both G2 and TrustRadius.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:24.160
From their award-winning support, which is offered 24-7, 365 to every level of user, to the ease of use and setup, it's clear why developers have been trusting Linode for projects both big and small since 2003.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:34.080
Deploy your entire application stack with Linode's one-click app marketplace, or build it all from scratch and manage everything yourself with supported centralized tools like Terraform.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:44.700
Linode offers the best price-to-performance value for all compute instances, including GPUs as well as block storage, Kubernetes, and their upcoming bare metal release.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:52.460

And thank them for supporting Talk Python.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:20.360
One that you put in the list that I haven't really done anything with is DearPyGUI, a fast and powerful graphical user interface toolkit for Python with minimal dependencies.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.480
Tell us about this one.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:30.240
This one I haven't played with very much yet, but I believe the guy who created it has been working a lot on it lately, and it has a really neat interface.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.700
I don't think it's wrapping anything, but I could be mistaken.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:42.600
It looks very focused on providing animated and interactive aspects for scientific visualization and exploration.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.140
Yeah, I think it is.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:49.080
I don't believe it tries to look native necessarily either, but it has a very slick interface.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.440
Yeah.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.220
Yeah, it does.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.400
There's a lot of cool stuff that's going on here.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.040
Okay.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.880
So that's a neat one.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:02.460
And I guess one that I didn't properly cover yet, because I didn't pull up in our little list here, but it's a toga from Beware.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.920
You touched on that, right?

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.160
Yeah.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.440
So all this stuff over at Beware is super neat.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.940
There's a lot of nice things going on.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:16.640
It definitely, the native widgets feels, and I just always feel kind of like, ah, this thing doesn't really belong here, right?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:25.460
When I see an app, it just looks like you're like, this is, you know, some clearly cross-platform, not really this platform feel, right?

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.040
Yes.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.520
I don't know.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:32.960
I appreciate the native widgets aspects, but it's also listed in sort of the maturity level as early development, right?

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.460
So I'm not sure if this is pretty for you to pick up and build with yet.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.420
Yeah, not really is my understanding.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.380
And oddly enough, it's been in early development for like the last five years.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:42.700
Yeah.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.340
So it's been really slow to develop.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.180
They're trying to do it from the ground up and they're not wrapping anything.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.500
It's somewhat understandable, but I think they recently added Android support.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:58.740
So I think that they're focusing more on the mobile stuff than, you know, like Windows and Macs, native OSs.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.000
Yeah.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.120
The last commit was a merged PR from Russell Keith McGee four days ago.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.760
So there's still, still action.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.300
Yeah.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:06.820
Yeah.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.760
They're still working on it.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.420
All right.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:14.100
Well, that brings us over to the WX Python, which is another one of these options in this space,

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.180
but that's what we're going to focus on in this particular episode, right?

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:18.520
Sure.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:18.840
Yep.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.760
So give us the quick overview of WX Python sort of compared to these other options we've been covering.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.600
So WX Python is again, a C++ project.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.360
It wraps WX widgets or Wix widgets, I've heard it called.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.540
It works on Windows, Mac and Linux and Raspberry Pi.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:41.220
The big thing about DAPX Python is that it does do native widgets wherever possible on all platforms.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:41.880
Yeah, that's cool.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.180
So that is really cool.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:48.800
It also provides a lot of custom widgets in case you need them for certain purposes.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.400
Like some, I believe, I think it was Mac that didn't have a toggle widget for a long time.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.120
So they provided their own toggle widget for it.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:56.340
Right.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.880
It's the GUI equivalent of a polyfill.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.520
It's like that feature is not supported, but you want it.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.120
Well, like, all right, here's that something that'll do for now.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:04.920
Yeah.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.280
Yeah.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:05.960
Very cool.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.100
You know, it looks to me like it checks a lot of the right boxes.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.240
What's the licensing story?

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.640
It's very permissive.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:12.920
Yeah.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.540
I'll pull up there.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.100
I'll pull up the repo and hit their license doc and see what I can find.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.040
I know they called it the WX Python license, but I'm trying to remember.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.580
Ah, that's right.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.060
It looks LGPL-ish.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:24.520
Yeah.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.400
I think it is mostly LGPL.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:26.960
Mm-hmm.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.480
Yeah.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:27.760
Cool.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.100
That's better than multi-license confusing.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.400
Like the C layer has one license and the Python layer has another license, but then there's

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.680
this other commercial license.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.580
So it seems like it's pretty easy for you to just decide to adopt it and use it on your

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:41.900
project.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.200
Yeah.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.480
I would agree with that.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.900
And it's also extremely stable.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.000
They almost never break your code when they release a new version.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.420
Okay.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.160
That's cool.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.960
I heard that it rose from the ashes.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.700
Yeah.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.140
The Phoenix release and then the legacy or traditional version.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.160
What's the story of that?

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.680
So, you know, Python 3 came out and a lot of people, you know, fussed about supporting it.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:13.320
It was a pretty big deal to port WX Python to Python 3 because WX Python has a really small

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.640
group of core developers.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.840
But eventually he created, or Robin Dunn is the main guy behind WX Python currently.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.160
And he decided, well, we're going to call it Project Phoenix while I get this working.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:29.920
And I think he actually switched the way he binded to Wix widgets at the time because he

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.860
went from like SWIG to, I believe, SIP, which is a different type of binding.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:34.240
Okay.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.620
And that made it a lot easier to support both Python 2.7.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.940
And I think it was 3.4 was the first release for Wix Python.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.420
And that also made it pip installable.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.680
So that was super awesome when he got that working.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.800
So if I want to use it, I can just pip install DevX Python or Wix Python.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.500
As I'm learning that I might want to say it that way.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.740
Yes, that's correct.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:59.920
And there's a caveat on Linux that sometimes you need to have a couple of extra Linux dependencies

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.560
installed.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.300
But other than that, pip install should work.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:03.620
Yeah.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.120
Well, that's pretty standard, right?

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.980
If you're doing GUI stuff on Linux, a lot of times there's elements there you got to add.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.260
It doesn't seem outrageous.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:11.740
No.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.060
Yeah.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:17.500
So another thing that I'm a big fan of to the extent that they work, and the better that

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.360
it works, the more I'm a fan of it, is the GUI designer.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.380
So there's two over here, right?

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.200
We've got like this Wix form builder in the Wix Glade.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.700
I think I tried the Wix form builder and it just, it kept crashing.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.800
Not like it would start and was unstable.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.860
It would not start for me.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:40.400
And I don't know what the deal, maybe it was the version of macOS I was running on or something.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.520
But what's the story?

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.540
Are these things that people would use?

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.020
Yeah.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.000
What's the story around the WYSIWYG side of these?

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.300
WX Python traditionally hasn't had really a WYSIWYG editor, but people have tried to build

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:53.560
them.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.980
So I think Wix Glade is probably the one that's been around the longest.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.420
Okay.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.140
And probably the best supported.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.580
I don't think it, I think it supports the core widgets of WX Python.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.280
If you were to pull up the WX Python demo app, there are like a hundred, I would say at least

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.160
a hundred widgets, maybe more, maybe 200.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.400
So the core widgets, you know, like buttons.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.820
Do I find that under widgets?

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.880
You would find that under, let me see, downloads.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.540
Downloads.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:19.900
There you go.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.560
Unfortunately, it's actually something you run.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.540
Yeah, sure, sure.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.200
So if you can download, I think I have run that before and you basically, it's like got all

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.380
these windows that'll show you little use cases for this widget or that widget, right?

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:31.640
Yeah.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.900
It also shows you the code and you can edit the code live in the demo and see how it, how

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.300
it changes the widgets.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:37.920
Oh, that's neat.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.340
It does a decent enough job.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.580
I think it outputs a Python file.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.540
So that's nice.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.940
I mean, it doesn't put, you know, like Qt's designer output's a UI file that you have to

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.940
figure out how to import and then use.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.060
This one actually outputs a Python file.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:51.720
Oh, that's nice.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.660
Yeah, that's really good.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:58.760
So I'm looking at the screen here and it looks like Audacity, the well-known audio editing

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.580
app is built in DubX.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.260
I'm guessing.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.860
Otherwise, there's no reason they would feature it.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.140
I believe that's true.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.660
I'm not sure if it's Wix widgets itself.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.920
Yeah, it's on the Wix widgets site.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.560
So I'm pretty sure it's a C sort of thing.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.800
But yeah, these are pretty good looking apps that you can like sort of page through all their

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.480
screenshots on just Wix widgets.org.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.620
Almost even like an auto trader looking thing and like a diff tool.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.740
Yeah, file merge.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:24.660
Yeah, Audacity.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.080
Yeah, I believe one of the Linux diff tools is written with WX Python.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.960
And I had heard that the Dropbox UI was written with WX for a while.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.360
I don't know if it still is or not.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:35.660
Cool.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:41.680
So it seems like there's quite a rich library for working with these things with WX Python

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.220
or Wix Python.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:48.200
And I guess maybe one of the nice ways to explore this would be, where am I going to

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:48.380
go?

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.320
I'm going to go over here a little bit.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.340
To talk about sort of some of the things you covered in a recent book that you wrote.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.020
Not super recent, but somewhat recent.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.760
Creating GUI applications with Wix Python, which is pretty cool.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.500
And a comment from the live stream out there.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.420
Juergen says, congrats on the successful fundraiser for your latest book, which is not this book,

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.380
but like...

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:08.620
No.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.640
What book is that that you're just working on now?

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:16.400
I'm working on one that talks about automating Excel with Python using OpenPy Excel.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.320
Well, that's certainly a hot topic indeed.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.820
What's the story with this creating GUI apps with Wix Python in your book?

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:29.560
Feels like from the extent that I got to read it, which is not all of it, but some of it.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.900
It does a quick introduction of how to work with the widgets and stuff and get some stuff

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.340
on the screen, understand the layout a little bit.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.240
And then it goes through and just builds like a bunch of different apps, like a nice little

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.720
image viewer, a database viewer tool that uses SQLAlchemy to like explore stuff there,

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.560
a calculator, an archiver, MP3 tag editor, those types of things.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.740
You want to maybe just tell us like kind of some of the key elements before we actually,

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:01.720
before we get into those, let's just maybe, it's hard in code, but on audio to talk about

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:07.120
code, but maybe just give us like a sense of what is it like to get a window and a button

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.660
on the screen or something like that?

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.220
Sure.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:15.900
So, you know, Linux Python, much like PyQt, they're all class-based.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:21.100
So, you're going to be inheriting from different classes to create all the widgets online.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.260
Whereas with Tcancher, you don't have to do that.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:23.520
I see.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.480
So, you might make like a window class and like a layout main section class or something like

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:29.700
that?

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.460
Kind of.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.180
Okay.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:36.360
Layouts usually aren't needed to be subclassed, but like you subclass a frame, which is the main

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:36.740
window.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:45.060
You can subclass a panel, which is kind of like the tabs on your Firefox or Chromebook.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:50.400
You can create a notebook object that has multiple panels when each of those panels is a tab,

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.220
basically.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:51.580
I see.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.340
So, it has like a multi-doc version or style that it'll support.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:55.680
Correct.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.040
Yeah.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:56.320
Okay.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:56.640
Cool.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.940
And within your frame, you have your panel.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.500
And then within the panel, you have your widgets.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.140
And so, those are your children widgets.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:08.000
Like you have your buttons or your, you know, your scroll bar or your check boxes or whatever.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.360
The code can get kind of unruly, but for just creating something really simple, you can do

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.360
it in less than a hundred lines of code most of the time.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:22.220
But, you know, once you start doing like anything complex with WX Python, you're going to start

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.240
adding a lot of code.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:23.600
Right.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.260
Because if you're going to have, say, three buttons and a text field and you want to,

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.860
you want to figure out how they lay out, there's like a couple of things that you're going to put

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.260
just on the layout side.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.460
And then you're going to have to hook potentially the events.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.520
You can abstract that away a little bit.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.580
So, it's not too bad.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:42.760
Like if all the buttons do something similar, then you can make that really short.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.620
But yeah, if you, if all the buttons do something completely different, then you could, you know,

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.200
you have three different functions.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.040
The way I have written wrappers to make laying that stuff out simpler.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.180
So, I don't have to repeat the same boilerplate.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:55.540
Yeah.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.120
All the time.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:56.440
Yeah.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.220
As soon as you're like, why is this so complicated?

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.380
Why do I keep doing this?

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.340
Maybe that's the time to think about how do I do it just one more time with a little more

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:04.980
polish and then never again.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:05.720
Yeah.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.020
Yeah.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.560
So, the widgets have events, right?

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:16.180
Like on a Windows, it'd be like a WM key down, like win32 event that is then translated to

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.540
the Wix event, which then calls back into, say, Python, right?

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.080
And what you do is you give it just either a class level or just a regular function.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.280
Whenever somebody clicks this button, call this function, right?

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:28.800
Yes.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:34.960
It's usually like for buttons, it's like WX.event button, and then you just bind it to a function.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.360
Right.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.760
Or you could bind it to the entire app if you wanted to, so it captures the clicks.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.160
Yeah.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:40.160
Yeah.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:45.900
What I thought was interesting looking through the framework was in many UI framework, like

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:53.420
native compiled built-in frameworks, they don't, basically the button gets a click or it doesn't,

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.000
or somebody clicks the thing outside of it or it doesn't.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:00.400
But in JavaScript, we have like bubbling events that go up and down.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:09.440
So, if I click on a label, but the label doesn't handle it, like, but somewhere higher up, maybe it's in a div and the div is handling the event, like that would catch it, right?

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:14.220
So, you have this ability to say, go up until it's the right level to deal with this action.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.820
And it looks like WX Python has that as well.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.600
Yes, it does.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:17.900
Yeah.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:17.960
Yeah.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:25.820
That was a little surprising that you can sort of bind the same event at different levels and then either capture it or let it keep flowing up.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.040
So, they both get hit, I guess.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.300
Yeah.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.800
You can do that and you can, you know, execute your event and then you can say, I think it's event.skip.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.040
Yeah.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.320
And it'll go to the next level.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:33.620
Right.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.540
That's like, don't let me consume the event.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.340
Let it keep going.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:36.800
Mm-hmm.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.020
Bubble it up or something.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:38.320
Yeah.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:38.640
Yeah.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.420
Really nice.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:51.980
So, one thing that you talked about that I thought was interesting before we get into maybe a little more detail is you talked about, it's really nice to have a conception of what your app is going to look like, especially around layout, right?

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:52.460
Mm-hmm.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:52.880
Yes.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.160
So, you recommended, well, one is just like writing stuff out on paper, which is always good.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.940
We also recommended using Balsamic as something where you could potentially sketch out the UI.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:04.320
Yeah.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.860
I really like Balsamic because it just makes, it makes laying stuff out kind of a breeze.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.900
You could also, you know, you could use that cute designer because it's free and open source.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.440
You could use that to lay, to draw a layout too.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.100
Right.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.380
Even though your destination is not ultimately cute.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:18.700
Correct.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.380
But it still lets you drag the widgets around, right?

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:21.680
Yeah.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.200
So, you could still get a good idea of what you want it to look like using that.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:25.480
Yeah.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.420
I guess if you had a really old version of Visual Basic laying around.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:28.820
Yes.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:29.620
That also works.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.700
I thought about that.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.380
The VV6.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.820
I mean, that thing went out of support like in the 90s, but you might get it to run.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.220
But yeah, the Balsamic one.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.920
I really like this.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.380
I've used this for prototyping a couple of things.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.880
I think I used it a lot when I was building the Tuck Python training platform and stuff like that.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:54.420
But it's one of these wireframe type of tools that like specifically is not meant to look native or finished.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:55.060
Right.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.260
It kind of looks as if you had drawn it by hand.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:01.740
Like the web browser, it's sort of wiggly lines as if you had sketched that out.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:01.880
Right.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.480
I like this thing a lot.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.280
It's a good recommendation.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:04.580
Yeah.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.340
I really like it.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:10.140
It's not super expensive and it does a good job of sketching the ideas that you have in your head.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:10.400
Yeah.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:10.980
For sure.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.560
A couple of live stream comments.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.000
Just to get a quick shout out to you.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.040
Alexander says, interesting.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.660
Sounds like React in Python when we're talking about the event bubbling.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:18.960
Yeah.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.380
Very cool.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.120
And then David has equated you to Brian Okken.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.180
Mike is to Python GUIs as Brian Okken is to pytest.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:26.700
Yeah.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.100
So really cool.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:32.660
I guess one more general concept let's talk about a little bit before we maybe just touch

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:37.420
on some of the lessons and whatnot from the various apps and the types of things that people could

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.280
go play around with.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.300
And I'm guessing the source code for these apps is on GitHub available.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.720
Even if people don't have the book, they could probably go dig it up.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.420
Yes, it is.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:45.660
Yeah.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.140
Same.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.980
Same for all my stuff.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.160
And the extra thing that I really want to talk about is layout.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.620
So layout's interesting, right?

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.460
You've got these different, what are they called?

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.000
Resizers?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.220
Resizers, yes.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:57.500
Yeah.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:02.020
So if you're going to put like two buttons next to each other, then you just want them to

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.620
take up 80% of the space combined and have a little bit of margin or something.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:10.860
If you just put them in a location, well, that might be true for their size at first.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.480
But if you move the window, obviously not so much.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.080
All right.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:14.220
Yeah.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.280
They'll just stay there.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.480
They're not going to move.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.560
They're not going to change size.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.320
Talk about the different layout sizers and how you can combine them.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.660
How do you build like real composed UI worlds with this?

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.340
You know, you could use absolute positioning.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.480
I don't recommend it.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.480
But if you made your frame unresizable, then you could totally do that.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:33.880
Yeah.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.160
But if you want to use sizers, I usually use box sizers.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.960
They support vertical or horizontal alignment.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:48.220
So if you set it for vertical, which I think is the default, it will add the widgets from left to right across, I mean, horizontal.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.980
I get myself all confused.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.520
All right.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.600
Vertical is top to bottom.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.840
Horizontal is left to right.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.300
So as you add them, the widgets will stack in that direction.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.740
And the nice thing is you can nest the sizers.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:13.420
So if I wanted to, you know, add columns, I could put, you know, three or four vertical sizers, box sizers inside of a regular horizontal sizer or vice versa to just create these kind of stacks of widgets on my UI.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:13.800
All right.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.700
So let's think about this.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:28.260
So imagine I want to build like a photo viewer thing and I want on the left, I want a vertical list of all of the image names, you know, just the short image names, then maybe folders.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.680
And I click the folder and then in the right, I get like a grid of photos.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:40.640
So overall, I've got the panel and then I would put a vertical sizer that has the two pieces, right?

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.480
Yes, probably.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:48.120
The one on the left would be another vertical sizer that just takes a bunch of like little image name display and things.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.200
And on the right, maybe a horizontal one.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.560
Or does it have to wrap?

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.660
Would that wrap around?

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.960
Or would it just shoot off the screen to the right eventually or make them really small or something like that?

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.880
It should make them smaller if you make it too small.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:09.320
But you can also set size hints in Dabix Python that says, do not reduce this window beyond, you know, like 400 by 400 pixels or whatever it is.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.880
Okay, just get like a scroll bar or something like that.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.820
Yeah, you can tell.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.400
So that's actually a different widget.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.260
There's a scrollable panel that you could add.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:21.220
And then the scroll bar will appear when you resize as appropriate.

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:21.620
Right.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:21.920
Okay.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:27.080
Another way you could do that is use a splitter window and then have your widgets, some widgets on the right and some on the left.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:27.400
Interesting.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:27.960
Okay.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.740
So you really have to probably think about how do you compose these things, though?

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.500
There's not like one super duper layout that's just going to do all this stuff.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.420
You're like, here's a section.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.600
There's a section, right?

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:38.920
Yeah.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.800
I mean, there is a flex grid sizer and a grid sizer.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:48.460
So if you know your layout is going to be kind of in a grid shape, you could use one of those grid sizers and lay them out that way.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:53.400
They're a little bit confusing to work with at first because you're trying to figure out, you know, where does everything go?

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.280
They work great for like a calculator because that's a grid.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:56.620
Right.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:56.860
Okay.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:57.180
But.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.840
And they're probably not changing.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.580
It's a fixed number of nine or whatever.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:02.120
Yeah.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:02.800
Things are going in there.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.900
And you could nest, you know, box sizes inside of the grids to make, give yourself more flexibility.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:07.520
Mm-hmm.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.460
Make the return button bigger or something like that as it stretches.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.800
I believe you can make each cell in a grid sizer stretch differently.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.540
So you don't actually need to do the nesting.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:24.320
I was thinking more like if you needed to like have stacks of widgets in a cell within the grid sizer, then you might need to put a different sizer inside of it.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:24.560
Yeah.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.180
Okay.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:25.720
Very neat.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.900
Quick feedback from the live stream.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.860
Matt Robinson says in my last company, we used a bunch of Wix Python.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.280
Your book was an awesome resource.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.000
Super cool.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:33.500
Oh, cool.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.120
Awesome.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:34.740
Yeah.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:34.860
Yeah.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.160
Very good.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:35.620
All right.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:48.240
Now let's go on and talk about some of the apps in your book because I think, you know, thinking about like what are the kinds of apps I could build with this framework reasonably and stuff that fits in a book usually has to fit that reasonable category.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:54.320
It's not like, well, we're going to build Microsoft Word and like, you know, something that does a zillion things.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:06.100
So let's see the first one that you had there was really the first meaningful one was like an image viewer, which is a little bit like like a simpler version of what I'd sort of just described.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.360
Right.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:06.760
Yes.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:12.080
I chose the image viewer because I know it wouldn't take a lot of code to create something that just shows you an image on screen.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:19.820
And because JPEG's Python uses pillow underneath, it can support most image types natively, which is really handy.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:20.160
Yeah.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:27.300
It supports, you know, the list is like seven or eight different formats, ping, JPEG, GIF and on and on.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:27.460
Right.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.360
Which is something that TK Enter doesn't do.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.420
It only supports like two or three natively.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.920
And then you have to import pillow.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.220
Yeah.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.300
Give us a BMP and you're like, how do I get a BMP?

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.080
Like in a TIFF?

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:36.640
Like where did it?

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.680
Yeah.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.780
It gets very unhappy if you do that.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.080
Yeah.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:40.860
That's cool.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:50.540
And then it started out as just, you've got a button that says choose a file and then you show it on one of these, these image widgets, which is pretty straightforward.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:57.800
But, you know, I was still impressed that when you click the button, it's like a really clear way to open a dialogue that is the native dialogue.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:03.220
So in your case, you used your Mac file dialogue and it has like all the stuff you'd expect on the left.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:09.500
It's got like your favorites and your tags and, you know, whatever customizations you've done to your binder, whatever.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:09.900
Yeah.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.140
Because JBS Python does their native.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:12.860
Exactly.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:21.340
And it's always drove me crazy that like, oh, I know on the real OS, I can navigate to another folder this way, but now I'm just hitting the up arrow over and over again.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:26.360
And, you know, it's just those little things, you know, they just, it's nice to have it native.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.180
Yes, I agree.

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.640
I feel your pain.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.220
Yeah.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:39.220
So to like, for example, open up file dialogue, you create a context manager and you just say with, I don't remember the exact command, but you give it basically the file description.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:44.400
And then the file filter and you say open and you just check to see if they hit okay versus cancel.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.280
And then you work with it in the, within the context.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.280
All the WX Python dialogues.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:54.580
And I think maybe even the frames support using them as a context manager to open and show them.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:54.840
Yeah.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:00.940
It would make sense if you wanted to create the equivalent of a modal dialogue, but a custom one that you create, put that in a width block too.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:01.140
Right.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:01.580
Would that work?

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.520
If you inherit from Dabix dialogue, I believe it well.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:04.880
Yes.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.260
Okay.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:05.880
Yeah.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.380
Super neat.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.400
So I guess you probably have to learn your class hierarchy.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.320
It sounds like I got to know.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.800
I got, I, this one derives from frame.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.680
That one derives from dialogue.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.760
Unfortunately, there is a bit of a learning curve.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.100
Yes.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:26.480
But once you've got the, the top level widgets figured out, which are frame dialogue and window, and you almost never use window, you know, you're not too bad.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:26.780
Yeah.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.360
All right.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:34.400
Another one that you built was the database viewer based on SQLAlchemy, object list view, and so on.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.140
And tell us about that.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:40.220
So I actually wrote this example a long time ago for my blog, and then I updated it for my book.

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:56.520
I've always liked SQLAlchemy, and I realized that I could create a SQLAlchemy model class and use it with Dabix Python because they have a third party widget called the object list view that basically matches a model in SQLAlchemy almost exactly.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.340
So I can kind of combine the two classes and make them work together in a way.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.080
So that's kind of what I did.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.520
I just made it so that I could open up a SQLite database in the book.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:10.000
Do you basically see the tables and then click on them and get the records or something like that?

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.360
Yes.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.220
You can see the records.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:17.140
I think I made it so I can edit the records too, or maybe that was just on my blog that I did that.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:17.320
Yeah.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.400
What widget do you use that shows basically the Excel looking view?

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.620
That's object list view.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:26.660
Dabix Python has its own native widget called WRX list control.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:33.420
And object list view is kind of a wrapper of that widget that makes it a lot easier to work with, in my opinion.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:33.800
Yeah.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.000
What about animations?

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:42.440
I know that doesn't have anything to do with the app that we're talking about, but is there some sort of support for changing the screen?

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:51.040
Or if I'm going to put something on the screen, like I want to build a dashboard that is maybe looking at all the analytics on our system and it updates once a second.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.460
How easy is that to do?

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.200
So if you're talking like a graph?

00:39:54.440 --> 00:40:06.320
A graph or even if it just has numbers, like here's the current flow rate of such and such or the number of users on the site versus like the minutes of video watch today up to date by the second.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.040
Something like that.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:07.240
Yeah.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.380
You have a couple of options.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.960
Dabix widgets has a, I believe it's called a device context.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.200
Dabix.dc.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.320
It has a couple of different variants of that.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.780
You can use it to basically draw whatever you want.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.680
And it's the basis for creating a lot of the custom widgets that you'll see in the Dabix Python demo.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.980
So you could use that to like draw any custom widgets you want.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.440
I see.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.940
So you're just given like a rectangle or whatever and just go crazy with the draw commands on it.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.280
Yes.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:37.180
The alternative is that Dabix Python supports matplotlib and can embed it easily.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.700
And it also has its own pyplot library.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.780
So it can draw them without matplotlib itself.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.060
So both of those are also options.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:45.460
Yeah.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.140
Very nice.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:51.820
What's the external like super custom control world look like?

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:56.640
So we've got the Wix widgets, but are there like other third party libraries that you get?

00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:03.260
Like, oh, here's like a really fancy editable grid type of thing or auto completing drop downs or,

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.400
you know, is there an ecosystem around those types of things?

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:11.560
And I remember in Visual Basic and like Windows forums, there was like whole companies based around

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.500
building those little extensions.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:18.620
Well, I know that I know the object list view was a third party one for a while and it still

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.320
is third party.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:25.900
But I think the actual C++ version of it has outstripped the current wrapper for it.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.500
So it's the current wrapper doesn't follow it very well anymore.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:33.440
Besides that, there used to be a guy, Andrea Gavanna, I believe is his name.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.320
He created a ton of awesome custom widgets for Dabix Python.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.160
And eventually they got wrapped into the Python framework itself.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:47.580
So now it's like import WX.agw and you have access to all of those custom widgets within

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:48.400
Dabix Python.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:55.140
But besides those, there's not a lot out there that I can think of that are like just custom

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.160
ones you'd add on.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:56.480
Right.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.920
I was doing some quick searching for whether or not there's like an awesome list, basically,

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.400
for those types of things.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.860
I couldn't find it, but maybe people, someone out there knows the one, they can send it

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.100
to us and I'll put it in the show notes.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:08.360
Cool.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:08.720
Yeah.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.240
Cool.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:15.600
So another one that you built was one that would look at basically zip files or tarball

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.840
and pull those apart.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.520
Yeah.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.920
What are some of the cool takeaways from that?

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:24.600
Oh, for me, it was fun to dig into Python's native Tarian libraries, which I haven't played

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.220
with that much.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:30.480
And I was originally going to include the zip file, but zip files tended to be more buggy when

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.300
I was playing with it.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.460
So I just stuck with tarballs to keep it simple.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:37.900
But the main takeaway is that it works really well with WX Python.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:43.980
I try to show newer concepts like Pathlib in this book using, you know, in conjunction with

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.300
the tar file library.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:46.660
Yeah.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.460
Pathlib is nice.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:47.800
Yeah.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.160
It's not entirely obvious when you first get to it that the division operator been taken

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:52.540
over.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.840
No, it's not.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.800
To combine elements.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.680
But at the same time, it is quite neat once you learn it.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:58.880
Yeah.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.120
The syntax always throws me when I see those examples.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:01.860
I'm like, what?

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:02.520
Oh, yeah.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:03.600
All right.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.180
That's how it works.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:04.680
Yeah.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.740
All same thing for date time and time deltas.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.300
Nice.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:07.660
Yes.

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.440
And then you mix those with f-strings and you get into a whole other world.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.440
Absolutely.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.240
All right.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.780
Another one that you discussed was creating an application for NASA's API.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.300
I don't know what NASA's API is, but that sounds fun.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.000
Tell us about that.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:28.060
So this one was actually recommended to me by the Kickstarter people that were back to the

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:28.280
book.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:33.580
They were like, so whenever I do a Kickstarter, I ask the backers, what ideas do you guys have?

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.380
What do you think will be a good addition?

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:40.260
And someone was like, well, NASA's API is basically open source.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.900
You can query it if you have a license API key.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.280
And you can make it show you basically any pictures that NASA has publicly available.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:54.000
So the NASA API will let you get photos of the moon, get photos of their launches, get

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.940
photos of Mars, you know, whatever.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:56.780
Nice.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:01.540
And they really wanted an example of how do you make Dibix Python hook up to a web API?

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.260
So that's kind of what this chapter is about.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:04.500
Yeah.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.680
That's a pretty cool example, right?

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.940
There's a lot of fun stuff that you can check out there.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:09.620
Yeah.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:10.640
It was fun.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.280
So at api.nasa.gov, you can go over there and yeah, there's a bunch of stuff.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:21.460
Pad maps for the moons, two-line element data for earth elements orbiting the earth.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.000
Yes.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.600
You update it in real time and so on.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:24.920
Yeah.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.540
Nice.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.680
So what did you end up actually building?

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.240
Like there's a bunch of APIs there.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:35.100
I think this one only like loads, it has a, basically a list control widget, which I use

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.280
to display the search results when you query the NASA search.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.100
And then when you click on them, it will load the image.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:47.640
So, you know, if I looked up like Challenger space flight or Apollo or whatever, it'll show

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:52.480
all the public NASA images in that list box and you can click on them and it will load the

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.140
picture for you.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.160
So you can view the picture.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:54.600
Yeah.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.360
There's a ton of room for improvement, like how to download the picture, which I believe

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.560
I covered how to download it with the GUI.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.640
But you could also, you know, add a tag editor.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.500
So you could view the metadata in the images.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:06.900
Right.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.480
And then you could browse it by show me all the pictures of the shuttle or, you know, things

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.080
from this mission or something like that.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:13.880
Or from this date.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.140
Yeah.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:14.340
Yeah.

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:14.680
Cool.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.540
That seems like a really fun thing to play with.

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:20.540
And just people who are looking to have a fun API out there in the world to choose.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:21.780
That seems like a neat one.

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:22.920
Yeah, it was really neat.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.220
Yeah.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.040
Super cool.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.440
So I guess, you know, there's a bunch of other stuff that we could talk about that

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.180
you wrote about.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:34.640
But I think one maybe final thing, one of the challenges that's not immediately obvious with

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:40.660
Python is how do I take my Python code and give it to somebody so they can put it in their

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:46.280
doc or their taskbar as a picture and click it and see it without them, without discussing,

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.740
here's how you create a virtual environment.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.280
Here's how you have the right version of Python.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.900
Here's how you pip install the requirements.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:55.860
How do you distribute this as what normal people would perceive as an application?

00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:02.200
Well, fortunately, the major Python GUI builder, executable builders support WX Python.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:09.100
So in the book, I use PyInstaller as an example, because it can package up WX Python pretty easily.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:09.560
Okay.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:15.340
You have to give it a special command line argument to tell it that it's a windowed application

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.840
versus a terminal application.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.280
Right.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.480
I think maybe the default is to also have a terminal window.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:25.320
It would distribute it, but you have an odd terminal window just to the side of your app.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:25.580
Yeah.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.300
So if you have like any debug in your application, it'd show up in the terminal window, which,

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.700
you know, might not be ideal.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:31.080
Yeah.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.100
No, for sure.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.080
So I cover that in the book.

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.880
The nice thing about PyInstallers, it also works for creating executables on Mac and

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.720
Windows.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.820
Not all of them do that.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:45.820
I have used Py2XE pretty extensively over the years, and it works great for Windows.

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.480
But, you know, again, it's not going to work for anything else.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:48.800
Right.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.960
So you found PyInstaller was pretty reliable across the platforms?

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.260
Yeah, it works really well.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:59.400
The only problem I have is that I think if you do the all-in-one file, Windows Defender

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.880
will mark it as malicious and delete it.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.520
Oh, that's not good.

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:07.220
And I think it does that for, you know, whether it's a WX Python file or not.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:13.060
Anytime you create the one file executable with PyInstaller, it's like, oh, that's a bad

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:13.360
file.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.460
I'm going to delete it for you.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.140
Not ideal.

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:15.760
No.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:16.940
I think you can...

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:21.500
Someone must have used it to try to package up a virus or something at one point, and

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.940
then it got fingerprinted and that was that.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:24.360
Yeah.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:29.120
I think you can self-sign the file or something to get around that, but I didn't go into that

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:29.500
in the book.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:29.640
Yeah.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:33.640
I think you got to register as a developer with Microsoft to get like a signing certificate

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.280
or something.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:34.780
Mm-hmm.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.100
I don't think I've ever done that.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.940
So, but there are, like when you say try to run it, you know, same thing on Mac.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.360
It could either, sometimes it'll completely block it.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:46.720
Sometimes it'll say that came from the internet, but we kind of recognize that person.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.580
Or I guess if you super duper sign it, it'll just run.

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.000
Yes.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.320
Yeah.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.940
Depending on the platform.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:56.720
So another thing, you know, one thing that I did is I created this little app that runs

00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:02.960
in the Mac menu bar, and I created that with Py2App, and then it just gives people a .app

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.180
file, well, zipped up, but then you unzip it, it's a .app file.

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:06.480
Yeah.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.300
And then you can just run it, and that's worked well.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:13.260
But like Py2Exe, Py2App is a Mac-only thing, right?

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.080
Like one platform.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.380
I know Py2App also works with WXPython, my experience.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:17.780
Yeah.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:22.180
These sort of packaging utilities, they work pretty well for the different platforms.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.480
If you're using .duvx Python.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.160
Yes.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:24.820
Yep.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.180
I haven't had any problems with them.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:30.260
You can get squirrely things with other packages, but not usually with WX.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:30.620
Yeah.

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:31.040
Very cool.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:31.900
All right, Mike.

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:38.800
Well, I think about is all the time we have to talk about GUIs and stuff, at least .duvx

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.200
Python.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.800
But give us your verdict.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.860
Is there something you enjoy working with, building apps that people are liking with it?

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.820
I don't know about other people, but I still use it whenever I can.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:55.040
For work, I'll create simple apps to demo whatever I need to demo to my employer or my PM.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:00.100
So, I mean, you can still throw together a really simple app with WX Python and only a hundred lines,

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.600
or, you know, a couple hundred lines.

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:04.840
And they'll show off something that looks awesome across platforms.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.520
Yeah, very cool.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.720
Yeah, again, I know I keep going on and on, but the native bits just make me happy.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.580
A quick couple of questions from the live stream.

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.100
One is, it doesn't want to show up.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:15.640
There you go.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:20.880
If I purchase the book, WX Python recipes, is it still relevant or outdated?

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.200
I'm not familiar with this book.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:22.340
Yeah.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:23.340
Is this yours?

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.740
I have a WX Python cookbook from A-Press.

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.880
I believe the examples in it still work, but they're kind of like all over the place.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:35.340
I tried to group them intelligently, but I mean, they're helpful, but they're not going to

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.300
like help you.

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:40.760
I don't know how to describe it, but they're more like, these are very specific things.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.980
So read the table of contents before you buy that one.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.800
If he's talking about Cody Precord's book, which is Dibbix Python recipes from Pact Publishing.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.160
I haven't read it in a while, so I don't remember.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.060
Yeah.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.260
And I have no experience with it either.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.800
So, but you can check out this one.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.960
This has got at least 10 good little apps in it for sure.

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.160
Yeah.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:58.540
Okay.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:03.960
So I guess with that, I'll ask you the final two questions that I always ask everyone.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.920
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor are you using these days?

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.080
I'm still a big fan of Wing IDE from Wingware.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.140
Cool.

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:16.180
So I hear a lot of people on the VS Code wagon these days, like why Wing?

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:22.260
For me, I still like that it has a source, what do you call it, a source assistant, which

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:27.320
basically shows you the doc strings and links to the documentation live at all times for

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.340
whatever line of code you're on.

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.800
So, you know, if you've imported something, it'll show you all that stuff and basically

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.280
help you learn new modules as you work.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.600
The other thing I really like is the debugger.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.120
The debugger on it is really good.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:39.460
Yeah.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:39.920
Fantastic.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:40.560
Okay.

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.800
And then notable PyPI package.

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.960
I mean, there's always WX Python if you want to throw that one out there, but you got

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:47.600
another one in mind.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:53.440
For me, it would probably be OpenPyXL because I've been working with it a lot the last couple

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:53.820
of months.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:59.580
So OpenPyXL basically lets you read and write Excel files, the newer format, right?

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.700
The XLSX version.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:02.420
Yes, it does.

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.760
And you can do formulas and formatting and everything.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.440
Is that right?

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.460
Am I...

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:10.080
Formulas are kind of iffy, but the rest of it is, it does do.

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:10.500
Nice.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.180
Pretty cool.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:17.220
So many people, I'm sure, receive Excel files all of the time and they want to process

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:20.080
it with code rather than with a mouse and keyboard.

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.040
So very nice.

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:21.760
Awesome.

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.120
Awesome.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:22.880
All right.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.220
Well, final call to action.

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:26.040
People want to get started with WX Python.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:26.580
What do they do?

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:31.400
They can check out my book or you can just go to WXPython.org and get everything you need

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.000
right there.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:32.400
Awesome.

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:32.640
Yeah.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.280
And I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.480
So thanks everyone for listening.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:39.760
And Mike, thanks for all you're doing around the GUI stuff.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.180
Thank you so much for having me.

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:41.560
You bet.

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:41.880
Bye.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:42.240
Bye.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:46.040
