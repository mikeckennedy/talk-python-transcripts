If you want to get better at something, oftentimes the path is pretty clear.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.520
If you want to get better at swimming, you go to the pool and practice your strokes

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.880
and put in time doing the laps. Want to get better at mountain biking?

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.400
Hit the trails and work on drills focusing on different aspects of riding.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.320
You can do the same for programming.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.840
Reuven Lerner is back on the podcast to talk about his book, Pandas Workout.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.200
We dive into strategies for learning pandas in Python,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.360
as well as some of his workout exercises.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.200

Before we jump into the interview, I want to let you know that we still have some spots left in my

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.960
Code in a Castle event. If you're looking to learn some of the premier frameworks and techniques in

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.200
Python, and you'd like to have a bucket list type of experience while doing so,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.920
then check out talkpython.fm/castle.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.480
In October, I'll be running a six day Python course for an intimate audience in a villa in

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.040
Tuscany. Half the time we'll be learning Python and the other half will be exploring the best of

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.920
what Italy has to offer. Check out the course outline, the excursions and all the details at

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.040
talkpython.fm/castle. Or if you'd like to just shoot me an email, michael@talkpython.fm or find

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.920
me on the socials and I'm happy to talk about it. Hope to see you there.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.000
Ruven, welcome back to Talk Python To Me. How are you doing?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.880
I'm doing great. Great to be back here. Nice to see you.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.080
Yeah, it's great to see you as well. I'm a little concerned though.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.560
There's some possibilities that maybe my Facebook ads are going to get messed up.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.360
We are talking about pandas and pandas internationally. And I heard that you're

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.080
some kind of animal trafficker. Do you want to start the show with that story? It's out of control.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.320
It is the craziest story. So I occasionally advertise on Facebook, advertise my pandas

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.280
and Python training. And I guess it was like two years ago, I tried doing a little bit more

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.920
advertising. And basically I didn't really pay much attention to it until about a year ago

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.880
when I noticed that when I tried to do some more advertising and it said,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.880
you are not allowed to advertise on any meta properties. That's really weird. Like, what did

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.120
I do? I looked, I could not find any indication of what I'd done wrong. So it says, if you want

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.840
to appeal, click here. So I clicked here and within 30 minutes or so, I get email back saying,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.320
your appeal has been checked and denied. You will never be allowed to advertise on

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.720
any meta property again. And this was like, what have I done? Like, what are you doing?

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.000
I feel like I'm pretty innocent. You're some courses and some books. Come on, man.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.920
I'd like, I figured also I appealed, someone must've looked through this. Anyway, in poking

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.920
around online, someone said to me, oh, I was caught by the same thing. It is illegal to sell

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.400
rare and endangered animals. And they believe that since you were selling Python and pandas

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.400
training, then you must've been trading in live and endangered animals and thus you are banned

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.440
for life. Well, I said, you know what? I got some, first of all, like nuts and yet a great story to

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.840
tell to my machine learning classes. So good on that front. But I was like, this is easy to resolve,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.720
right? I'll just contact someone at Facebook. No one's available. I got texts on my connections,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.760
like people I know who work there. And I finally get the answer back saying that for legal purposes,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.120
they delete all data that's more than six months old, something like that. So they could not go

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.080
back and check to see why I was banned. And thus this ban really would be for life. So because I

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.520
waited a while, cause it'd been like a year between the ban and me noticing. So they couldn't

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.280
do anything about it. So I was like half laughing and half like, you gotta be kidding me about this.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.200
Um, and I posted on my blog about this and you guys picked it up. on Python bites,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.960
it was picked up in a bunch of other places like hacker news. And about a month later I check and

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.200
it was back. No one told me anything. No one said anything just magically and quietly. My account

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.280
was restored. so they can never helps. That's right. That's right. But it was so

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.400
absurd. I think it was at least like four senior engineers at Facebook who tried to help me with

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.120
this. And they're all like, we tried, there's nothing we can do. Crazy. It reminds me, honestly,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.600
it reminds me so much of my app store review experience, getting the new Talk Python Training

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.720
mobile apps in iOS and the apps in the iOS app store and the Google app store. They were

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.560
tragically incompetent in their own special way. Right? Somewhat malicious, somewhat not malicious,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.320
just like for example, Apple, I think it was Apple. It could have been, I don't know,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.880
Apple or Google has to be one of them said, you know, we've denied your application to publish

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.880
this application because you're trying to impersonate in an existing one. I said, what

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.840
app am I trying? What am I trying to impersonate? Like it's hundreds of hours of stuff that we've

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.320
created. Like they're like, well, first you might be hijacked. So, so what this is, well,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.120
in the description it says, if you want to learn Python, you can take our courses. Well, there's

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.280
already an app called learn Python and you're trying to impersonate. I'm like, what? They're

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.080
like, it said, if you want to learn Python, but there's an app called learn Python. I'm like,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.800
I just, I don't even under like my mind is how do you read that description and think this is

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.320
a trademark? So if you come up with an app called like eat at a restaurant, then no food ordering,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.720
yeah. You're going to be acquired by UberEATS straight away. Exactly. And so we went, but we,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.000
you would think, okay, fair mistake. Like, yeah, yeah. Okay. Something caught it. Just,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.760
just like you said, a simple request and a human will look and it'd be fine. No, they're like,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.840
well, look, obviously you're doing this. I'm like, obviously let's try another scenario.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.320
What if I said I wanted to learn to play the guitar and there was an app called learn guitar,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.240
but I don't want to learn. It's not, it's not, the title is not learn guitar. Just

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.480
the act of learning a guitar. How else would you explain it? Like, oh, okay. So I guess we,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.800
we see, we understand now you can, you can have that sentence. And it's just,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.600
these things are really, and you're at the, at the complete mercy of them. It's, it's really,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.320
it's both like comically funny, but it's also like painful because we spent four months building

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.920
that app. They wouldn't accept for this stupid reason, you know? And they're taking a fair

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.400
amount of money off the top for whatever people are earning from these apps. It's not like this

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:16.720
is a charity or something. What I found amazing with Facebook was there was literally no way to

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.640
contact a human being. Like I tried all sorts of searches and forms and on, on, and on. And like,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.080
and, and I found a lot of other people who had been caught up in this sort of ridiculous

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.320
situation, but like, there's no form even to say, Hey, I think you made a mistake. Why don't you

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.160
have a human look at this? Because that would cost them too much, you know, someone's salary.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.560
Absolutely. It's anyway, I don't want to spend too much time on it, but boy, is that a crazy story?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.160
I mean, we're going to be trading in some, we'll be trading in some pandas today. And so I just,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.760
I'm going to bleep that part. Every time the word pandas is said, we're bleeping it out on

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.120
the YouTube version. Well, this could be entertaining then. Wow. Reuben was really

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:04.160
testy. Like all those bleeps. No, seriously though. You know, let's, let's catch up. We'll

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.400
talk about your book. What have you been up to since the last time we spoke? I can't remember

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.680
last time I had you on. It's been a couple of years, I think. It's been, it's been some time.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.800
Yeah. So I'm continuing to do Python pandas training companies. Since the pandemic,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.920
much more of it is online just because companies are now used to doing stuff on Zoom,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.080
team, WebEx, rather than bringing me there in person. That's fine. So I travel to conferences

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.080
rather than to clients. And, you know, it sort of extended my flexibility on that. And I've also

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.360
been building up my online training stuff, both a whole lot of courses. And I've got an online

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.520
bootcamp that I run for Python and Pandas twice a year. The big thing, which is actually connected

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.920
to what we're doing here also is I have a new newsletter called Bamboo Weekly, where I have

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.480
pandas exercises. It's sort of like the same style as the book, but every week I take a topic and I

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.320
do it, I do it based on current events. So if there's something going on in the news, I try to

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.200
find a dataset, a real world dataset that has something to do with that. And then we, we try

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.880
to experiment with that. Yeah, that's actually fun to see like a real world example every week.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.320
Yeah. Yeah. So people are like, how do you come up with that? And I say, well, I listen to a lot

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.840
of podcasts and I read a lot of newspapers and something somewhere, like I read The Economist,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.800
for example, and they had this short, cute article about the number of animals that go

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.440
through Heathrow airport every year. I was like, wait, there's gotta be a dataset for that. And

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.320
sure enough, the Heathrow airport authority publishes a dataset in CSV of how many animals

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.920
go through. And it was like 200 horses and one and a half billion butterflies and everything in

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:39.360
between. And so it was great fun to sort of play with that data and ask questions about it and

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.120
give people practice with something that's dirty and messy. I don't mean the animals being dirty,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.400
right? Like very messy. Like you need to like really, you know, wrestle with it because that's

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.160
the only way you're going to improve. So I'm, I'm having a lot of fun on all the, the training

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.800
front. I definitely see more and more use of, I'm sure this won't surprise you, more and more use of

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.320
Python in the data space as it just like catches fire there. Yeah. It's just going downhill,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.920
picking up speed, isn't it? It's extraordinary. Like I still remember asking people in my intro

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.840
Python courses. So what are you here for? They're like, yeah, my company's thinking of doing some

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.920
stuff with data analysis and pandas. And, or at least as data analysis, I think it was then even

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.640
in NumPy before pandas came out and me thinking, Hmm, I should really learn this stuff because it

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.080
sounds like it's going to be popular and holy cow, it's like, it's everywhere. And the whole ecosystem

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.240
is just growing and growing and growing. It's like people are sort of seeing pandas as the like

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.000
underlying infrastructure on which they build their software tools and their companies.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.160
Right. Or even the thing that defines the API on which they can innovate, right? Think Dask or a

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.480
whole bunch of other things in that space. Right. That if you know pandas, chances are, if you're

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.760
not too crazy, you can like do grid computing by changing the import. It's extraordinary.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:54.000
Just extraordinary. Yeah. Yeah, it absolutely is. And so back to your newsletter, pandas eat bamboo.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.120
Is that right? That's so, I understand why you're back on Facebook. Okay. All right.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:04.160
It was actually my father's idea. I was like, I need a catchy name for something. And so he was

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.000
like, well, we'll have something with bamboo. I was like, right, right. It's like, it's food for

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.080
thought and food for pandas. Yeah. Yeah. That's actually really clever. I like it a lot. I like

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.040
it a lot. So you've been on a journey. You've been on a journey to write a book, right?

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.560
Yes. I was convinced to do a second one. Right. So I did a book with Manning called Python workout,

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.080
which was exercise in Python. And when that finished, they said, so what other topics do

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.920
you think would be useful? I said, well, doing a lot of pandas and people definitely need a lot

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.120
of exercise and a lot of practice in that. And so I got to work both collecting the exercises I do

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.280
with my corporate training and also like coming up with some new ones as I learn new things.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:47.120
Cause pandas is so, so, so huge that it's very easy to get lost in there and not even know what

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.080
are the important topics to learn. And, and so thanks to like working with people all the time,

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.520
I sort of see also where they get stuck and where they have problems and where it's really confusing

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:01.520
to them. So, yeah, so 200 and somewhat exercises later, by the way, I'll just tell you why did it

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.600
come out when it came out? Cause I'm terribly bad at deadlines. I said to the Manning people,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.560
I really want to have it at my booth at PyCon. They said, okay, big talker, you want it mid May,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.080
huh? So you'd better have everything done. And they sort of backtracked on the calendar and said,

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.160
okay, so you've got to have the whole thing done by December. And then finally I had some like,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.800
you know, fire under me and got it done. I supposed to get bored.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.160
Yeah. The version I actually have in my Apple books here I pulled up is the Manning early

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.520
access preview version, but it's out, out for real now. Yeah.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.520
Here. I've even got the paper copy here.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.720
Look at that.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.280
I know.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.560
That's a pretty hefty book, honestly.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.680
I still keep looking at it, baby.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.560
That's a proper book.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.640
It's like, wow. I know. I know. It feels like it's really quite some feeling there to see.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.080
I guess I really finished it.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.600
Congratulations. So I wanted to talk to you about maybe just kind of following on with

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.600
your bamboo idea, like give us some examples, give us some problems that people are solving

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.680
with pandas. And I mean, we're not going to talk through the code super detailed,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.160
but you could say like this aspect or this feature of pandas like dot look or whatever

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.240
is how you access and solve these problems. Right. Like, so just kind of exploring that space. I had

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.160
West McKinney on before five episodes ago, something like that. And I was just like,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.120
how do you learn pandas? It's like so big, you know?

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.400
So I've actually changed. Well, let me, let me, let me first say, I'm definitely one of those

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.600
people who thinks you should learn Python before pandas. Like, I definitely think that knowing the

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.920
language well, will serve you very, very well, in all sorts of weird, small ways necessarily.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.000
But at the same time, when you learn pandas, you have to learn that some of the paradigms you

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.440
learned, like some of the idioms from Python are not appropriate. So I was giving a class in like

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.440
optimizing pandas, like a short class, we'll call it microclass, like 90 minutes long,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.040
about a year or so ago. And at the end, I was like, oh, and by the way,

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.160
obviously just never do for loops. And everyone's like, wait, wait, wait, what?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.440
I said, what do you mean? What? And they were like, we were taught in our intro pandas class

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.200
that you should do a for loop to do anything across the data frame. And I was like, okay,

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:06.000
what? How can this be? And so people think that because it's in Python, you should do it the same

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.800
way, but there are all these different idioms, especially whole vectorization that you need to

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:16.240
internalize. Otherwise, as I like to say to people, you should hope to be paid by the hour

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.280
because like these things are just gonna take forever to run. And so people like don't

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.600
necessarily understand sort of how to approach panda stuff. And then they don't understand sort

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.000
of, let's see, I mean, I'll give like, like outline and then we can sort of go into it.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.400
Certainly how to access things with dot lock, certainly how multi indexes work,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.400
how to, how to work with the different D types. these are, cause these are things that we

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.840
don't think about in the standard pandas world each day, right? The closest analogy would maybe

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.120
be that where you were working with dictionary, you want to think about what your keys are going

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.480
to be, but even then it doesn't come close to it. So like dot lock people are like, so, so fine. So

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.920
dot lock is used for retrieving from a series or retrieving from a data frame. But it's so much

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:03.600
more than that because you have two parts to it or potentially two parts. You have the row selector

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:09.200
and you have the column selector and each of those can be an individual name, a list of names, a

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.000
Boolean series, or even a Lambda. And you can mix and match those in so many different ways. And

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.120
once you see those options, like your head sort of explodes with, Oh wait, I never thought that I

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.360
could access my data like that. And then you're like, wait, you can also assign your data like

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.640
that. And then they're just sort of astonished. Yeah. It's really wild. You know, I think pandas

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:34.080
has its own idiomatic style that is different than what you would call Pythonic, right? Like

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:40.480
it's Pandonic. I don't know what the name is, but idiomatic pandas, right? Where there's things that

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:46.640
are specific to pandas, like this vectorization stuff, right? Instead of looping over, right?

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.120
You know, you think about the Python performance angles or the data science performance angles,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.720
right? A lot of the speed that we get out of tools like pandas and NumPy and pullers and others is

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.960
because you take the data, you push it down into some native layer and you just leave it there.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.000
And you tell, you kind of speak to the native layer from Python and you say, deep down in your

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.880
insides, you got this thing, multiply all 1 million of them by two or whatever. Right. But if

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:17.120
you loop over it, you're like kind of running out of C into, into, you know, Python objects, then

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.800
you're operating out, then you're putting it back, like just, you know, 2 million times, all of a

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.360
sudden, all those benefits are gone. And so certainly learning those types of things. I mean,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.000
the vectorization, I think most people get pretty soon, although it sounds like not necessarily

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.600
everyone. I was really like flabbergasted. But there's way more than that, right? There's,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.920
there's a whole, that's just probably the most obvious thing.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:43.920
This portion of Talk Python to me is brought to you by Sentry. Code breaks. It's a fact of life.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:49.840
With Sentry, you can fix it faster. As I've told you all before, we use Sentry on many of our apps

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.120
and APIs here at Talk Python. I recently used Sentry to help me track down one of the weirdest

00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.560
bugs I've run into in a long time. Here's what happened. When signing up for our mailing list,

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:06.080
it would crash under a non-common execution pass, like situations where someone was already

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:12.320
subscribed or entered an invalid email address or something like this. The bizarre part was that our

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:19.280
logging of that unusual condition itself was crashing. How is it possible for her log to crash?

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.880
It's basically a glorified print statement. Well, Sentry to the rescue. I'm looking at the crash

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.080
report right now, and I see way more information than you would expect to find in any log statement.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.600
And because it's production, debuggers are out of the question. I see the trace back, of course,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:41.840
but also the browser version, client OS, server OS, server OS version, whether it's production

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.560
or Q&A, the email and name of the person signing up, that's the person who actually experienced

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.880
the crash, dictionaries of data on the call stack, and so much more. What was the problem?

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:58.560
I initialized the logger with the string info for the level rather than the enumeration dot info,

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.080
which was an integer-based enum. So the logging statement would crash, saying that I could not

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:11.600
use less than or equal to between strings and ints. Crazy town. But with Sentry, I captured it,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.720
fixed it, and I even helped the user who experienced that crash. Don't fly blind. Fix

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:22.720
code faster with Sentry. Create your Sentry account now at talkpython.fm/Sentry. And if you

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:29.600
sign up with the code TALKPYTHON, all capital, no spaces, it's good for two free months of Sentry's

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.240
business plan, which will give you up to 20 times as many monthly events as well as other features.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.360
Accessing things in that way, by the way, you asked before, like, how should people even approach

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.400
learning pandas? And so I've started thinking about it a little differently based on feedback

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.520
from people, that I would sort of walk through it. Okay, here's a series, here's a data frame.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.880
And after creating some fake ones with made-up numbers or random numbers, then we'll start

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.200
reading in files. And then we'll do this, and then we'll get to visualization. And a student

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:02.240
of mine said, you know, you're sort of missing the big, like, people miss the big picture doing

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.440
that, and they want to get the excitement. Why don't you start with, read a CSV file, visualize

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.000
it right there inside of Jupyter, and then people will be so impressed and amazed, and then you fill

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.200
in the gaps. And so I've started doing that a bit. And I think that has not been a bad approach to

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.760
catch their attention, give them a sense of what the possibilities are. I'm like, okay, let's now

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.560
walk through each of these little pieces and build up to what we saw that first day. And that's been

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:32.000
fun. Yeah, I totally agree. That's also something that I really strive for. I don't always do

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.040
whenever I'm doing presentations, but, you know, just because someone is chosen to sit in a seat

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.240
for a day long course or an hour long presentation, doesn't mean that they couldn't use a little

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.600
inspiration. Right. And if you can like, wow, you did those three lines, and now we have this

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.480
picture and I understand all that, like, tell me more. Right. That right there. That's right. Right.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.640
Now you have their actual attention the whole time and they're enjoying it. And it's, yeah,

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:59.520
it's so often it's like, well, in order to show you the nice stuff, I got to give you every level

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.840
of details. Like, no, you don't. You're going to, you're going to make them leave. Don't do it that

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.800
way. That's right. That's right. And you mentioned like three lines of code. One of the amazing

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.080
things about pandas is how often you can write very, very little code, but it's like getting

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.720
to that code that takes a while really taking advantage of it. Yeah. We've been knowing that.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.880
Right. Right. Right. Right. People don't even know. So a lot of times, like I've been using

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.440
it now for long enough that I sort of intuit, oh, there's got to be a method that does this. Like

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.240
someone has encountered this problem before. And so either as a method or there's an option

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.680
or there's an add on like something somewhere that just makes it trivially easy. And that's part of

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.280
the exploration that I try to do both in the book and the weekly, like in my training journal. And

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.240
also truth be told, I'm constantly learning stuff, right? Like it's, it's a rare for me to teach and

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.000
not discover some option or some method that I did not know about because it's just so incredibly

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.680
vast. Yeah. Or pandas too comes out or something like that. Yes. Yes, indeed. I mean, I've been

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.080
exploring, I mean tomorrow, tomorrow I head off to Prague for EuroPython, where I'm giving a talk

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:08.240
on a pyarrow in pandas. And so I've been looking into that a lot and oh boy, right. I mean, I've

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.800
been using it for say a year or so, but it's amazing. And yet there are all these subtle

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:17.120
changes that are happening in pandas as a result that you need to know about it. You need to expect

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:23.760
when, when you use it, but it's another like tool in our toolbox that we can pull out to make pandas

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:29.200
more effective, more efficient, deal with larger data and also interact with other and interoperate

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.040
with other systems. Yeah, for sure. It's just like, as I said, the whole ecosystem is just

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.400
exploding. It's really quite something. Yeah, it really is. And I think the pandas too stuff is

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.720
going to make a pretty big difference in changing like the internals away from just tables of

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.640
numbers and basically, okay. Let's talk about, so the way I thought we could maybe explore this

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:52.640
pandas workout book is let's just pick some fun exercises that you put together and, and talk

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.600
about them. Like, give us a quick overview of what the workout aspect of this book means anyway,

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.760
then we'll, we'll pick the first one. Sure. So the idea is that you can't learn everything all

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:09.920
at once or quickly. That's sort of like, you know, working out physically, it's a long haul

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:15.280
and every day you get a little better, a little stronger, a little more flexible. And so if you

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:21.360
see, you know, your pandas learning journey as it's going to take me several months, not, it's

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.440
going to take me a day. Then if every day you do a little bit of practice, you learn something new

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.000
in some new direction. At the end of that journey, you're going to be able to solve many, many more

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.280
problems in better, more idiomatic and more efficient ways. And you'll be able to put these

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.320
pieces together in ways that you didn't even expect. So that's, that's the basic idea. And so

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.920
the book is divided into, I want to say 12 chapters. I know we sort of rejiggered it at

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:49.520
some point where each chapter focuses on a different aspect of pandas. But it's really

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.360
sort of the, the total experience of going through it. And so we have 200 exercises,

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:01.600
plus there's like a, for lack of better term, a midterm and a final, like a media projects that

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:07.120
people can go through that people ask for after the Python book. And each exercise then has not

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.520
only the main exercise where I pose a problem, I give an explanation, I give an answer, note the

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.680
order, the answer comes at the end. So you won't peek as easily. We talked about putting in the

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.520
back of the book and like, that just didn't work out so well. So at least you have to wait through

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.320
the explanation a little bit or turn the page. And then you can buy the one book with the questions.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:34.240
You can buy the answers later. I was joking. I didn't mean, I didn't mean to give anyone ideas.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.680
I'm joking. No, no, it's fine. And then like after the answer, we have three, what we call beyond the

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:46.640
exercise, which are okay. Now that you've kind of gotten the basics, let's push either on the same

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:52.160
data set or even like, like sort of go farther. And so it's like, that's why we say it's 200

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.120
exercises because it's 50 official exercises and other three for each one. And those tend to be

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.120
much harder. And I don't give a full explanation, although I do give the solution online in the

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.200
Jupyter notebook, you can download Jupyter for all these things and see how I solved it. And for

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.000
many of them, there's a link to the pandas tutor. I think, yeah, you've definitely spoken to Philip

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.840
Lowe in the past. So he's not only a Python tutor, but pandas tutor, he and his team, it's amazing.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.720
And so you can just click on a link and it will take you to usually a miniature version of the

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.520
data set because it's too big for pandas tutor. And then you can sort of see the visualization,

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.680
how these things work. Yeah. I haven't, I don't think I talked about pandas tutor. Maybe I have

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:34.880
talked to Philip about it, but I've certainly used it in some of my courses, but it's worth

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.600
bringing up just to talk, like, see how that thing works. It's, it's something special. This

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.800
thing, it really gives you some deep understanding into like, okay, if I run, you know, this group

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.520
by command, then here's how all the pieces like flow back together. And so you're using this

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.320
during your book. So, yeah. So, I mean, every exercise has a link in the solution. You click

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.560
on it and brings you to the code that I use. Usually again, I'll sort of miniature version

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.960
of the code, miniature version of the data set that you can then see the visualization there

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.920
in, in your browser. Nice. Yeah. Cause you've got a basic, I think,

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.440
encode the data and the URL or something. So it can't be too much.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:17.040
Right. So I would like basically take the data in the data frame, turn it into a Python dictionary,

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:22.480
and then like set it up because it won't work with files for security reasons. So assign that

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.040
dictionary to a variable or no, no, I'm sorry. I turned to CSV in a string and then assign that

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.400
string to a variable and read it in. And then I would see if it overflowed the pandas work,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.760
not pandas, a tutor limit. And if it did that sort of iterated until I got it small enough to fit in

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.160
there and big enough to be useful and interesting. I'll take a few iterations.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.640
It's cool. No, but it's a super, super good resource for learning pandas. I also think

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.800
for exploring, right? Like you end up with some code that like, I'm not really sure what this

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.480
does, or this is actually new to me. Like a lot of the things you might encounter in this book,

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.760
you're like, let me visualize that. Right. Cause yeah, it's great.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:03.120
Right. I mean, I, as I said, like I do a lot of training in pandas and very often people

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.680
have already played with it a bit, used it, even use it for a year or two. And because it's so

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:13.040
large, like it's not unusual for someone to say, Oh, I had no idea that this functionality existed.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:19.040
Why have I been wasting my time doing X and Y and Z? I'll give you one, one example that I've

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.440
been using more and more. So, you know, Matt Harrison's a big fan of the method chaining

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.200
approach. And at first I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, Matt, whatever. Like, like, yo,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.200
stop pushing out on everyone. That's your point. Keep them to yourself.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:37.280
Right. And then I was like, actually, this is a great way to build things up little by little,

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.800
line by line. And I can use this. It's pedagogically very useful because I say,

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.560
okay, let's think about how we want to break down this problem. We'll do this. Then we'll do this.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.880
Then we'll do this. And you can see it sort of going line by line until voila, we have the

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:54.960
analysis that we want. And so I inserted that into a lot of places in the book. Sort of like

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.040
one of the last edits that I did was to go back and change it to be more method chaining. And I

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:05.920
use it now all the time in my training and in Bamboo Weekly. And I, so I, I, I bow to Matt on

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.000
that. He was, he was right. And I was stubbornly resistant for no good reason.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.240
Yeah. I really like that style as well. You see, it's officially night here where I am.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.920
It's just, everything switched to dark.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.720
But I just had that yesterday when it, like I was doing office hours and all of a sudden,

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.800
like I was sharing my screen and it changed the color. I'm glad I'm not the only one.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:30.720
So yeah, I, I'm a big fan of the method chaining fluent interfaces. I mean, I would love to even

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.280
see like I thought on itself in the standard library, adopt that more, right? Like there's

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.160
so many things you operate on that'll change something, but then it'll, it'll return.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.440
No, it'll not return anything. It's like a void method as much as we have those,

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:48.800
right? It returns none effectively. So you can't say, you know, dot sort dot this dot that you have

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.920
to like multi-step it. And I would just love to see more of it, but let's talk.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:58.480
Well, I'll just, I'll just say there on that front. So CanDoes like does have the option to

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.840
either get back a new data frame or to say in place equals true. And then it does it locally,

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.400
like it does it on that data structure and then returns none. And people are consistently

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:13.440
convinced that this is faster, more efficient, better. And so I've been like trying to tell

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:18.800
people, no, the Python core developers keep saying, do not think that is true. It is not true.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.280
And we are getting rid of in place equals true at some point, stop using it so that you can do

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:28.960
method chaining. And so no small number of people again, in my course, they're like, Oh, really? I

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.600
had no idea. I feel like, you know, I'm spreading the gospel.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.400
Throw that whole expression in some parentheses and dot yourself away. Let's go. All right.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.760
That's right.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:46.880
Let's dot our way on over to exercise seven of the many, and let's just talk about long,

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.360
medium and short taxi rides. Tell us like, kind of like we can only talk so much about the code,

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.160
but like, let's, let's talk a bit about it and get people, like I said, I want to expose people to

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.400
like, what are some of the problems and aspects of Pandas that you can use to solve them?

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:07.760
Sure. So one of my favorite datasets to work with is a New York city taxi information. It's like,

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.640
everyone can identify with it. You understand it. And so this exercise uses a very small

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.640
subset of that. Maybe we'll talk next about the pandemic taxis, which is a much larger one,

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.960
but this is just a hundred thousand, no, 10,000, 10,000 taxi rides from like five years ago,

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:27.360
six years ago. And the question is, well, how can we divide up this dataset, which tells us

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.840
how long, how far, how much people paid when they were picked up all that information.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:37.600
How can we find out like the distance that they went and categorize that? And the reason that

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.800
this can be useful is we so often have numeric data that we need to put into categories, right?

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.520
What are best sellers? What are poor sellers who are, you know, the most, you know, you know,

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.600
employee of the year, that sort of thing. There's so many places where turning something into a

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.560
category will be useful. And so it's very tempting to think, okay, I'll like do some

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:02.240
if statements or I'll do some for statements, but actually pandas provides us with PD.cut,

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:07.600
which just does it for us. And this is one of those examples of once you learn it, you're like,

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.560
oh, wow, I get it. I don't have to have, oh yeah, even up here. Like you might think you would want

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:18.000
to say, let's set all the categories, you know, to be medium. And then where it's less than two

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.240
miles, we'll call it short or it's greater than 10 miles. We'll call it long, but you can just

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.960
say PD.cut, we're going to cut it to, we're going to cut it 10. Anything less than two is short.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.920
Anything greater than 10 is long. Anything in the middle is medium. Done. PD.cut gives you back a

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:37.680
new series. - This portion of Talk Python to me is brought to you by Scalable Path. If you're a

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:43.280
founder or engineering leader, you know how hard it is to find top tier developers while keeping

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.480
costs low. That's where Scalable Path comes in. They're a software staffing company that helps

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:54.320
you build remote dev teams that just fit. If you're wondering what sets this staffing company apart,

00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:00.640
well, one big differentiator is their approach. They're founded and run by developers. Scalable

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:06.480
Path understands that finding the right developer is not just about technical skills. It's about

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.840
personality, work ethic, and how well they mesh with your team. They are software architects,

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.800
will take the time to understand your vision and needs, and then develop technical challenges for

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:22.400
the roles you're looking to hire. And these technical tests are conducted live on video by

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.520
senior software developers, so there's no gaming the system. And Scalable Path takes it one step

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:33.120
further. They evaluate each developer's soft skills like communication, attitude, and work style

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:40.480
before presenting best suited candidates to you. Scalable Path has built a network of over 35,000

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.200
remote developers. No more endless searches or sleepless nights worrying about the right hire.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:52.000
And here's a special offer for Talk Python listeners. You'll get 20% off of your first month.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.240
So are you ready to scale your dev team and your business? Get started by visiting

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:01.440
talkpython.fm/scalablepath. The link is in your podcast player's show notes.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.400
Thank you to Scalable Path for supporting the show.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.520
So the way you're doing is you're setting everything to medium, and then you're defining

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.360
short and you're defining long instead of defining the three categories.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:18.080
So that's like the sort of, you might think this would be a good way to do it.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.680
And it works, right? As I like to say in my courses, unfortunately this works.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:27.600
Right? Like, so you will get the right answer this way. But if you then like pay,

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.320
go to the next page here, you'll see that you can just use PD cut.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.780
I see.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:36.640
Yeah. And then you just say, here are the bins. Here are the labels. Go.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.400
Well, this goes back to that thing we talked about, like looping over stuff versus just going,

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.440
this is what I want you to do. Do it a hundred percent deep down inside the best you can.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.360
Don't bother me. Just figure it out for me.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:55.520
That's exactly right. And this means that like a whole lot of people have worked on PD cut

00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.000
and have made it work efficiently, way more efficiently than you or I could do in our code.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.120
Presumably, right? It's not going to be any worse. And it'll probably be a lot better.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.760
The other thing is you get back and you can see it's sorted at the end.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.400
What the output of the series you get here. So you feed it a series and you get back a series,

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.320
but then the series looks at first glance, like it's a bunch of strings.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.480
And so you're going to have short or short, medium, medium, long, long, long,

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.200
but it's actually not strings. It's actually a category, which is a Panda's version of an enum.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.040
So really it's very small because it's just integers being stored there.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.040
And then those integers are associated with strings. So that's an example of like where

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.240
they have thought through it. And they've basically said, yeah, we're going to make

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.640
this more efficient than you would probably think to do on your own.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.120
Right. Awesome. Well, I would, to be honest, I've been happy if I came up with that first solution.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.480
Just using lock and set it in there. That's pretty cool. But this cuts is super nice.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.240
Yeah. Just define the boundaries as bins and then off it goes.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:57.040
Right. Right. And there's an option there include lowest. And so I actually didn't

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.640
know about this for a while. So I'd be like, okay, so think about the bins has to be from

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:05.520
some small number to some large number. And the question is then, well, wait a second.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.600
What about that leftmost bin? What about that? Like if it's up to and not including,

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.840
it's like less than, but not less than equal, then how do I do it? So I will always be like,

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:18.880
well, I'll take the min. I'll do like the series dot min minus one. And then it's guaranteed to

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.800
be lower than that. But no, it turns out the Panda's developers thought about this long before

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.200
I did. And there's an option, a keyword argument you can pass include lowest equals true done.

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.680
Now it's less than an equal as opposed to just less than.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.080
Right. Because all these kinds of things, the boundary conditions are always tricky,

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.280
especially on floating points, right? Oh yes. Oh yes.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.440
There's probably at least two spacecrafts that have crashed because of this. All right.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:47.520
The next one we want to go to is number 12, finding outliers.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.640
Yeah. So, you know, it's, this is not a book about statistics and I'm not an expert in

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:58.160
statistics, but there are a whole lot of statistical ideas that permeate working with

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:03.760
Pandas. And so it's like, you know, mean standard deviation, median understanding sort of how they

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.640
can differ from one another. Right. And especially the whole mean versus median thing where it's so

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:14.400
easy to have a few outliers, pull your data up or pull your data down and then sort of fool you.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.880
Right. And so often people want to find the opposite. And I've certainly found this,

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.720
especially with our corporate training with like a cybersecurity people where they're like,

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.560
we are always looking for outliers. Like, you know, who was the user who was logging in at

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:31.440
unusual times? Who logged in for 20 IP addresses within one minute.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.800
That's right. That's not a good person. They're not good. I'm telling you that right now.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:44.800
They just try to be very, very effective. And so, and so, so this finding outliers is, okay,

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:51.360
let's find out them, not who was sort of normal, but like who was abnormal, right? Who, who was

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:58.080
exhibiting, you know, unusual behavior. And so here it's like, okay, let's take our set of numbers

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.920
and let's find out who was more than one standard deviation. It's one or two above the mean or

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:09.760
below the mean. And let's just find those values and ignore the sort of normal values. And then

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.920
we could talk a little about, you know, IQR, the inter quartile range, which is a standard

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.080
statistical idea that we don't talk about enough, even though it's super useful, right? People came

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.480
up with these ideas a long time ago. Oh, here's a fun fact. John Tukey, who came up with a lot of

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:29.520
these ideas, he also invented the word bit in computers. So yeah, I was like, wow, what a guy.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.800
So you can see here then that like, I'm going to take the, you know, trip distance, let's find,

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.680
you know, trip distance. Let's find where the trip distance is less than the trip distance

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:46.800
at the first, the first quartile minus one half times the IQR, right? Meaning let's take the

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.600
distance between the first quartile and the third quartile. That's our inter quartile range. That

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.320
gives us a sense of like, where is the bulk, where the bulk of the numbers, and let's find out who

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:02.240
is below that or who's above that. And so it's not surprising if we're looking for taxi distances,

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.440
you're not going to have a lot of outliers that are very low because you can't go below zero miles

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:14.080
in your taxi, but you can go very high. You can go very large. And so looking for those trips that

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:20.000
are greater than the 75th percentile plus one and a half times the IQR, we actually find, you know,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.360
I see here, I found me, you know, about 1800 taxi rides out of the 10,000. So about 19% of the taxi

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:30.960
rides are much, much longer than the mean ride. And you can use this, then you can imagine people

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:37.360
in like the New York City Taxi Limousine Commission saying, oh, we can use this to plan to charge to,

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.440
you know, send taxis at different places. - Sure, have a special program for long distance

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.560
stuff or whatever. Yeah. - Right. Right. Or if you're Uber,

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.800
you know where to place, they actually used to have the geog, the longitude and latitude of where

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.960
people were picked up and dropped off and they got rid of that. And I'm sure both for privacy

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.760
reasons and because Uber and Lyft can look at that data and say, oh, well, we know now when to send

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:04.480
cars where. - Well, although while true, I imagine that that data has been downloaded and archived

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:09.920
with geolocation for certain people, right? - Oh yeah, you can still get all that old data.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.480
It's just the newer stuff that they don't do. And they still do it by neighborhood.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.120
- I see. - I also wonder like how precise that

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:19.840
longitude and latitude was, like you would probably identify which home like was going to which other

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.560
home. - Yeah, now you're getting into a problem.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.120
- I can only imagine how bad that would look. - Yeah, now you're getting into a shady spot or

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:31.120
certain types of establishments, you know, that could be brought with consequences for the people

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.320
whose home you've already identified where they were picked up at or all sorts of stuff, right?

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.680
- Exactly. - All right, fair.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.600
- Exactly. - Fair. That's way more important

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.960
than whether Uber can place their vehicles strategically, you know?

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.080
- Right. Right. And they might have some data on their own too, you know.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:50.880
- Nice. Okay, so you can use this IQR, interquartile range feature to pull that out here,

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.560
right? - Right. Right. And, you know,

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.400
we can pull that out and then do simple multiplication. Right at the end of the day,

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.360
what we're doing is we're pulling out this data and then just doing very, very simple statistical

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.840
analysis of it. Just to sort of say, how many outliers do we have? How many low outliers? How

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:10.400
many high outliers? And you can see this, like at the end of the day, it's not that complicated in

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.000
terms of math. Sometimes people are like, "Well, how much math do I have to know to learn this

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.640
stuff?" I'm like, "I can get through it. I promise you. Not that much. It's not that hard. A few

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.480
basic ideas and you're basically set." - Yeah, very cool. All right, onto the next

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.640
one, which is endemic taxis. That's a different kind of taxi.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:33.280
- So this was actually, so the two or so that we looked at so far were with my tiny little

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:40.800
10,000 taxi ride sample from a few years ago. I then took taxi rides from January and July of

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.920
2019 and 2020. So four months there. And the question was, I think I actually only looked at

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:52.320
July in this exercise. Yeah, July, 2019, July, 2020, comparing taxi rides. Now, just to remind

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:58.720
you, July, 2020, not a great time for tourism in New York City or anywhere else. And so the

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:07.920
question was, what differences do we see between July, 2019 and July, 2020? How much did it go down

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.560
in terms of taxi use? How much less did people pay? And then my favorite part of this was,

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:20.480
did people use cash more in 2020 or less in 2020? And so you see, first of all, it's like a decline

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:26.320
of some like 80% in terms of taxi rides from 2019 to 2020. Again, not a huge surprise to anyone who

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.600
lived through the pandemic and saw what was going on then. And so my gut feeling was, well, no one

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:36.160
wanted to touch anyone else or touch anything that anyone else had touched. So clearly people would

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.360
have used credit cards much more. And no, it turns out-

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.960
There's that screen, Reuven. You got to touch the okay. That drove me crazy during the pandemic.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.040
It's like, I'm going to just do touchless. And then you sign it or you okay. You're like,

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:57.440
I never thought of that. I guess in Israel, you just do the tapping of your car. You didn't have

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.320
to sign anything, but huh. Yeah. The US, they're like, oh,

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.120
hit okay to confirm. It's like, okay. I thought we had just escaped me touching this disease-ridden

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.600
thing, but no. Also, you have to indicate how much of a tip you want to leave, but that's a

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:15.120
whole separate thing. Yeah. We're at the car wash. Don't you want to tip the car? No, I don't want

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:19.360
to tip the car wash. That's the other thing is you should have looked at tips. That could have

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:24.640
been interesting actually as well. I think, no, I think I did. I definitely looked at tips,

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.520
but I can't remember what it was like- Like around the pandemic. Yeah. Because I know a lot

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.840
of people gave tips to say thanks. And I was wondering if that would show up. Thanks for being

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:37.440
out here amongst the diseased ones. So it turns out that people used cash more

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.960
during the pandemic than credit. And I raised this with my family. I was like, what the heck?

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:48.320
I think it was my sister who said, well, everyone who would use, the people who were higher income

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:53.360
earners who use their credit cards more, they were staying home. It's the people who were forced to

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:57.120
go to work who use cash more, who were taking the taxis because they didn't want to take the subway.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:03.280
Like there was sort of an in-between sort of thing. So you get all these wild pieces of data

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:08.960
and analysis that you can do. And here it was not just pulling out all this data, but one of the big

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:14.160
things was also, I want to read in a lot of data. I want to read in from two different CSV files.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.800
Now what do I do? Because it's very obvious. You read in a CSV file, you get a data frame. You read

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.040
another CSV file, you get a day frame. But I want to treat those as one. And I want to then be able

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:28.160
to distinguish between them. How do I do that? And so sure enough, Pandas has a concat method.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:35.280
And I use concat now all the time. I read in multiple CSV files into multiple data frames.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.720
I can cat them together and you can get at them either horizontally or vertically, depending on

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:43.200
what you like, what you want to do. And- I see. If they're like, their columns are the same,

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:48.400
then you might do it vertically. But if you want to augment it potentially, because now we have the

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.640
sale percentage data, but it goes along with the columns exactly, or the rows exactly.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:43:00.160
Precisely. Precisely. And so another nice way to do this also is not just read this one and read

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:06.560
that one, but you can use a list comprehension with something like glob. So glob.glob on star.csv,

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:12.080
get back a list of data frames and then just hand that to pd.concat. And so that's where

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.160
knowing Python and be able to pull that out and use those techniques can really, really come in

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.160
handy. Yeah. Earlier you mentioned, I want to go back to it real quick. You mentioned that learn

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:25.280
Python first and then Pandas. A lot of times when I think learn Python, I think, okay, well,

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:31.840
learn the language and then learn the standard library to a good degree, and then begin to chop

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:37.360
away at the half million things on PyPI that are interesting. And it's like a never ending sort of

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.520
thing. And then there's of course, this joke, like I learned Python, it was a good weekend or

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.520
something like that. Right? Like, how do you square these two things? But I feel like the

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:50.400
amount of Python that you need to learn is mostly centered around the language and really is

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.280
actually not that much. And then you kind of learn the Pandas way, right? Theoretically,

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:00.480
if you wanted to. Right. Right. For sure. Look, I am a big fan of objects and classes and all

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:07.200
that stuff. But when I'm talking to people who specifically want to use Python for data analytics

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:12.400
with Pandas, I say to them, objects will help you, but they're not going to be crucial. Like

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:16.400
if there's a part of the course that you want to sort of drop, save some money, save some time,

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:21.680
then that's a place where we can save because the odds of an analyst using Pandas writing their own

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:27.120
classes are pretty slim. I feel give them some perspective on how these classes work. Sure. But

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:31.920
I don't think that like they need to learn that. So and like a lot of the standard library there,

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:36.000
it's hard to say. Right. So as I said, I love glob, right? Globbing is fantastic.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.600
But that's definitely not in like my intro class. I would say, oh, by the way. Yeah. I would bet

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:47.360
there's probably 10 modules that if you knew, you might not need to learn more for six months,

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:52.640
you know, doing Jupyter Pandas type of work, right? Like pathlib and a couple of things like

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.680
that. Right. That's right. That's right. I mean, I just made up that number. Yeah. It's mostly like

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.760
just being able to sort of work with the core data structures, understanding the syntax and how it

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.640
works and even like defining some simple functions. Right. I think most people using Pandas

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:11.920
are not at the end going to define functions, although as I've gone on with my use of Pandas,

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:17.040
I see, you know, Lambda, this is where it's at. Like knowing how to use it really, really helps.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.040
So there I do sort of go back with the Pandas people. I'm like, OK, this is going to be super

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:26.240
weird. We're going to talk about anonymous functions now. And then and then like I typically

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.160
do that with a more advanced part of Pandas groups, not with the like introductory ones.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.880
But if you can sort of wrap your mind around that, then it does help quite a bit. It does.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:39.680
So it takes what would be multiple step things and lets you turn it into one of those chained

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.440
expressions because instead of defining a function somewhere else, you can just put it in line as

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.320
part of a Lambda and just keep on going, you know. Great. That's right. And the fact that so it's

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:52.720
especially useful, I find so we mentioned dot lock earlier. So dot lock allows you to choose

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:59.840
rows. Start with that. And so I can pass it a Lambda and that Lambda then gets the data frame

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:05.200
you're working on as an argument. And then whatever it returns, if it returns a Boolean

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:10.240
series, then it allows you to filter. Well, you can then have multiple dot locks and multiple

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:15.600
Lambdas in a row to do successive filtering. And yes, that is less efficient than doing it all in

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:20.400
one fell swoop. But boy, oh boy, it's easier to think about. It's easier to use. So you just like

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.440
whittle it down, whittle it down, whittle it down each line with its own Lambda. And so understanding

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.240
how to do that, understanding why it's important that the Lambda inside the Lambda using the

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.920
temporary parameter from the Lambda as opposed to the overall variable for your data frame,

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:41.280
because you're chaining it, that's useful as well. Well, 100%, then you can also like comment out

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.960
certain lines at the end and see what the intermediate values are. And so you say it's

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.200
less efficient. It's less computationally efficient. It might be more efficient as a

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:54.640
human being trying to understand what the heck is happening, right? That is spot on. I like,

00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:00.400
I often tell people that I think Python is a language for an age in which computers are cheap

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:07.840
and people are expensive. Because like, right, our efficiency is the big bottleneck in terms of time,

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.840
in terms of money. So right, if it takes my computer a few seconds more, who the heck cares?

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:16.480
Right. My M2 pro doesn't care if it's like a tiny bit more, I don't care.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.240
That's right. That's right.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.960
Or my cluster of GPUs, take your pick. Although at that point it starts to cost real money to

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.480
burn those things, you know? Right. But still, I mean, depending, look,

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:31.360
if you see that your computation is taking a long time, okay, so then you sort of find that and you

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.280
improve that. Yeah. That's a really good point. Like a lot of things are, don't worry about that

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:38.880
until it's actually going to become a problem. It looks slow. It turns out it's probably a blink

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:44.320
of an eye. All right. Let's keep moving on. We're getting short on time and we have a plethora of

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:50.640
things to work with. I kind of want to go to wine words. Wine words. Wine words. All right.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.080
Let me remember what exercise that is. That is 37. All right.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:48:00.320
Yeah. So people think of pandas, not wrongly, as being great at working with numbers,

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:07.200
but it turns out that it's fantastic at working with two other kinds of data types. One is strings

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:13.440
and one is dates and time. And you can get a ton, a ton out of analysis working with these if you

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:19.280
know how to work with it. So there is, I forget where it is, like there's a machine learning,

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:28.560
like archive of data sets. And one of them is 150,000 wine reviews from Wine Magazine.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.600
Oh, wow. Is it Kaggle maybe or is it somewhere else?

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.360
I think Kaggle has a version of it, but I think it's elsewhere.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.280
Wine Mag, 150,000 reviews. Okay. Beautiful.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.040
I don't know. I'll find out where it is. Anyway.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:41.440
No worries.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:47.840
So I said, okay, let's find out. Because you drink a bottle of wine and you read the back

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.840
and you sort of like, you know, roll your eyes at what they've written. Although I'll put in a plug,

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:57.520
I read this fantastic book a few years ago called Cork Dork by this journalist who decided to become

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:03.040
a Somalier and she took the exam and her journey toward there, she convinced me these words actually

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:07.200
have real meaning and people are very serious about it. So I will not roll my eyes quite as

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:07.840
much anymore.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.160
I'm getting hints of nutmeg, but they're troubling.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.560
Yes. Yes.

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.360
They don't belong.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:19.280
So the question was, okay, what about these reviews of wine? What words are people using?

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:24.080
And are they using certain words more with California wines and certain words more with

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:30.560
French wines or certain words more with red or with white or rosé? And so we can then take this

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.520
text, break it apart and search for it. We can search for it using plain old Panda stuff. We can

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.040
search for it using regular expressions, which it has built in and works very well.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:47.360
So here, so let's see some analysis on the words. So one of the 10 most common words for red wine.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:51.440
Right. So how do we do that? Well, we have to take the description and break it apart.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:55.040
And if you're used to using just plain old Python, you're like, oh, well, I guess I'll

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:59.840
break that into a list. But now what? Now I have a series of lists. Now what do I do?

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:05.440
And so one of the key methods to know here is something called explode. And explode is

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:12.000
let's take a series of lists and turn that into a very, very, very long series. And so basically

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.640
each element in the list becomes an element in the series and they all share an index. So you

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.520
know where they're originally from and then you know the world's your oyster. So you can get rid

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:26.560
of punctuation. Right. So I have a S dot stir lower. Okay. So we lowercase everything. Then

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:31.280
that stir split and we split into a list. Then we say explode, get into a long series. Then we once

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:37.600
again, run strip, get rid of punctuation. And now we can use is in, which is yet another fantastic

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:43.920
pandas method to say, are these words in like find the lines where these words are located.

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:48.240
And then we can just do a value counts. Definitely my favorite method. How often does this thing show

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.600
up? And then we use head. Ta-da. We've got the 10 most common, 10 most common words there.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.760
Cause the most common, the counts, the value counts, sorts probably most,

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.120
most common to least common, right? Yeah, yeah, exactly. So value counts,

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.920
not only does it count how often something shows up, but exactly. It sorts it from most common to

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.400
least common. So then head, yeah. If you want, yeah. However much you take there and then that's,

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.080
that's the one. So those are the popular ones. That's right. That's right. So here I have like,

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:18.320
you know, the page we're looking at. So we get find where the country is France. So that's

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.400
the row selector and we want the console to be description. So we only want the description.

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.400
And then we have our function top 10 words, which did what I just described. We're going to take

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:30.320
these common wine words, lowercase, then get rid of the punctuation, so forth, pass it in. And we

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:35.360
get back our top words and we find out what words are used to, you know, are associated with French

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:40.640
wines as opposed to California wines and so on and so forth. Excellent. Yeah. Very, very cool example.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.360
All right. We, I think we've got time for two more to go through. You want to pick two that

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:53.440
are popular or do you want to leave it? let's see. Let's see. Let's do, maybe 32

00:51:53.440 --> 00:52:01.760
multi-city. Actually. Yeah. Multi best tippers. Yeah. You mentioned, Oh, you're going to open up

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:07.280
a whole, this is going to be a whole thing. Best tippers. Number 42. Let's go. No, no, no judgment

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.600
here, folks. All right. So the question is like, so we'll try to understand as I read here,

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.840
when people tip their taxi drivers more generously. All right. So the question was,

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:21.840
did they tip better? And we looked at 2019 before the pandemic in January and July. So do they tip

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:26.480
more in the winter or do they tip more in the summer? And so this involves several things.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:31.440
First of all, it involved using dates and time. Again, one of these things that pandas is just

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:37.200
amazing at that people are not aware of all the flexibility you have there. Another thing is how

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:41.600
easy it is to create a new column, right? So we spoke before a bit, how you can use broadcasting

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:46.560
to just multiply. I have a column multiplied by something or a column adding to another column,

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.920
but you can create a new column just by assigning to it. Again, it's sort of like assigning to a

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:54.720
dictionary. It just then is there. And so you can calculate the percentage that people tip,

00:52:54.720 --> 00:53:00.800
put that in a new column and then say, well, let's now group by the month and let's find out.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.360
- Take the mean or the max or some sort of deviation.

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:09.520
- Exactly. Exactly. And we can find out like, you know, whether people tip more on average

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:17.280
in January or in July. I honestly don't remember what the answer is, which will hopefully not tick

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:22.640
off too many readers. Here we go. Let's see what it says. Oh, here we go. Go back one page there.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:27.920
So 32% of taxi riders in New York don't tip at all. That's right. That was a surprising thing to me.

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.200
And then I don't remember exactly what it was for month.

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:35.200
- And you know, you're talking summer versus winter. There's probably a tourism

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:39.600
angle versus non locals versus tourists. I mean, I know people go to New York and

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.600
not in the summer, but not as much, I imagine.

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:46.720
- That's right. That's right. There are all these different factors that like, you know, come into

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.920
it. - Yeah. One of the things, kind of takeaways I'm feeling as we were talking about all these

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.320
is like, there's a lot of interesting questions that can be asked and answered really quickly

00:53:54.320 --> 00:54:00.560
for like sociology and urban planning and all kinds of interesting questions that don't feel

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:05.920
like programmer questions. - Yes. So, you know, I mean, I talked to a lot of people, you probably

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:11.520
do too, who are like interested in advancing their careers with Python and they're like, well, you

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:16.080
know, I don't have a computer science background. Can I get a job as a programmer? And their vision

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.720
of a programmer is either someone working at a startup or at like one of the big companies,

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:26.000
Google, Amazon, Facebook, and so forth. I say to them, look, there are an awful lot of people who

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:33.200
have great jobs working at supermarket chains and insurance companies in the backroom analyzing data

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.320
and they are crucial, but we don't think of them as programmers and in governments and in cities

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:43.280
and weather forecasting, like everyone nowadays is using data and collecting and analyzing it

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:49.840
and having these skills either gives you abilities to do your job better or gives you the ability to

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:54.400
move into a new job that you couldn't have done before that these places are desperately looking

00:54:54.400 --> 00:55:00.000
to fill. - Yeah, I totally agree. I can't remember which episode it was. I didn't name it right. So

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.440
there's an episode I did quite a while ago about our programmers and our data scientists and Python

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.800
data scientists working together. And I think it was the research arm of Kroger maybe that had like

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:17.600
200 data scientists. - Wow. - That's a proper group of data scientists. I mean, a lot of times data

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:21.360
scientists, I feel like there's a couple of them for a company compared to a software team or

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:27.280
something. - No, and I tell people also, it's worth learning to write and it's worth learning to

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.680
speak, not because you're going to be like a Pulitzer prize winning writer, not because you're

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:36.000
going to be like whatever prize you would get for like speaking well, just because having these

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.720
skills makes you more effective at your job. And people who can write a program to suck up some

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:45.360
data, analyze it and come back with a result, especially if it's like a public data set that

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:50.800
has something to do with what they're working on, they are so much more valuable to their company

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:55.600
than they would have been otherwise. - Oh yeah, absolutely. So I found it because I have a search

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.840
engine on Talk Python that searches the transcripts and everything else. So if you want to know

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:04.000
something people about historical shows, when you hit search, it's not just like the show notes.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:12.880
So scaling data science across Python and R episode 236 with Ethan Swan, Bradley, Bokeme,

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:18.480
and the company is 84.51 degrees. So anyway, that's- - Oh, I've seen that before.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.120
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what it was. So people can check that out if they're

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.640
interested, but- - Very, very cool.

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.760
- Yeah, super cool. Okay, last one. What are we doing?

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.280
- Let's do cities. - Cities. What number is it?

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.200
- So 43. - Okay, oh, that's right.

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:38.800
- So I found a few years ago this JSON file containing the thousand largest cities in the

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:44.080
United States. So first of all, good to work with JSON because people need to know how to work with

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:50.400
that kind of data. Second of all, okay, let's not look at the numbers so much as let's do some

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:57.360
plotting. And so I'm going to make enemies now. I really cannot handle matplotlib. I find it,

00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:02.960
it's like so incredibly powerful. And anytime I want to do even the tiniest thing with it,

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.800
I have to look up the documentation and remind myself how it works. Maybe it's because I don't

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:12.560
use it enough. And so I just use the pandas interface for plotting 95% of the time. Let's

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:17.200
call it 90% of the time. The rest of the time I usually use Seaborn. So I said, okay, let's see

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:22.640
if we can do some plotting here of these largest cities. So for example, let's see growth in

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:27.280
Pennsylvania cities, like which cities in Pennsylvania, oh, I'm sorry, like let's see a dual

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.840
bar plot. How many large cities are in each state? Okay, well, that's a group by, right? So you have

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:35.680
to know how to do grouping. You have to know what you're grouping on and how to use count as opposed

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.480
to mean, right? That can't even exist. But then if I want to see a bar plot where it's sorted from

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.080
smallest to largest, you got to know how to do sorting. And then we can do a bar plot. So sure

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:50.720
enough, you do a dot plot dot bar on your series, kablam, you have a bar plot right there. And we

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:55.520
just get it in like, you know, it's nicely sorted there. Quick takeaways. Holy cow, does California

00:57:55.520 --> 00:58:00.720
have more big cities than I realized? And you know, where's New York and New Jersey? Like it's

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:06.320
way down the line. You think of those as having like pretty megatropolis type places. Massachusetts.

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:12.160
That's right. That's right. But it's how many cities, right? So, right, right, right. That's

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:17.120
like the fun. So keep going. So like do a bar plot of growth in Pennsylvania. So how are we going to

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:21.520
do that? Well, wait a second. If we want to do growth, it's a percentage, but it's written in

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:26.720
the JSON as number and then percent sign. That's a string. So we're going to have to get rid of the

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.760
percent sign. And then we're going to have to change the D type from string to a floating point.

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:38.400
And then we can sort it and then we can graph it. And so that's changing the D type basically is a

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:44.000
deep down inside of pandas parse as an integer operation, right? Rather than looping over and

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.480
parsing or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like basically, I mean, it has to do the looping.

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:53.280
It's doing the looping there at the below sea level. Yeah. Below sea level. Yeah. Down by the

00:58:53.280 --> 00:59:00.240
dead sea. I see. Okay. Got it. And so you see here like this bar plot. Now we have a whole bunch of

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.800
cities that have gone down in size and a bunch of things going up in size and pandas is very happy

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:12.800
to show the bar plot there again, sorted so that we see it from the greatest sort of shrinkage to

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:17.600
the greatest growth. Right. With Pittsburgh having the most shrinkage and Allentown having the most

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:21.920
growth. I would not guess that. I would not have either given that like my sister-in-law and

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:27.680
brother-in-law live in Allentown and they're like, "Oh, Allentown." But I think that's a common thing

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:31.280
that people think there, even though it seems like a perfectly great place to be. Yeah. Sure.

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:35.600
Funny. Awesome. Well, there's a lot of cool takeaways from this.

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.440
One more. Let me show you one. Go to the last one here in this exercise.

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.400
Okay. You got it.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:47.520
So one of the most important types of plots you can do in data analysis is a scatter plot. And

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:53.840
you take your data frame and you say, "Give me the plot with based on the X axis should be this,

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:58.320
the Y axis should be that." Well, if we do a scatter plot based on longitude and latitude

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.720
of the thousand largest US cities, you basically come up with a map of the US.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:07.120
Yeah. How interesting. The other thing that you realize is California is technically bigger than

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.160
a lot of other states. So that also counts for why. Oh, yes.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.280
Yeah. Interesting. But there's a lot of people in California. Good place to be.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.880
There are a lot of people there for sure.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.360
If they're willing to pay the sunshine tax, it's nice there.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:24.160
Cool. All right, Reuven. This is really, really excellent. I know you want to give a shout out to

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:29.040
a couple of exercises from Bamboo Weekly. So I'll include those in the show notes as well.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.720
People can pick those and jump over and look at them as well.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.320
That's fine. That's great. Yeah. We went through a lot here just during this time.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.440
Yeah, for sure. As I've discovered, there's basically,

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.760
I mean, there is an infinite number of these sorts of things that you can do and different

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:49.680
permutations of various sorts. I mean, we didn't even talk about multi-indexing, which opens up

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.200
literally a whole new dimension of this stuff. But it's great fun. It's pretty good fun.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.440
And a lot of the Pandas 2 stuff coming on changes the foundation and opens up more

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.040
possibilities still. Absolutely.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.680
All right. Well, final thoughts, final call to action. What do we got here? What do you say?

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:09.040
Well, call to action. I mean, you can take a look at my overall courses and so forth at

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:13.520
learnerpython.com. Or if you just want to improve your Pandas knowledge, you can look at bamboo

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:18.080
weekly.com, the newsletter there. Does it cost money or does it just cost an email?

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.360
So it is a paid newsletter, but the first two questions and answers every week are free.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:30.000
So it's usually between five and nine questions each week. But even if you don't pay,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.160
I still want people to get some Pandas learning improvement practice so they can totally do that.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.800
Excellent. All right. Yeah. And check out the book, obviously.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.400
Oh, yeah. That too. Pandasworkout.com. I'll pull this up.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.640
It's actually pretty thick.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.360
Yes, it is.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:52.560
At the end, I was like, "Oh, that's why it took a long time." Also procrastination.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:59.280
I'd love to hear from people if they have... I always love to hear interesting problems,

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.960
data sets, issues that people are experiencing just so I can figure out what are the next

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:08.480
directions for me to explore that I can then try to help people with as well.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.760
Awesome. Well, I appreciate all your help coming on the show,

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.160
sharing your knowledge, and just riffing on Pandas together. It was a lot of fun.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.440
Excellent. My great pleasure.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.320
Yeah. Bye.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.040
All right. Bye-bye.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Bye.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:25.760
