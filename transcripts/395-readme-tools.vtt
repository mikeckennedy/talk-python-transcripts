00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.820
If you maintain projects on places like GitHub, you know that having a classy readme is important

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.280
and that maintaining a changelog can be helpful for you and consumers of your project.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.320
It can also be a pain. That's why I'm excited to welcome Ned Batchelder to the show.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.260
He has a lot of tools to help here, as well as some opinions we're looking forward to hearing.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.080
We cover his tools and a bunch of others he and I found along the way.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.500
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 395, recorded Monday, December 5th, 2022.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:46.940

Ned, welcome back to Talk Python To Me.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.220
Hey, thanks for having me.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.000
This is always fun.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.400
Yeah.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.900
And it's always a good time to have you on the show.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.260
Got such interesting things to talk about.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.920
I think we've previously spoken about coverage.py, beginners and experts,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.280
and several other things probably if I go back through the old search engine.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.540
I've had many opinions about many things.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.880
Perfect.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.180
Well, we're looking forward to hearing your opinions on...

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.560
The title might suggest on the ReadMe,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.940
but I think maybe we've got to expand it to a couple other markdown files,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.560
maybe on a project as well to get the holistic picture.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.480
But basically, we're going to talk about tools and ideas and techniques

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.720
for making your project more accessible,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.220
feeling more polished and welcoming to people

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.960
when they land on your project on GitHub or GitLab or wherever.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.140
So that'll be fun.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.600
Yeah.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.260
It's an interesting topic too, because as a project maintainer,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.360
there's all this project level automation that goes on,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.280
and there are all these fascinating tools to get parts of it done

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.260
in different ways and competing philosophies.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.920
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.260
I know some of them because I fork different projects,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.220
and then I'll sync it or something,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.000
and it'll say that my automation couldn't run.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.920
I'm like, well, that wasn't my automation, but that's okay.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.220
It's fine if it runs or it doesn't run.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.660
I'm just here to follow.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.080
But before we get into all that,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.340
maybe let's just do a quick recap for those of you,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.140
those listeners out there who don't know you.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.860
Maybe what's the elevator pitch,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.880
and what have you been up to the last six months or so?

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.380
So I've been working in the Python world for a very long time.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.140
I don't know, 20 years now or something crazy like that.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.620
But my day job is at edX, which is part of 2U now,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.540
an education tech company.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.380
And I do open source logistics there.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.860
edX.org runs an open source software that we've created called Open edX,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.960
which also runs a couple of thousand other sites.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.420
And my main day job is making sure that that collaboration continues well

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.640
between the people inside 2U and the people out in the community.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.320
So it's an interesting dynamic of open source.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.380
But on the side, I also maintain a number of projects,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.760
including coverage.py, which has been going for 18 years now

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.600
and is used by a lot of people.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.720
So that's a whole other kind of open source that I do in the Python world.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.080
Yeah.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.740
That's a really rewarding job, right?

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.740
It's not optimizing ad clicks or other things like that, right?

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.840
It's helping people.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.200
Right.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.240
It's a noble goal.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.340
We're educating the world and we're giving away software to help other people educate the world.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.720
Yeah.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.560
It's really good.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.780
Yeah.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.300
Fantastic.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.340
And, you know, and speaking of open source projects,

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.180
I think we might touch on a couple more of yours as we get going.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.040
Yeah.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.640
They tend to multiply somehow.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.220
I haven't learned my lesson yet.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.620
Yeah.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.380
Just got these puppies running everywhere.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.260
I don't know what's going on.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.280
That's right.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.620
Exactly.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.200
They breed.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.420
I don't know when it happens.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.880
They breed.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.600
Exactly.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600
All right.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.880
Well, let's start off with one.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.700
I don't know if you're familiar with this.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.180
Readme.so.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.720
I don't know what the SO stands for, but I think of this as readme as a service.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.200
Interesting.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.660
Yeah.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.920
Or Stack Overflow.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.820
No, .so isn't Stack Overflow.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.320
I don't know.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.820
I don't know why they chose .so.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.400
I don't either.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.000
The woman who maintains it works at GitHub.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.940
I'm pretty sure.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.440
We're going to find out when I get to the bottom.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.580
But I don't think it has an association with Stack Overflow.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.240
Right.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.960
And usually two letters are country codes.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.880
I don't know what SO stands for.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.300
I don't either.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.760
As a country.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.060
Sorry, .so, folks.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.060
But this place, readme.so, it says, this is the easiest way to create a readme.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.040
Now, before we get into the details of this, maybe we should just talk about, you know,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.680
let me pull up coverage.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.540
Coverage.py on GitHub.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.580
Not to put you on the spot or anything.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.240
I don't mean to do that.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.740
But let's just talk about what kind of stuff should you put on your project.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.460
And like I said, we're going to have to expand a little bit.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.180
Like, for example, there's tags and there's a link and there's should you have releases

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.780
shown and other stuff that you might kind of think of what you get when you land on a project.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.780
So maybe start there with kind of how you think about what should be here.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.080
Then we'll talk about some of the tools.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.680
The first thing your readme should do is say what the project is.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.200
And that's sometimes difficult for people to wrap their head around.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.920
And it really gets at one of the fundamental problems of writing almost anything,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.180
which is you have to decide who you're writing for.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.660
And it's hard to know who might show up on your front page of your GitHub project.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.580
And you don't know what they already know.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.360
And so you don't know what you have to tell them.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.180
So it's a little bit tricky to get all that information out there.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.180
But for instance, under about here, it says the code coverage tool for Python,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.220
which was the sort of pithiest, shortest description I could come up with to say,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.420
what is coverage.py?

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.080
And I think that covers it pretty well.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.800
I don't try to explain what code coverage is,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.480
because that's a topic you can Google for if you don't know what it is.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.960
But so that covers it.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.880
If you don't know what it is and you don't know you want it,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.180
you might not care about this.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.940
So that's not your audience, right?

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.080
Right.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.860
Why are you here if you don't?

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.080
Right.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.560
Exactly.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.680
But go ahead and start on your way out the door, please.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.320
Thank you very much.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.340
Right.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.020
Exactly.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.520
Yeah.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.000
By the way, I could use a bunch more stars on coverage.py,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.160
because it's not a JavaScript project and it didn't start on GitHub.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.900
So it's a little low on stars.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.260
Yeah.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.500
But so, yeah, the read me.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.340
So I try to say what it is and then how to get started on it.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.120
And I think those might be the front top two things.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.080
I've got a thing there about Ukraine and badges,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.120
which we're going to get to.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.800
But it's sort of there's the first paragraph there,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.660
coverage.py measures, code coverage,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.720
typically during text execution.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.220
So it tries to give sort of a little bit deeper explanation of it,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.960
what you can run it on, and then getting started.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.940
There's a for enterprise thing there that links off to Tidelift.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.720
But then the getting started tries to be very quick about,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.960
you just want to try it.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.780
Here's some commands you can run to see how it works for you.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.640
Because a lot of people, they just want to get going.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.520
And if you can give them a quick instruction,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.940
then they'll be really happy.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.140
Yeah.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.080
Often four or five lines of code.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.540
Here's how you use my thing.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.740
Do I put a decorator onto a function and it does caching?

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.400
Do I await a database call?

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.820
Or like, what am I doing with this thing?

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.000
Right?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.780
You don't have to be super complicated.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.220
Right.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.680
And sometimes it's not even clear.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.240
Some people forget to mention,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.000
is this thing an application or is it a library?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.560
Like just the big picture.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.860
Like as a developer, you can be so, you know,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.400
in the trenches with your code.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.060
You forget.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.600
People don't know what it is yet.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.060
Like what shape it takes.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.400
Now, my readme is pretty short.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.720
And actually the getting started doesn't show the commands.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.060
It links to the getting start,

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.600
the quick start section of the docs.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.380
And the change history links to a separate part of the docs.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.120
So it's actually a pretty short readme.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.700
Some readmes can be very long, a little overwhelming.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.760
You have to scroll past all the getting started to get to the change history.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.200
For instance, I decided to take a different approach,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.220
which was to make it almost like a table of contents

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.460
to the places you might want to start in the larger docs.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.280
That is a decision you have to make, right?

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.440
Do you try to put enough in there that it's basically standalone in a sense?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:42.780
Or do you encourage folks to find their way over to a much more holistic sort of place, right?

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.800
That's an information architecture problem.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.800
You know, the thing about writing a good readme is it's documentation.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.740
And documentation has challenges all of its own

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.980
that most developers haven't been trained in formally.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.580
It's not really their first interest.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.340
It involves thinking about other people,

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.280
which let's just say some developers aren't skilled at.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.940
But also the curse of knowledge, right?

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.620
Once you know what code coverage is,

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.180
you don't feel the need to explain it or set the state.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.400
You're just like, well, we want code coverage.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.040
Of course you do.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.100
And here's the tool, you know, for example.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.540
Yeah.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.660
So it's hard to decide what words to put in there,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.080
how much to say, how to organize it.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.260
Those are all real challenges.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.600
Well, it's quite popular with 7.5 million downloads a week.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.660
Is that what it's up to?

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.420
Yeah, that's crazy.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.600
That's what it says, right?

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.280
That's kind of insane, right?

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.420
And it supports all the versions of Python, even the fast one.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.800
So that's cool.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.700
Well, it's interesting.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.620
So this is a point we might get to later.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.200
So you're looking at the Python versions it supports on the badge.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:39.720
Yes.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.480
But if you actually read the text, it's actually mentioned,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.540
which goes up, the badge goes up to 3.11.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.100
The text says it goes up to 3.12.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.020
The alpha, yeah.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:48.760
Alpha 2.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.640
And that's because of how the badges work.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.620
And there's reasons why people don't like badges because of that.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.720
But badges look cool.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.540
So you want the badges in.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:03.740
What's going on here is that the badges show the status of the latest release on PyPI.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.380
And so they're not in sync with what's in the repo.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.260
And it's kind of a challenge to figure out what you want to do about that, unfortunately.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.560
I do see, though, that you are a believer of badges.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.200
You know, I kind of got into badges.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.020
There's, what do we got on the screen here?

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.000
Six rows of badges, which honestly is a bit much.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.560
And I should probably, I mean, it's just kind of a mosaic of green and blue at this point.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.080
And it's kind of hard to get real.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.980
But I'm kind of excited to see that you have a Mastodon badge.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.140
The newest one.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.140
I put a Mastodon badge on there, exactly.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.200
Because that's the new crisis is moving from Twitter to Mastodon.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.540
So I'm finding Mastodon to be a really nice place.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.360
I mean, sort of sidebar for a second.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.840
How are you thinking about this whole Twitter, Mastodon, open source community on social media thing?

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.500
Yeah, I'm looking at it as an opportunity to try out Mastodon.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:59.220
And the thing that's really struck me about Mastodon is how many names of bloggers from 20 years ago I'm seeing again on Mastodon that I had lost track of.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.920
And thinking like, oh yeah, I used to read that guy's blog 20 years ago.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.680
And now we're connected on Mastodon.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:11.960
And so we're kind of resetting back to a more distributed personal style of communication.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.100
Twitter was great in that everyone was in one place.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.820
So it was kind of easier to find people.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.820
But Mastodon feels a little bit more like old internet.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.120
Yeah.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.680
It feels like open source social media.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:32.120
I mean, and not just the fact that the underlying code is, but the philosophy of the federation and the different servers and the different smaller groups.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:32.500
Right.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.980
There's some downsides to it too.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:41.940
You know, the server I'm on had some downtime while they were like rejiggering all their infrastructure because they suddenly had 30,000 users.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:48.640
And all right, you know, I can do without, you know, Twitter slash Mastodon for six hours while they figure that out.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.380
And then they're back and we're going.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:50.640
Yeah.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.340
I'm going to go for a walk or get some work done.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.020
Yeah, exactly.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.100
Awesome.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:55.340
All right.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.280
Well, that's a cool badge.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.340
We'll come back to badges later.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.980
I think that that sets the stage.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.320
One more thing before we get into some of the tools.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:10.360
There's places like, I think Tailwind CSS might land in this realm.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.120
It's just too popular to search.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.240
Let's see.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.600
Just the Tailwind CSS, please.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.260
Or I know Poetry.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.260
I can't search for that alone, but Poetry with Python.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.540
If you go to their websites, they've got like a fancy website.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.300
Yes.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.140
You know what I mean?

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:27.540
Yes.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:35.460
And I see some open source projects like Vue.js maybe is like this, where it's almost like there's a marketing landing page for the project.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.620
And the newer ones, of course, it is.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.340
They'll have like a dark mode button.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.020
And do you, how do you think about this?

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.960
When you see this, you're like, oh, I need to do this.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.100
Or is this kind of.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.440
I've never been tempted to build a page like this, partly because I don't think I have the skills to build a page like this.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.880
And the things that I make are aimed at developers.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.240
I mean, you're showing a Poetry page landing page here, which is also aimed at developers.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.840
But I guess my feeling is developers don't need that kind of flash.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.180
Yeah.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.140
And honestly, if people use a different thing because it's flashier, that's okay.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.140
I'm not out to corner the market.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:11.420
Yeah.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.880
It's not JavaScript code coverage.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.440
It's not JavaScript.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.000
That's right.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.380
But also, I think sometimes it can be a little misleading.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.700
And just to go back to Mastodon for a sec.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.800
So one of the problems that people have with Mastodon is that they have to choose a server.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.960
And that's the first choice they have to make.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.240
And it's a difficult choice because it's an unfamiliar choice.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:35.880
If you go to joinmastodon.org, it's a flashy site with cartoon elephants and things on it.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.380
And it looks very easy.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.800
But then the first button you have to pick presents you with a choice that's hard.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.700
Here's your thousand choices.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.040
Pick one.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.860
Don't get it wrong.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:53.380
It might have been less cognitive dissonance if the page looked a little bit harder so that when you got that choice, you knew what you were getting into.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.200
It would kind of ease you into that hard choice.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:55.500
Yeah.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.040
I can see.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.960
Actually, I hadn't looked at the page in the last few weeks.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.100
They've actually changed it from choose a server to create account, which is good.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:01.380
Yeah.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.520
Because that feels more like what you're doing is creating an account rather than choosing a server.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.180
But you click create account and you're on the page that says servers.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:07.960
Yeah.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.300
Oh, well.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.720
They'll smooth that out.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.320
They'll smooth that out.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.380
You know, people used to be confused by Twitter.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.160
We figured it out.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.160
Yeah, I know.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:22.140
But I agree that it's an interesting kind of marketing angle for software, which is a little bit weird.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:22.460
Right.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:29.140
But I should say, so coverage.py does have a mascot, which was drawn by my son.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.520
Nice.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.120
So it's got that cute aspect to it, but not the whole page isn't cute.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.480
And actually, you're scrolling it on the screen.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.640
I'm noticing the mascot isn't on the GitHub.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.560
Should I go to the docs?

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:39.960
Page.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.140
Yeah.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.580
If you go to the docs, you'll see the mascot there in the upper left.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.120
Very cute.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.980
Sleepy snake.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:45.440
Yeah.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.700
So I've got a little bit of that, but that's because I've got a son who can draw like that.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.000
And he made me a mascot.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.020
If he hadn't done that, I wouldn't have anything cute on the-

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:54.980
Covered with a blanket.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.400
Got it.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:55.740
Yeah.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:02.300
He's relaxing because he knows his tests are all covering his product and he's sleeping well.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.080
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by the Local Maximum Podcast.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.240
It's an interesting and technical podcast that dives into trends in technology, stats, and more.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.660
But rather than tell you about it, let's hear from Max and Aaron about their show.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.080
We are now on with Talk Python to Me.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.840
Let's say hi to all the Python fans.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.840
Hi, Python fans.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.960
I'm Max Sklar.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.580
I have actually done a lot with Python myself, so I am a fan of Talk Python.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.060
Do you know Python, Aaron?

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.840
I took a course years ago, but I am a little rusty.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.980
We are here today to talk about our podcast, The Local Maximum.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.720
We've been on a roll lately with a new episode every week, and I wanted to share with you what

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.400
we've been up to.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.420
Here on The Local Maximum, we tackle subjects in software and technology, topics as diverse

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:54.460
as the philosophy of probability to Elon Musk's next move.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.680
For Talk Python listeners, I want to highlight a couple of recent episodes of The Local Maximum.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:05.000
In 248, for example, I found out about an open source library that maps the world into hexagons.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.080
And some pentagons.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.340
I had a discussion with an author about games and puzzles, and another on a novel approach

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.540
to doing the job search well.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.500
We discussed the ramifications of AI-generated art.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.060
Have we reached peak creativity, or is this just another Local Maximum?

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.080
So check out The Local Maximum podcast available on your podcast app.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:28.520
Okay, well, I think that's at the stage for this conversation pretty well.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.200
Let's talk about ReadMe as a service.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.560
Have you played with this any?

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.740
So I haven't played with this.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.760
I tend to be very low tech in the way I approach things.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.280
You know, edit some text files, build some tooling to make the result you want, and get

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:41.580
going.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.260
So this looks like a good way to get started.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.700
Like if you don't know what to do, this looks like a good on-ramp.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.500
So it looks great.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.420
If that's the way you like to approach things, definitely do it.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:58.480
My philosophy is any way you can get a good ReadMe is a good way to get a good ReadMe.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.020
So if this is going to help people, then I'm all for it.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.880
It's not something you tie into your ReadMe.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.780
It's a web app.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.280
And it looks like one of these marketing page, landing page builders.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.820
So on the left, it's got a bunch of different sections.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.660
Like you can drag them in.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.800
So you drag in the title and description.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.380
You drag in the acknowledgements and fill it out.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.580
And it will create the skeleton markdown.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.900
And then you just take the markdown and run with it.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.060
Right.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.420
But it gives you a lot of structure.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.680
Like, well, here's how a lot of people put their author acknowledgements.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.540
Or here's how they put their example code or FAQ.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.020
If this is...

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.040
So I haven't played with it.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.960
But if the output of this is a markdown file that you then own and edit later on,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.800
this is just a sort of a quick start templating thing.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.820
I'm pretty sure that's how it works.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:40.980
Yeah.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.380
Any way to do it.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:48.820
I'm personally always a little bit skeptical about new tools that I have to keep in my tool

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.400
chain and keep working and hope will remain maintained.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.320
Personally, like low tech approaches.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.180
Like I said, if you...

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.620
I have a text file that I can edit.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.120
Great.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:58.940
I'm all set.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:04.200
So I like that this tool is a way to get started, but then gives you the text file that you then

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.480
own.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.120
Yeah, exactly.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.620
So when you're in a section, you just are working on these various pieces.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.160
It kind of is like a function.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.440
I'm just editing the internal, but it puts it all together in a whole thing and you get

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.500
just a raw markdown with a copy button.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.180
And it seems pretty neat to me.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:21.840
It is neat.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.100
And because some of this stuff can be overwhelming.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.260
I mean, markdown syntax is designed to be as straightforward as possible.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:34.140
But once you get to badges, which are images with alt text with links, the syntax is no longer

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.800
simple and it's hard to remember how to do it.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.240
So having a way to mash a button and have a badge show up on the page.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:40.820
Great.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:41.580
Let's do it.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.080
So this was created by Catherine Olsner.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.020
Olster?

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.660
Olsner.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.780
And yeah, she works at GitHub.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.240
So that's pretty cool.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.500
But yeah, it's just basically a start from scratch and generate if you don't have a good

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:53.840
example.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.940
So I kind of like that one.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:55.200
Yeah.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.880
And GitHub, in general, has one of their philosophies is we'll make on ramps for people

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.440
to do open source, right?

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.080
And like they've got in their documentation and their help, they've got how to use a console,

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.100
which isn't their problem to solve.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:14.320
But they know that people are stuck getting into GitHub if they don't know how to use the

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:14.660
console.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.220
So they're teaching people how to use the console.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.520
They've got choosealicense.com because people don't know how to choose a license and they

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.000
need to in order to do open source well.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.100
And so on and so forth.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.980
So I love the on ramps that GitHub has built for these things.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.260
Yeah.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.100
And just the community as well, right?

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.240
You know, if you put your time and energy into this, there's a chance that people will

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.320
come along, appreciate what you've built and contribute to it as opposed to...

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.560
It's a social coding site.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.460
That's their tagline.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.400
Yeah, that definitely is.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.060
They seem to be living up to it.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:40.280
Okay.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.320
Another one that comes from...

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.260
Yeah, this is the other end of the spectrum.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.820
This is the other end.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.800
There's a couple of other ones here.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.600
This is from Hinnick.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:56.520
This is your fancy project deserves a fancy pants readme based on Hatch or with Hatch.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.000
Right.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.520
Yeah.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.420
So what do you know about this one?

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.160
Have you done anything with it?

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.880
I looked at this a bit and this looks like I said the other end of the spectrum.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.760
So readme.so is kind of a visual graphical way to get started.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.540
This thing by Hynick Slowak is a templating tool where you can automate the putting together

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.300
of your readme from different bits of information from all over your repo.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.920
And it is a little bit overwhelming how much is there.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:31.560
You look at the examples and you're editing .toml files with five dotted nested sections to get

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.720
the right pieces in place.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.120
There we go.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.880
And I totally understand this because I have built tools like this too where I thought,

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.720
you're a developer.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.000
You can write me a regex when it comes time to tell me what to do.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.880
So I totally understand this and I need to look more at it because it looks like it solves

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.480
some problems that I might be facing myself and my own.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.780
Like if you look at the coverage.py repo, there's a lot of custom tooling to do these sorts of

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.120
things.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:21:00.140
And if I can find other people's supported tools to do the right things, I would like to

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:00.500
use them.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:05.840
I mean, like I said, I tend to spawn new side projects when I need tooling, but that's not

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.720
a scalable solution to things.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.800
I should use other people's tools more.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.520
They built AF, they built some good ones that are out there.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.320
So here, let me see if I can find a section.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.760
There's a little part.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.760
That's it.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.620
The impressive thing.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.680
So when I first came to this, I thought I haven't heard of this Hatch Fancy PyPI readme

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:28.280
project, but under showcases, the black readme is built using this tool.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.740
And that's fine credential right there that the black project is using it.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.360
Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.320
And you've also...

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.320
As well as a bunch of others.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:35.740
Yeah.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.180
Structlog and JSON schema.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:38.460
Yeah.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:38.660
Yeah.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.360
JSON schema.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:39.640
Yeah.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:39.860
Yeah.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.400
So maybe I could read this one paragraph and this might give people the sense.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.820
Do you want your PyPI readme to be the project readme, but without badges followed by the

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.800
license file and the changelog section only for the latest release?

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.120
Well, you've come to the right place.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.600
So it's like...

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:59.500
He's got this whole assembly line model of there's already a bunch of information out

00:21:59.500 --> 00:21:59.780
there.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.740
So don't copy it around.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.440
Don't try to write it in two places.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.860
Instead, have a tool, pick up the information and then put it together into the readme, which

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.500
is what you want.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.200
And I totally understand that because I've got some...

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:16.060
I've done some of that kind of tooling myself in my projects so that I can put a piece of

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.780
information in just one place and then it goes to where it has to go to be read.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.980
It's a bit like a static site generator.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.460
A bit.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:22.980
A little bit.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.000
The thing I still haven't wrapped my head around here is that what feels like it could

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.620
be one template.md file or something that says, you know, grab this from there and that

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.600
from there is instead in your PyProject.toml sections.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:43.400
So you don't end up with sort of what looks like a readme.md file with callouts to where

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.620
the information should come from.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.500
It's pieced together from the PyProject.toml sections.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:48.900
I see.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.080
The toml lets you reach into the different segments of the thing that's there.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.640
Yeah.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.480
And I understand why he's taking that approach because the PyProject.toml is there and this

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.340
is a hatch plugin.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:05.060
So he's already got access to that information and it's bolted into the process of building

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.380
the distribution, which is the exact best time to build the readme.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.820
So it's cool that he's explored it this way.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.260
I have to take a deeper look at it to see if it would fit in with my workflow.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.420
I don't use hatch.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:17.740
Yeah.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.060
Hatch is nice and hatchlane is nice.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.480
And I've done a little bit of work with it.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.440
And I can see why if you're already working in that mode, how to kind of extend it.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.160
Absolutely.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:28.980
Yeah.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.640
One of the problems with coverage.py, which is my main side project is because it's 18

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.980
years old, there are bits of it that are using the latest, greatest technology as of 15 years

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.260
ago.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:43.840
And because it's just kept working, you know, until it breaks, I'm not going to go and fiddle

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.900
with it or until I'm interested in fiddling with it, I might fiddle with it.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.060
But there's a lot of stuff that's just old and weird and just keeps rattling along.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.220
For such a highly used project, I can see the danger here.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:59.620
But have you considered or have you run it through things like Flint to convert all the

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.620
strings to fstrings?

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.160
Have you or some of these like upgrade to the latest idioms where you can say, I want it to

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.440
be 3, 7 and above.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.700
And anything that's older than that, you know, kind of rework it.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.540
I have used pi upgrade on it when I dropped 2.7, which was a couple of years back.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.400
And there are now fstrings all through it.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.120
But for instance, I don't use black.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.240
I there is a pull request to add type annotations to it.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.820
But it's a big project that doesn't not gaining the momentum it needs to get done.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.780
So I tend to, you know, let sleeping dogs lie where it's working.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.980
And or if I don't, I don't know what I'm going to get out of it.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.240
For instance, I use opt parse to parse the command line arguments.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.980
And that wasn't even the right thing to use in 2.7.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.760
That was the old thing that arg parse replaced.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.000
But it still works.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.840
It's still in there.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.960
It's fine.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.380
You know, sometimes there's no value in possibly adding bugs to something that you don't intend

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.200
to touch at all.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:54.740
Right, right.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.140
Exactly.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.020
But maybe if you were to say, like, we're going to really dramatically expand the way

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.900
that it can take arguments and do things.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.480
Well, then maybe all of a sudden you are like, we could get more flexibility with a new thing.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.640
But if you're not going to touch it, then just let it be.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.060
Yeah.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.480
All right.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.720
Let's get to the next one here.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.440
Shields.io.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.040
Yes.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.180
If you want a badge, come to the place.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.640
Shields.io, they will make a badge for you.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:21.940
And this Shields.io is a very impressive service, I have to say, because they give you lots of

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.020
ways to make badges, including ways that I didn't even understand they could do.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:31.040
I found this out when actually when I made that Mastodon badge that you can tell Shields.io

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:37.800
to go and grab some JSON from some other website and extract data from that JSON response and

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.120
include it in your badge.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:45.080
So you just call the Mastodon API, public API to get stuff about your account and pull it.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:51.980
If you look at my Mastodon badge, which is on GitHub slash Nedbat or on the coverage.py page,

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.660
it has my count of followers.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:26:00.300
And that's coming from a JSON response from the Mastodon API on my server, on my Mastodon server.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:06.220
And then Shields.io is incorporating that number into the image that it then serves to GitHub

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.220
to display into the readme. I don't want to think about how many computers are actually

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.720
involved to get that stupid number on that page. But it's very impressive that I can do all that.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.860
I sure hope it's cash somewhere.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.740
I hope so. I don't know.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.380
How interesting.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.900
Yeah, they've got a bunch of these prebuilt badges that can tell you all sorts of things.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:29.100
Like, you know, what version of your project is current on PyPI and what Python versions it

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:33.380
supports and what your license is and all sorts of things. It's very impressive.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:39.020
Yeah, it supports not just Python, but I saw Node.js, Nougat, PowerShell.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.560
Yeah.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.060
Stuff that I don't spend as much time on over here.

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.200
Yeah, there's things I've never even heard of that it shows here.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:44.520
SourceForge.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.380
They don't even document all the things it can do. I mentioned earlier that the badge on the

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:56.260
PyPI page will show the status of the latest PyPI release, which means if you go back 10 years to

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:01.300
the coverage.py, you know, version 3 release, there's a badge on it that shows you that it

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.660
supports Python 3.11 because the badge is showing you the most recent release, even though you're

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.980
looking at the badge on the 10-year-old release.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:08.240
Yeah.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:14.760
There's a syntax in Shields.io that will let you say, show me this factoids as of this particular

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.000
release 3.0.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.320
I see.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.800
And they don't document it, so I didn't realize I could do that. So there's an awful lot going

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.820
on in Shields.io.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:26.700
Yeah. So if you want a Shield for one of those little badges for basically anything, these are,

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:32.620
you know, got downloads, users, test coverage, all these things. There's just a...

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:32.760
Right.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:39.120
Basically, they give you a URL, right, that you put in into your readme, and that becomes the badge

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:39.940
as it resolves, right?

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:45.040
Right. The URL returns you an image with the information on it that you want. Either information

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.900
that you put into the URL, you can just make a URL that says, you know, Michael Kennedy is cool,

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:55.400
and it will return to you an image that says Michael Kennedy is cool. So, you know, it'll just format

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:00.120
things for you, but it also has ways of getting information and then formatting it to give back to

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:00.260
you.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:06.460
Okay. You probably could put this personally onto places, not just on your project.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:06.720
Right.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.780
But maybe on your GitHub profile, potentially.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.880
Absolutely. Yeah, my GitHub...

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.740
Like the social.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.140
I'm embarrassed to talk about how over-automated my GitHub profile page is.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:24.640
I love it. All right. Shields.io, that's a section for the live badges. This one is hot off

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:30.240
the presses. Let's see if we can find... Oh, it says initial commit. We got it 10 days ago.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:37.320
Will McGuggan of Rich... Rich and Textual. And Textual, yeah. Put out a tool to generate a GitHub

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:45.480
flavored FAQ.markdown document. This is pretty neat. This is a tool. I just took a quick look at it. It's

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:51.460
in a similar vein that you want to make little bits of information in a convenient way and then have it

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:57.580
published as a monolithic piece of information. In this case, he's talking about FAQ questions. And I think

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.340
he said somewhere here, I got tired of answering the same questions over and over, so I made a tool

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.260
to make an FAQ or something like that. Yeah. I don't know. I don't have the same problem of needing

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:11.520
FAQs produced or why it's easier to put them all in separate little files that are combined together

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:18.500
later than just editing one big FAQ page. But Will's a smart guy. He must have had a problem and he solved

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:23.220
with this tool and it's cool to see. This is a little more similar to the way you described how

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:28.920
you might see building up the readme. Instead of defining an automo file, reaching into a giant

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:34.260
document, have a bunch of small ones to get assembled into a result here. Right. And that's a lot like some

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:40.460
of the change log management tools that we're going to get to also. Yeah. One of the things that prompted

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:48.140
Will to do this, he says here is people will ask the same question over and over and he in issues and

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:53.980
he's like, you know, I can't, I just can't answer it again. How to make a table. I mean, or can I make it?

00:29:53.980 --> 00:30:00.460
So yes, you can make a table. Here's the link, whatever that is. So it has a fuzzy, fuzzy matching

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:06.040
on suggest. So I think this is why it's separate because you can put alias questions to the frequent

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.680
question. Yeah. And then you can just on the terminal on the shell, you can say factory suggest.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.960
And if you have some kind of input to it, like I took the question that somebody asked me and I want

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:24.960
to point them at the thing so I can just jam that into the terminal and it'll go actually that matches

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:30.880
over to this FAQ response. I think that's the idea. And he says that it's designed to be used with a

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:36.760
GitHub action to post an automated response on an issue, I guess is the point is that if he's getting

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.640
a ton of issues that all need to be answered, instead of saying, go and read the FAQ, he can,

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:47.060
he's automated the process of putting the answer right onto the issue, which is cool. That's,

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.960
I didn't realize that aspect of it. So that's very cool. So this is all of 10 days old. People can

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.840
check that out if they want. Hot off the presses, torn from today's headlines. Exactly.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:05.300
This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by Sentry. How would you like to remove a little

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:11.160
stress from your life? Do you worry that users may be encountering errors, slowdowns, or crashes with

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:16.340
your app right now? Would you even know it until they sent you that support email? How much better

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:21.480
would it be to have the error or performance details immediately sent to you, including the call stack

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:27.820
and values of local variables and the active user recorded in the report? With Sentry, this is not only

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:34.760
possible. It's simple. In fact, we use Sentry on all the Talk Python web properties. We've actually fixed a bug

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:40.720
triggered by a user and had the upgrade ready to roll out as we got the support email. That was a great email

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.140
to write back. Hey, we already saw your error and have already rolled out the fix. Imagine their surprise.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:53.780
Surprise and delight your users. Create your Sentry account at talkpython.fm/sentry. And if you sign up with

00:31:53.780 --> 00:32:00.220
the code talkpython, all one word, it's good for two free months of Sentry's business plan, which will give

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:06.680
you up to 20 times as many monthly events as well as other features. Create better software, delight your

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:13.460
users, and support the podcast. Visit talkpython.fm/sentry and use the coupon code talkpython.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:22.320
We talked about contributions and how people appreciate getting credit for participating.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:28.440
You know, like I'm sure there are people who have closed a small issue or found and fixed a small bug

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.140
in coverage.py or added a small feature and feel really proud of that, right? But yeah, they would

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:38.780
feel more proud if you acknowledged that they did it, right? I accept your PR, right? Of course.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:45.700
So tell us about this all contributors place here. This is a GitHub bot that on an issue,

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:52.620
you can say, you know, add all contributors, add Michael Kennedy to the bug fix sections of the

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:57.060
contributors because he did it right here in this issue that we're talking about. And that's really

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:02.120
cool because I don't use this tool. Like I said, I tend to be very low tech. I do acknowledge my

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:07.420
contributors. I'll mention them in the changelog. And I have a contributors.txt file that lists everyone

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:12.760
who's contributed in some way. And I will hand edit that. And it can be, you know, I have to remember

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:18.080
to put it over there and put it over there. I don't get so many contributions to coverage.py that it's

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:23.120
a burden. And I kind of actually like that little sort of moment of zen of, you know, finishing the

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.020
paperwork and crossing the T and dotting the I's. But if you're on a big project where you are getting

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:33.840
a lot of contributions, I could see how doing this with a bot would be, you know, save you that little

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:39.000
bit of work that that could become a big amount of work. And you don't want to skip it, right?

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.920
Because like we said, it's seems like a small thing to us and maybe like, I don't want to have

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.080
to bother. But it's a huge thing to the contributor to have their name mentioned.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:47.600
Yes. Yeah.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.560
And maybe not just pride. Maybe they get a job because of it. Right. They could say,

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:56.240
I'm getting hired to work on Flask. Look here. I'm listed as a contributor on Flask.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.180
That puts me above 99% of the other people applying.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.620
That's right.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.340
At least in that regard.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:04.280
The internet is the kind of place where you don't, when you're, you get a little connection

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.120
like that, you never know what it's going to lead to.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:06.400
Yes.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.620
There's all sorts of things that pop up because of the strangest little mentions.

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:11.940
So true.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.980
You might get invited to be on a podcast just because someone mentioned one of your dopey

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.580
little tools on Mastodon.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.080
Or you might even start a podcast.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.560
You might even start a podcast. Yeah. Watch out.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.180
That's right.

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:22.820
There's danger ahead.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:28.120
And then you're really in for it. So the way that this allcontributors.org bot seems to work,

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.920
I don't use it personally because I don't have projects that are big enough to really

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:37.860
justify this in terms of open source projects. But in the comment on an issue or on a PR or

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:43.000
one of those types of things, you can just say at all contributors, please, please add at

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.620
GitHub name of contributor. And then it says for design or for bug fixes or for documentation.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:54.060
And then the dot, the dot, the bot says added them as contributor. That's, that's really cool.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:58.360
Yeah. So I, like I said, I have a text file. One of the, one of the unusual things I do with my text

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:04.360
file is that when I build for coverage.py, when I build the release, if you go and look at who,

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:10.980
who the author of coverage.py is, it says Ned Batchelder and 137 other people. And that number,

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:16.540
137 is counting the number of lines in the contributors.txt. Cause I want it to be clear

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:20.140
that, yeah, it's not just me. There's lots of people helping with this and you can help too.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.120
Yeah. Especially over 18 years.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:22.760
Well, yeah.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:28.940
All right. Getting to the part of expanding beyond just readme.md, but the broader

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:35.680
experience of things that maybe gets, gets their way pulled back into the readme is a changelog.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.340
Yes.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.040
Are you familiar with keepachangelog.com? Have you seen this?

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.420
I am very familiar with keepachangelog.com.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.520
All right. Tell people about this.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:47.660
So keepachangelog is basically an advocacy site that says you should really have a changelog. And

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:53.200
here's what we mean by that. And why should you do it? And I absolutely agree with the idea

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.260
of keeping a changelog, which is a running history of what has changed in your project.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:04.600
And that's because people that your users want to know what's changed. I mean, it sounds really

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:10.860
simple, really basic, but I think people can approach it in really simple ways that aren't

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:15.420
as valuable. And if you put a little bit more work into it, you'll find it's really, really valuable.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:22.200
And you need to know as a consumer of a library, is there an immediacy to this new version that I

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.360
need to pay attention to? Is there a risk to this new version that I should be aware of?

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.900
Or do I don't care? And I just leave my thing pinned the way it was before, right? If it says

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:35.940
there is a CVE where if we send the dollar sign, it takes over your server, like you should get in

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:36.740
there straight away.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:37.940
Yes, exactly.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:38.640
Exactly.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:43.100
But if it says we deprecated this thing that you were depending upon, like, well, don't just push it.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.460
We're going to need to think about this.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:49.280
Right. And I think the way you just described that is really good, which is that the user of the tool,

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.320
the library, the application, they want to understand, you know, what's in it for me?

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:58.740
Like from my perspective, what has gone on with this library? And I think that's one of the things

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:04.840
that's difficult for people is for maintainers is to put themselves in their user's shoes and think,

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.100
what's changed about this that matters?

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:07.360
Yeah.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.840
There are some auto-generated changelogs that, for instance, just put all the git commit messages

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:16.900
in the changelog. And those drive me nuts because they're telling me all sorts of things that I don't

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:22.360
care about. I don't care that you restyled, changed all the spaces to tabs in some file.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:27.120
That doesn't matter to me. That's just noise. You're hiding, you're burying the lead by telling

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:33.020
me stuff that doesn't matter. So keep a changelog is a good, like I said, advocacy site. They have

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.580
their guiding principles. Change logs are for humans, not machines, things like that. And they

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:44.140
advocate for marking your commits with, or marking your changelogs, putting them into sections of what's

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:49.200
been added, what's been changed, what's been deprecated so that, you know, people can zero in on what

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.520
matters, right? Deprecated means I can't use the thing anymore and I need to make a change. And security

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:59.300
means I really better get on this or I might be in trouble. So it's good to highlight those things and

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:03.860
put it into the user's perspective. But I like the guiding principles here about it's

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:09.920
for humans. Every version should have one. The release date should be specified. It's easy to

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.420
just say, well, version 2.1 had these changes. Like, well, wait a minute. We're on three. Like,

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:18.080
was that last week or five years ago? I need to know how relevant.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:23.280
Date things. I mentioned my son doing art. I always told him when he was a kid, put the date on the

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.640
picture. So I'll know how old you were when you made the picture and you never wanted to do it.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.900
But change logs, you can put dates on things. Like you said, you don't know how long ago something

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.480
was. Yeah. Don't have to go back and diff the thing to figure out when it was committed. Right. All

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:42.400
right. And we've got one chat from a viewer talking about creating change logs, like as a good job for

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:48.580
AI. And these days, I don't know, 2022, not only is, you know, Twitter versus Mastodon, but chat GP,

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:54.500
what's it called? The AI thing? GP3, I think. Yeah. Something like that. Seems to be amazing.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:39:00.420
And I can probably retire soon because it's going to do my job, I think. Yeah. And just yell commands,

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:05.460
just yell stuff at the computer from like the couch. Computer, go write the website. Just make it

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:12.620
better. Scale the website, computer. Exactly. Oh yeah. That's a good point. Mario out there says it's

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.880
called Skynet. There are some amazing tools, like a bit of a diversion, but there's like this thing

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.700
called Jasper that a friend just told me about. And what you do is you write, it's like Google

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:28.380
Copilot for writing content. And there's just, there's a bunch of crazy, crazy things out there.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:34.280
Yeah. It is. We've seen a complete change in the progression of things and it's astounding.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:39.420
It is. All right. Well, let's get to one of the first tools that got you recommended. The reason

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:44.260
I invited you is because I asked people for general recommendations and they kept recommending your

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.540
tools. I'm like, all right, well, I should just have Ned come on the show to talk about this.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:52.520
I'll just come in and talk about all of it. Sure. All right. So we, we saw the, keep a change log

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.300
ideas, but that's in theory, not in practice, right? Right. To keep a change log just says,

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.040
look, you should write this stuff and here's how you should write it. It's not a tool.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.880
It's just encouraging people to do a good job. I looked around at tools when I wanted to get

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:11.600
people to make better change logs. And there was one called town crier from the twisted project.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:16.900
And they solved the problem that a lot of change logs have. So if you just have a change log file

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:20.600
and everyone who makes a change to the code is supposed to put an entry into the change log file,

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:25.800
then that file becomes a merge conflict every time, right? Because I added a feature. I put my thing at

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.680
the top. You added a feature. You put a thing at the top and it's a merge conflict. Years ago at work,

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.960
what I tried to do is have a change log file. And I told developers, put your change near the top of

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.120
the file in the hopes that they wouldn't merge conflict. And developers would come to me and say,

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.860
what do you mean by near the top of the file? Because they're engineers, they need precise directions,

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:49.080
right? So, okay, that wasn't going to work. So the idea that town crier uses, and also the cpython

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:53.940
source code has a thing called blurb that does the same idea, which is when you make a change to the code,

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:59.420
you also write one small file, which has just the entry for the change log in it. And you check that

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:04.740
in. There's a special directory that just has those little fragments in it. And so when you make your

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:09.440
code change, you also add a fragment to that directory. And then later, when it's time to actually

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.780
put everything, you know, make a release, all those fragments can be concatenated together to become

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:19.460
the change log. And the good thing about that is that you don't have merge conflicts because everyone

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:24.660
creates their own fragment. They have, you know, unique names based on some principle. And then at

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:29.540
publication time, you know, when the release is made, they can get concatenated together. And like

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:34.780
I said, town crier did this and blurb also did this. I looked at them and they were both a bit more

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:41.120
opinionated than I wanted. I knew that if I was going to get a lot of people to use this thing, that it

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:46.580
needed to be very, very flexible. And I actually took an approach when I was building Scriv of what's the

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:50.900
least opinionated I can be. How many different ways can I let you decide how you want it to work?

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:57.620
At the time, black was rising in its popularity and it was famously opinionated. And so I sort of took

00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:02.780
the opposite approach. Nice. Scriv's, the idea is that it's got a few commands. You say Scriv create

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:07.620
to make a fragment, Scriv collect to collect them all together. Those are the two main ones.

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:12.000
Scriv looks like, it looks like a great tool. And it looks like one of these things you could pipx

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.300
install because you're not going to, it's unlikely you'll depend upon it for your code to run.

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.440
You just need that command around to manage a project.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:25.500
Right. Or you can put it into your development requirements.txt or however it is you manage

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:31.600
your project tooling. But sure, pipx would work too. And it's actually grown one other command

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:37.140
for making GitHub releases. So it will actually parse your changelog file. Even if your changelog

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:42.580
file wasn't made by Scriv, it will parse your changelog file and then create a GitHub release

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:48.640
from your changelog file, which gets at a philosophical opinionated point of mine, which is that

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:53.060
the information should live in just one place. And that place should be a file that you check

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:57.600
into Git. It should be a file that people can clone when they clone your repo. If they want

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.760
to just look at the changelog in Emacs or whatever locally, they should be able to do that. And since

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:07.020
you don't want to duplicate information, but people do seem to like having GitHub releases

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:11.540
make, you know, publish a GitHub release based on the information from the changelog file,

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:16.440
rather than having the release be the source of truth where it can't be cloned. It can't be

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:21.580
edited. It can't be, you know, there's no commits that you can track to see who put that text there,

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.420
those sorts of things.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.380
Okay. And that makes a lot of sense. Let's see. Out in the audience, we got in a question.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:32.320
Last changelog I read was for Python 3.11. Did you read that? Have you read? It's a bit of a novel.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:37.600
The CPython developers have taken to heart the idea. And I make it sound like this is a recent

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.240
development. They've always done this. You know, there's a Python 3.11 has a what's new in 3.11.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.740
And they tend to be very, very detailed about putting stuff in the what's new document. And like

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:53.080
I said, they've got their own custom tool called Blurb, which is how CPython core developers,

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.980
they write what are called news entries, which get created as small files in a custom,

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:02.920
in a dedicated directory. And then those get aggregated into the what's new document.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:10.080
In that changelog, there's 180,000 words. Typical novel is like 80,000. So that's a proper changelog

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:10.600
right there.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.420
There's more information there than any one person needs, but everything that's there,

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.640
someone does need.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.160
That's right.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:17.440
Right.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:22.080
And each one of those links to like a GitHub issue or a PEP or something like that.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:22.640
Yeah.

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.520
And there's a lot of those. I just noticed, I think it was today that they got GitHub

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.200
issued number 100,000 in the CPython.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.740
Wow. Okay. That's major.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:31.000
Yeah.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.520
It's been chugging along for a while. All right. So this looks like a great idea. What do we

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.520
got up next? Oh, I just also wanted to just give credit, speaking of giving credit from

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:44.860
Colin Sullivan, who sent this in amongst some other things as well over on Mastodon. So thanks

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.940
for sharing that. This is another one. I'm going to go quick because it's not a Python

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:52.760
tool and it's actually in a technology I've never heard of. Maybe you've heard of it, Ned.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.780
So I hadn't heard of this. So this is called Changelog Manager from Masukomi. And it's

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:03.780
interesting that he, Masukomi, is one of those bloggers from 15 or 20 years ago that I'd lost

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:09.420
track of and suddenly got reconnected to on Mastodon. And when I asked about, I got a little

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:14.020
petulant on Mastodon about a changelog that I found completely useless. And he chimed in

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:19.740
with a long thread about how aggravated he is by changelogs and how hard it is to get people

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.740
to do them well and pointed me at this tool that he had written about.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:27.160
It looks like a cool tool. People can check it out if it works well. It's written in a language

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.980
called or technology called Crystal. I feel.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.660
Yeah. I don't know what that is.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:36.800
Makes me feel old all of a sudden not even know that that's a language. I don't know. But wait,

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.160
hey, look, it's Colin's out in the audience. Oh, hey, Colin. Yeah.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.720
Thanks for the recommendation. You got me on here.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:49.660
Yeah, absolutely. So this is a cool project here and people can check it out. And yeah,

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.680
it's got a lot of the philosophy of how you should do it, how you shouldn't just have

00:45:53.680 --> 00:46:01.280
commit messages. I remember hearing about tools that would look for swearing and other kinds of

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:07.320
frustration in commit messages and not allow those particular messages to get into the changelog.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:12.040
But I don't think that, as you pointed out already, that individual commits are generally

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.580
the right granularity.

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:17.960
Right. Commits definitely are not. Some of these tools will aggregate your pull requests

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:23.540
to be the changelogs. And that's a little bit better because they're larger grained. But even so,

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:29.600
I think there's real value in hand curating your changelog. Start with a list of pull requests,

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.120
but then take a look at it, reorder them so they make some sense and tell the story.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.960
Right. Put the important stuff on top.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.600
Put the important stuff on top. If you have three pull requests, which just by coincidence all changed

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:46.060
how you handle file matching, then make an entry that says, we changed a bunch of things about file

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:51.180
matching and then have sub bullets about the file matching changes. You want to explain things to

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:55.220
people and you're going to be able to do a better job of it than your pull requests or your commit

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.420
messages. Absolutely. All right. Well, thanks for that, Colin.

00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:03.660
Executable books. The executable books folks are interesting. They've got a lot of tools that will

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:11.660
take Jupyter Notebooks and other things using the MIS plugin for markdown and generate books in

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:16.520
different ways. And so they've got this project called GitHub Activity, which generates a simple

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:25.840
markdown changelog based on that. Let's see. I think this is on issues and PRs, not commits.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:30.860
Yeah. I think this is one of the ones that goes for the larger chunked bits of information,

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:37.480
which like I said, is good. Commits are too small. The issue is still that when you write a pull

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.540
request, what you're writing about mostly is something that your reviewer needs to read.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:46.440
Right. So you're really addressing your collaborators rather than your users. I mean,

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:52.760
ideally your pull request would include all of the user consequences as well, but it's also going to

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.940
talk about what your collaborators need to know. So different audiences, different information at the,

00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:02.820
at the very least, it's going to need an editing pass in order to figure out how to actually explain

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:03.800
this to people the right way.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:09.060
Sure. Well, that's an interesting idea. Maybe the tools don't have to be perfect. Maybe they could say,

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:14.140
well, here are the 10 things in terms of PRs and issues that have changed. Now just rewrite that for

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.300
humans with a different audience. That still could be valuable.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:21.300
Yeah. Collecting up all the information. That's great. I just think it needs, it needs a human

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:21.700
touch.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.140
Yes.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.980
That's controversial in these days of AI, but I think humans can do a good job writing stuff.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:34.980
Indeed. As we say, get up co-pilot, write me a, no. So the next one we come to is Dinghi?

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:35.620
Dinghy.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.740
Dinghy. Okay. Dinghy. Got it. Just like the little boat thing.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:38.880
The little boat. That's right.

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.140
Okay.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.900
Yeah. So this is a tool that I wrote and it was interesting because when Colin mentioned this

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:48.880
as a tool for changelogs, it didn't, that's not why I wrote Dinghy. Dinghy is designed to give you a

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:53.600
daily digest of GitHub activity, which by the way is why it's called Dinghy because the D-I

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:58.300
stands for digest and there's a G-H in it, which stands for GitHub. And I looked through words that

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.540
had those pairs in them and Dinghy popped out.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:03.100
Nice. And it's got a Y, which is like half a Python for pies.

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.580
And it's got, yeah. And then you can, you can backfill the marketing slogan of, you know,

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.500
your lifeboat on a sea of information or something like that.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.100
There you go.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:16.320
Dinghy just gives you a digest of your GitHub activity. I was finding at work that I had to

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.680
track lots of issues and pull requests and there were lots of repos where I wanted to know what

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:26.440
was going on. And so I found it useful to just summarize the activity on issues and pull requests

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.320
across repos.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:27.960
This is nice.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:32.420
Yeah. In the morning, take a look what happened on the last day. Oh, I should, you know, I should dive

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:36.480
deeper into that one. I can click into it and go read the real issue, but you just can get a,

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:41.280
get a quick overview, but I can see how, so I use it sort of on a daily basis, but I could see how

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:48.180
you could take this and get a digest of the last three months and then use that as at least a guide

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.520
to where to get the information for a change log. If not, you know, pulling information right off.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:56.920
It seems real helpful if you work on a team, especially if you're the team lead or kind of a

00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:00.700
manager type and you're like, all right, just need to see what's happened on these three projects

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.640
this week. Exactly. Just hit it.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.980
That's what it's for. And it's, it's satisfying to hear people think of other uses for it. That's

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:12.300
the sign of having built a useful tool is that I meant it for one thing, but then someone else

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.480
sees, oh, I could use it for that too. And that's very gratifying.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:19.860
I can see it at the end of a sprint, like the sort of post-mortem burn down type of thing.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.080
Yep.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.340
Yeah. Okay. Cool. Cool.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:27.800
You mentioned blurb. I'll just put a link to, to the blurb project tool as well. This is the

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:35.180
CPython prolific writer. This idea of building the change log from small fragments is something

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:39.800
that's happened a number of times. And I think it's a great idea. I think it's the right way to,

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:45.640
to do this kind of work. Agreed. One that comes, I, is this GitHub itself that does this? No,

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:51.060
there's not. There's a thing called release drafter and it drafts your next release notes

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:55.460
as PRs are merged into a master. Okay. So I haven't used this.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:51:00.500
This is another case of things going into GitHub actions. And I'm fascinated by this whole thing,

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:05.420
you know, as a project maintainer, I feel like there's sort of three large buckets of work.

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:10.460
There's the building, the product itself. I don't mean product to sell, but like coverage.py is a

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:14.720
product. There's maintaining the test suite for it, which is if you've got a large test suite is a

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:19.380
whole endeavor all to itself. There's all this project automation, you know, that we've been

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:23.060
talking about here today. You know, how do I get the releases made? I've got a make file,

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:27.260
what this command, how do I, what's, how do I bump the version up? Like all of that kind of,

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:31.300
and it feels like micro automation. You're doing it like one shell command at a time or a 10 little

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.440
Python, 10 line Python file or something. And the fact that there are all these tools around

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:39.580
that help with it and put it in GitHub actions. And you just, you make a GitHub,

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:45.040
a Git tag and suddenly it goes to PyPI and publishes the GitHub release and all that.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.260
That's fascinating to me how far you can automate those processes.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.880
They kind of build up like a snowball going downhill pretty quick because you're like,

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:55.760
well, if I could automate this thing and that thing, they're like, wait a minute. Now we just,

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.140
they click together and then it's, we're almost there.

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:04.860
I'm a late adopter of technology. I won't automate a thing until I know that it's exactly the way I

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:09.620
want it. And I've gotten completely sick of doing it by hand. But the good news is by then I do know

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:13.460
exactly what I want it to do. And so I can build the automation and I don't have to come back and

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:18.460
fiddle with it too much. Another big benefit I would say to that approach is every time it runs,

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:23.320
it could just warm your heart with a joy. Like I, you know what, I hold another two hours. I didn't do

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:28.000
that thing. That's right. The downside is when it does the wrong thing. So this weekend,

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:33.620
I actually had a big weekend this weekend. I released 1.0 of both Scriv and Dingy and the

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:41.680
first beta of coverage 7.0. And it turns out that the links to PyPI on the readme, no, the links to

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:46.820
my documentation from the PyPI readme are broken because they don't work if it's a beta release.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:51.760
And I didn't know that until the release was published and betas happen so infrequently,

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:56.940
it'll change again before I make another one. And it'll probably be broken too, because it's hard to

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:01.220
test this kind of automation. Like the good thing about building the product and building your test

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:05.780
suite for the product is that that is automation. You can run the crank on and you know if it's

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:11.660
working or not. Releasing projects, if you build automation for that, how do you test that if release

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:16.080
happened correctly other than actually making a release and then getting bug reports from people

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:20.780
about the 404s on your PyPI page, which is how I found out about this. It's a little frustrating.

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:28.100
For as much fantastic testing software and automation, sometimes you just got to hold your breath and

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:32.060
push the button. And you're not going to write a unit test that says, let's push this thing to

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:39.060
test.pypi.org and see if all the links on the readme are right. That's, I mean, maybe, I guess you could,

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:43.940
but if anyone's done that, please get in touch because I messed that up this weekend.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:49.240
At some point you got to go, okay, we've tested enough. It's got to go. And even if you write a

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:54.800
unit test, you know, it's not necessarily exactly the same. It's not the same and you'll fiddle with

00:53:54.800 --> 00:54:00.140
it and break it. And which is what happened to me. And yeah, absolutely. There'll be another release.

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:04.060
It's fine. There'll be another release. We'll get it fixed. All right. You mentioned Town Crier

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:09.000
already. I think maybe we can just carry on, but people can check that out as well. You know,

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.760
I guess give them a quick shout out as well while we're here. This comes from the Twisted project,

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:16.720
you said? Yeah. And Twisted is another of these projects that's been going for a very long time.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:22.300
So this is a mature tool. It's just a little bit quirky in the way that they wanted to do things.

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:27.220
I think at least when I first looked at it, it was something like the fixes went into a .fix file

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:32.840
and the features went into a .feature file, things like that, which just, and it didn't do markdown.

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:36.420
And I knew that I was going to have people who needed markdown, even though I prefer

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:43.280
restructured text. So I built Scriv to kind of along the same ideas, but in a more flexible way.

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:51.200
Right. Okay. Cool. One of the things you may have in your readme or other parts of your documentation,

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:56.840
your markdown files or restructured text, I suppose, would be example code. Like I talked about that.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:01.960
It would be nice to know some level of correctness to that, right?

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:02.460
Yes.

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:05.460
We have MKTestDocs. Tell us about this.

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:09.900
This is one of these things that's the interesting thing to me is that you've got docs, you've got tests,

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:15.220
you've got doc strings, and there's all these tools that do all the different pairings of stuff,

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:22.200
right? So you can run tests against the code in your doc strings. This runs pytest against markdown

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:27.980
files that have code in them. So it's running the code in the markdown files. And it's fascinating,

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:33.680
again, to see how all of this automation, this project level automation comes together to try to

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.940
close all those little gaps. Like I mentioned the problem of a broken URL on my readme. You could

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:43.960
also have code that you had typed into a markdown file, and it turns out it doesn't work for whatever

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:49.820
reason. Maybe it worked once, something changed. This will run the code in your markdown files so that

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.900
you know that it still works, which is great. I'm all for more testing.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:58.400
Yeah. Well, even if you're not actually trying to execute it, and like I'm asserting that my example

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:03.200
returns seven, because maybe it says connect to a database and do other crazy stuff, it could at least

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.060
be syntactically valid.

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:05.360
Yes.

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.780
Right. It could look at it and go, I loaded that up and I parsed that function and it didn't die.

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.540
That's a start.

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:16.640
Exactly. There's levels of testing. And like you said, it can get very complicated to do full testing of

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.260
some kinds of code.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:25.320
So how do you test your markdown, your readme.md? Well, see, I fire up a series of a cluster of Docker

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:29.720
containers using Docker Compose, and then we can run the one example and then it's good.

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:33.740
If there's a tool out there that launches missiles, I don't want to know how you're testing the code

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:34.960
in your readme.

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:39.660
Yeah. There's another one that is a little bit tough to test. One of the things that's interesting,

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:46.220
by the way, this tool comes from Vincent WormerDem, that it deals with multiple code blocks. So if you

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:52.820
do the language specifier in markdown, so the triple dot back tick, and then you just say the word

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:59.600
Python or JavaScript or C# or whatever, that'll tell the formatters, format it like,

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:04.380
this, right? It's this type of syntax you should see. So if you do the Python one,

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:10.220
it will run those. And it'll also do bash as well, I believe. But what's interesting is you could have

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:15.760
a, like, and here's how you set it up, and then here's how you call it type of series of code blocks.

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:21.340
And it will run all the code blocks, or you can actually say, you know, remember what you saw

00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:24.540
before, because that was the first half of what you need to do the second half.

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:27.720
Right. Because you're trying to tell a story. This is like a Jupyter notebook where you're

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:34.020
interspersing code with commentary and then more code, and you need the multiple blocks of code to

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:39.360
all be executed together, or, you know, one after the other. You need the first one's results in the

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:39.760
second one.

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:45.340
I certainly appreciate a don't completely repeat yourself every time in your code example,

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:49.280
right? It would say you get started by importing this, and then you would create a class like this

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:54.060
that it arrives from. You wouldn't want to have to have import, import, import over and over,

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:58.500
right? So yeah, this is cool. I don't use this one either, but it definitely looks like something I

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:06.540
could see adopting. Now here's something called shed, which is not exactly what I want to talk about,

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:11.420
but it's for formatting code. So it runs autoflake, it runs pyupgrade. You mentioned that before,

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:17.360
I believe, for upgrade. You can specify a version, pyupgrade me to Python 3.8, but not further,

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:17.760
please.

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.720
Pyupgrade is good.

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:23.940
Yeah. Yeah. It runs black. But what I do want to talk about is it runs black in docs.

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:30.940
Which formats the code in the doc strings and in your docs. Which again, is one of those pairings of,

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:35.380
let's put this tool into that thing and have it do just a little bit.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:41.000
This is super hard to get just right because you want to format code. And, you know, one of my

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.140
markdown editors, if I highlight some code and I hit shift tab to unindent, it'll put everything just to

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:51.180
the left. I'm like, no, no, no, no, this is Python code. It has to have the space. You can't just put

00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:55.680
it all the left, like undo one level, right? The things like that, where it's just like, oh, this,

00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:02.160
this is not quite formatted, right? Just running this maybe even as a pre commit hook would be

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:08.880
glorious. Just like all of my code in my examples and my triple back tick Python becomes black,

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:09.620
blackened.

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:15.920
Yep. And if you're using black, then you really want it everywhere, right? You've given up control

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:21.140
of the formatting of your code willingly. You see the value of it and you just want it everywhere.

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.560
And this is great for getting it into your docs too.

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:27.420
Exactly. Like there's, there's gaps. Maybe your Jupyter notebooks don't have black formatter,

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.560
like get it in there, get it into the docs, get it everywhere.

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:36.060
Yeah. Getting to read me. Cool. Okay. let's see this one. Another person gave a shout out to

00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:42.540
your next project here. This is Cy Gallimardi said, Hey, we should check out cog.

00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:48.380
Yeah. Cog is one of those tools that I wrote very long time ago to do one particular thing.

00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:55.060
And it ended up being useful in lots of other ways. Basically cog is a way that you can make a text file

00:59:55.060 --> 01:00:00.300
like a readme.md and put little bits of Python in the middle of it. Not because you're trying to

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:05.380
display that code to people, but because you want the results of that code to be part of your document.

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.080
A little bit like a, a Jinja, right? A template maybe.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.100
Exactly. But it's a little bit backwards because Jinja starts with the idea. I mean,

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:16.640
Jinja is, well, it is like Jinja actually. I should, I shouldn't say that. It's just like Jinja.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.760
But instead of being HTML, you want it to be text or something, right?

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.660
Right. It can be anything you want. Jinja is particular to HTML in some ways,

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:30.460
but cog is completely agnostic. The bigger difference from Jinja with cog is that the output of your code

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:36.060
can go into the document so that you process, you run the document, the output of your code

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:41.640
becomes part of the document. So sort of the input file and the output file are the same file so that

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:47.620
you get sort of an item potent kind of processing of the file. So you can have a readme.md. You run cog

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:52.380
on it. You still just have a readme.md, but now you've got the results of the computation in the file.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:58.680
So for instance, I use this in the coverage.py docs. There's a database schema for the SQLite data

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:04.120
file that coverage.py writes. That schema is in a string in a Python file someplace, but I also want

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:10.600
it to be in my docs. So I use cog in the restructured text file to go and get the string from the Python

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:17.200
code and splat it into the restructured text file so that I know that the two are the same because

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.120
there's one source of truth and an automated process to bring it into the restructured text file.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:26.960
You know how they say there's like two hard problems in computer science, naming things,

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:31.720
caching validation and off by one errors. Yes. I feel like maybe a fourth one should be

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:35.760
identifying and controlling and keeping the one source of truth.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.980
One source of truth is a big thing with me and all of these kinds of processes where

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:46.420
you want to make it convenient to write information, but you also want to make it convenient to read

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:50.920
information. And so you might want to publish information in more than one place. For instance,

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:57.100
I mentioned that my changelog is in a .rst file, but it also goes into GitHub releases because people

01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:02.480
want to read it in GitHub releases. So I get the information out of the changelog and automatically

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.260
publish it into GitHub releases. Yeah.

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:09.800
Cog has found a lot of use. Simon Willison has been very positive about Cog. He uses it in a number

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:16.020
of places to keep his documentation up to date. I've used Cog to an extreme extent in my GitHub profile

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:22.300
to, for instance, grab information from PyPI where I mentioned what my projects are and things like

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:27.100
that. Yeah. Yeah. Cog is one of those things that started small and it's just has chugged along for a

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:33.120
long time. And I continue to find more uses for it. Yeah. That's great. Colin says using Cog to document

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:44.360
CLI tools is Chef's Kiss. Yeah. So very nice. Very nice. We're getting to the end here. We're almost out of time, but luckily we're also almost out of things to talk about. Well, we're not out of them. We're stopping.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:58.720
There's a lot. There's a lot. This is a small sampling. But here's one by Haidang that's awesome tools for the readme profile. So this is a lot of, let's do the test. Click on their profile and see how it looks. You know what I mean?

01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.000
Yep.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:19.940
Got to get a little more in there. So this is more of a collection, but we have readme's for projects, but also readme's for humans, right? You know, if you go to my account, you see a particular thing. Some people have really fancied that up with lots of things. And this project here talks about, well, what kind of cool stuff can you put on there that people might see?

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.800
I haven't looked at yours recently. What's your profile look like?

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:46.740
So it's not as visual as this. It has a few badges, but I used Cog to, for instance, pull in the six most recent blog posts onto my page. I wanted to do recent tweets, but that was going to be hard because Twitter API wanted me to authenticate. And half the time I turn away when I'm asked to authenticate against the thing, because that's the hardest part of the whole thing. And it takes away all the fun.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:04:13.200
The main thing I used Cog for, I used Cog on my readme. And one of the things I did with it was to write Python code to generate that markdown syntax for badges and to put together shields.io badge URLs. So both of those things are complicated, right? Shields.io is amazingly powerful, but how you actually put all the bits of information into the URL is hard to get right. And it's fiddly. There's like ampersands and you have to quote them in the markdown or something.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.040
It's a regular expression, yeah.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:29.140
Yeah, I mean, it's just too intense. So I wrote Python functions to put together shields.io URLs. And then I called those Python functions from the Cog code in my readme.md. And there's a GitHub action that runs the Cog on it.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:44.880
Whenever I publish a blog post, my blog publishing triggers the GitHub action that recalcs my GitHub readme. So the latest blog post is on the top of the GitHub readme. Like I said, you can take this a long way. I may have gone too far with this.

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:45.420
Oh, I love it.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:05:04.560
But yeah, it's cool to see how the tools can come together and you can automate all of these processes. Again, to go back to one source of truth, my blog is the one source of truth about what are my blog posts. But the information is also on my GitHub readme because I thought that would be a useful thing for people to see when they look for me on GitHub.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:16.120
Yeah, that's fantastic. All right. So this project here is like a whole host of things like that that you could do. And I love the use of Cog and the GitHub actions just to chain it together.

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:24.780
Awesome tool for readme profile. It's sort of like a blank catalog. Like you might want to put this on your profile or put that on your profile.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:31.360
If it was 1994 and you wanted a blink tag, here's a whole bunch of or a little animated diggy GIF you could figure out.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:39.380
So you get these graphs of like what were your last year contributions over time or when are you most likely to?

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:39.720
Yep.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:46.840
Some more badges. Like here's the latest blog posts, which is a thing that people can pull in if they don't want to do more of it themselves.

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.160
Yep.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:54.060
How much time you spent coding in various languages per month or per week, weekly here. That's pretty wild.

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:58.060
Yeah. He's got a lot of things here, like what you're listening to on Spotify.

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:02.900
Yeah. Do they have emails, one of your coding activities? Cause I spend a lot of time in email and I wish.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:06.460
Are you typing code in your email? You might be doing it wrong.

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:10.000
I'm just spending a lot of time in email. I wish I didn't.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.320
Okay. So it's got a, what time of the day? Are you a morning person? Are you a,

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:20.460
it has a snake game that goes around and races like a centipede.

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:26.240
You know, you're right. This is very reminiscent of the early, like geo cities kind of internet where

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:32.160
everything flashed and blinked and looked cool and had contrasting colors and stuff like that.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:36.040
Yeah. So people, I mean, we're only like a third of the way through this game. People can,

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.780
they can give themselves trophies. They can give themselves, I think this is stack overflow. Yeah.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.140
Stack overflow reputation.

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:47.700
There's just a ton of different stuff you can put together. And I think it all comes back to,

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:53.020
you know, besides like maybe overdoing with digging animated GIFs and blink tags. I think it comes back

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:59.140
to your GitHub profile is a little bit like your resume and how much can you say more than just,

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.340
Oh, I forked Django.

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:05.880
Right. And you want, I mean, the point of the profile is to let people know about you and

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:11.300
hopefully they'll be interested in you in whatever way you want them to be interested. So all of these

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:17.080
things that attract attention and let you can choose something here that sort of has your vibe

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:22.580
in whatever way. For instance, my page is very text heavy, but that's my vibe. That's the way I am.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:26.880
And if that's not for you, then you should look for someone else's profile. But if you want to know

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:32.360
what I'm listening to on Spotify, then that's a thing to put on a profile page. So it's great. I

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:37.880
mean, self-expression is a wonderful thing. And the fact that GitHub lets you build your own profile

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.280
and that there are all these tools to do whatever you want with it. It's amazing.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:46.280
It is amazing. All right. I think this is probably going to be it for our final thing to cover and

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:53.580
read me and friends. Let's close this out just really quickly with a, give us the, the 7.0 story on

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:58.220
coverage. Oh, coverage on 5.7.0. Yeah. That's a big deal. All right. I mean, if you're going to

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:02.620
make that big of a number, it might not be a big deal. This is a tricky thing. So really what happened

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:06.760
was I was looking through the bugs that people were reporting and a lot of them had to do with,

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:11.480
it couldn't find my source file where I said it should put the source file. And I was answering with,

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:15.580
well, you have to do these tricky things in your configuration file. And I thought maybe that should

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:22.760
be simpler. So really the reason it's a 7.0 is because I made things better, but I also think you

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:26.840
might have to change your settings in order for them to still work the way they used to work.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:33.160
So when you look at the change log for coverage.py 7.0, there's no like amazing big thing. The biggest

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:38.300
feature change is that when you get a text report out, now it can be in markdown format instead of

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:44.800
in plain text format. And that's cool, but that's not like a 7.0 level feature. The real change is,

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.120
I think it's going to be better, but a few of you might have to update your settings. And I wanted to

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:54.000
make it clear to people that that was going to happen. So I bumped the number to 7.0.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.260
That seems totally reasonable and still going strong. It's a beta one right now. When do you foresee

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:04.800
this becoming the pip install coverage sort of version?

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.160
That's a great question. I have to admit, to be perfectly honest with you, that I have been

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:15.520
disappointed in the past at how few people try out betas. So I'm putting this out there in a

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:20.040
disciplined way and I'm trying to talk about it, like go and try the beta, but eventually I'm going

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.860
to get tired of waiting for people and I'm just going to publish it. And if the bug reports come

01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:28.060
in then, then we'll deal with them then because there's only so much you can do to get people's

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:28.900
attention on a beta.

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:32.520
Absolutely. I can totally understand that. All right. Final two questions before you get out of here.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.500
If you're going to write some Python code, what editor are you using these days?

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:37.060
Vim.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:37.980
Vim. Right on.

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:40.200
And I do not have any code completion plugins.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:40.760
Okay.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.560
I've said this before. I'm very low tech.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.480
Perfect. And then notable PyPI package. I kind of feel like we've covered a bunch,

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.140
but if there anything you want to give a shout out.

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:53.560
We did cover a bunch. You know, I've been very enamored of Rich, I have to say. It's very cool.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.900
I'm looking forward to hearing more about what Textual is going to be for building

01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:05.520
terminal UI interfaces for applications. But Rich is astoundingly competent at what it tries to do.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.960
Yeah. And what they're doing on the terminal is just nuts.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.560
It is.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.380
Nuts in a good way.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:14.000
I only discovered just the other day, maybe people don't know this, that you can,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.020
one of the Rich styles, and this is a feature that terminals support and Rich is just tapping

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:21.960
into it, but it gave a convenient way to do it. You can output text, you know, that's red or that's

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:27.140
bold. You can output text that's a link where the word in the terminal is just, you know, click here

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:32.440
and behind it is the URL you told to have it. And then you can click the link in the terminal

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.540
and go and visit things. Astounding.

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:41.900
I'm familiar with terminals detecting links, but not having a different link text than the actual link,

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.120
right?

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.200
Yes. That's what I'm talking about. I didn't know it could do that.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.040
Yeah. That's nuts.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.700
Yeah. Cool. Well, that's definitely a good one. All right. Final call to action. People are thinking

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.600
about their projects. I want to get started with some of these ideas. What do you tell them?

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.320
Think about your users. Think about who you're writing for. And it's different people at different

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:04.900
times and write, write words. I actually want to say one more thing. We talk about change logs as being

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:09.720
really good for the users of your library. I find when I sit down to edit my change logs that I

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:15.040
understand my own product better and that I think about the features I've built in a new way and

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.760
sometimes actually go back and change them because in the process of trying to describe what happened,

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.320
I learned something. Yeah.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.600
Writing for readers is great. Writing, you will learn things when you write. Write more. It'll be good.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:31.360
I can definitely see that. You're like, I want to say, but it doesn't quite do this unless I change

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.500
this other thing in code and then it'll be true to what I tried, wanted to say here. So yeah. Yeah.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.940
Perfect. Yes. All right, Ned. Thanks for coming back on the show. Great to have you here.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.380
